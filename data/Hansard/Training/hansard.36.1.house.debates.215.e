The House met at 11.00 a.m. 
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RELIEF COORDINATION ACT 
Unfortunately, it was not deemed to be votable by the committee.  
It was done ad hoc by the department.  
It is vital that there be more transparency and fairness in the process.  
That was a quote from the minister asking for transparency, negotiations and consultation. 
The time to put these in place is now.  
Bill C-387 would do just that.  
We had many problems when AIDA was first unveiled. 
That comment came from a federal bureaucrat.  
This has to change. 
The Canadian Federation of Agriculture stated in a letter addressed to me: 
Ad hoc programs provide ad hoc solutions. 
Consistency is the key word here. 
One region cannot be pitted against another one. 
I thank the House for the time to put forward Bill C-387. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
It fits with the agreements we made with the World Trade Organization. 
As a result all provinces with the exception of Nova Scotia joined the program.  
The federal government has responded by setting aside $900 million. 
Are you going to spend it?  
We certainly intend to spend it. 
By this Friday every province will be in receipt of some money. 
The government does not just wait for problems to arise. 
It will assist Canada's farmers. 
The classic example of this is whole farm safety nets. 
The federal government has signed agreements with all the provinces. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
The AIDA program is probably a joke, as far as I am concerned. 
This is not bankable. 
The Liberal government promised before Christmas that the AIDA program would be bankable. 
No banks will look at it today.  
They are wasting their money. 
People are not even filing them because they are so ridiculous.  
Not even the parliamentary secretary has agreed to come to talk to them.  
If the AIDA program is the third line of defence, God help those farmers. 
They will die before they ever get a dollar out of the AIDA program.  
The government has been warned about this for the last five years by Reform. 
This program will do absolutely nothing to resolve that problem. 
We need a long term fix for farmers in which they can participate. 
I will touch a bit on the Canadian Wheat Board. 
I must thank and congratulate the auditor general. 
And the government is talking about providing a safety net program? 
At least there they get food and clothing.  
Is that such a criminal act? 
If that is a criminal act, we should probably all be behind bars. 
Income tax is one of them. 
The AIDA program is really doing nothing. 
I have held nine town hall meetings in my constituency. 
People have been phoning me, telling me that they do not qualify. 
That is almost half the price, while input costs are still rising. 
Every year there are input costs for fertilizer and machinery. 
They have to accept what the market will offer them. 
This is very discouraging for farmers. 
The government better realize that. 
That is why the farming industry in western Canada has shrunk. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
First, there is the income security aspect. 
We have worked to improve our income security system. 
We are continuing to do so in accordance with our own needs and model. 
We have some experience of the disaster program. 
We oppose this sort of practice.  
Here again, we do not share his opinion. 
There is no consistency in agriculture. 
And in this regard, the member for Brandon-Souris has shown his sensitivity towards farmers.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
This is a very good initiative. 
I listened very carefully to the member for Brandon-Souris. 
He said that it had to be a bankable program. 
He said it had to be a whole farm program. 
We have a whole farm program. 
The credit union manager in Dodsland is on the record as having said that. 
This is certainly not a long term program. 
Professional accountants are saying that it is extremely complicated. 
On April 6 it went on to say: 
They also worry about how they will put in crop this spring. 
These are the very real issues that are of concern.  
We are asking where is that immediate emergency assistance for Canadian farm families?  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Yes, you will have your five minutes reply at one minute to 12. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
It was farmers night for Renfrew county. 
He listened to them. 
They got their point of view across. 
I am absolutely dumbfounded, speechless.  
I might add that we should on occasion try to help the opposition too. 
Perhaps we should muzzle them on occasion.  
It is not their fault that they are in the position they are. 
In recent years the effectiveness of those systems has been amply demonstrated on several occasions.  
I notice the member for Brandon-Souris was talking about laying plans. 
He is just a big yokel on occasion.  
We know what farmers mean to this country. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The parliamentary secretary spoke about short memories. 
There should have been an opportunity not to have to take the NISA.  
Its members have short memories as well. 
He understands the issues very well, certainly more so than the government. 
It is not working. 
That is not happening. 
Why is the government so insistent on continuing in this foolish direction? 
Why would it not want to have some input from other people? 
I do not know why it will not do so. 
Perhaps it is the autocratic way in which the Liberals have formed this government. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
BILL C-78-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Madam Speaker, you caught me a bit off guard. 
This is definitely a highly technical bill. 
The board will manage the billions of dollars in these funds annually. 
Neither will those who are retired, who contributed in the past. 
For the following reason. 
It is him who appoints the eight members of the nominating committee. 
The President of the Treasury Board will appoint the chair of the nominating committee. 
He is the only one making that appointment. 
He will appoint a member among people who are in receipt of a pension. 
These are the eight people who will make up the nominating committee. 
When it is not the riot stick, it is cayenne pepper. 
So, that is what it does.  
It is a dictatorship. 
The other 50% comes from the government. 
Is it $4 billion, $5 billion or $6 billion? 
He is using closure precisely because he does not want to hear the whole truth.  
But the government does not know about that concept. 
Let us take a look at what is done elsewhere. 
What have others done with the unexpected surpluses? 
The federal government will not consider such an approach.  
Each of these plans has a management committee.  
In Quebec, there is a collegial approach to deciding how surpluses are handled. 
Decisions are taken as well. 
All the elements were there. 
This government is thick. 
The government is close-minded. 
But with the government, it is always confrontation.  
It makes no sense. 
Here we are faced with a structure in which contributors are completely pushed aside. 
This is not normal.  
But he is doing this on the backs of others. 
Everyone is going to remember that.  
Madam Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. 
Is the Quebec government pension plan a shared risk, shared management plan?  
There are risks in investing just as there are benefits in it.  
So the plan is not more risky than any other. 
It is a great idea. 
Normally, the main stakeholders are involved in managing the funds. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I would like to know whether my colleague agrees with me. 
The government is going to help itself to surpluses without workers' consent. 
Workers have always been opposed, as have governments.  
Today, the government is setting a precedent. 
This is an unacceptable precedent. 
The government ought not to be taking the country in that direction.  
We parliamentarians are not even being given the opportunity to say what we think. 
We no longer know which way this House is going to go. 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member is right.  
We will no longer have any valid arguments. 
How can we argue that he is wrong.  
We have reached a point where we no longer have any valid arguments.  
He had a bill like this one in mind. 
The EI surpluses must not be used for such purposes.  
The Bloc and the NDP have sort of the same mindset.  
I have a question for the hon. member. 
He did not understand the difference between shared risk and shared management. 
I clearly understand the concept of sharing risk. 
Obviously this is an anomaly that must be corrected.  
This provision means that surpluses can thus continue to exist and even grow indefinitely.  
This has become an issue of very real importance since 1991. 
The management of the surpluses raises another issue. 
Who has the ownership of the $30 billion surplus? 
The committee reported to the president in December 1996.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask a question of the parliamentary secretary.  
Now it wants to take this surplus and bring it into its income.  
What benefit will this give to the pensioners and to the employees, if any? 
I cannot see any. 
Canadian taxpayers are not going to see the cash. 
What is the benefit for the employees? 
Is the benefit to make the Liberal government look good?  
It is an interesting reversal.  
I know that the hon. member would want that. 
Unfortunately the NDP is making sure that its union friends are protected in this process. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I am astonished at the hon. member's remarks. 
I wonder whether he is not in fact trying to mislead the public. 
I cannot see any open-mindedness in what the minister is doing.  
Our colleague has made a deliberate and intentional error.  
This is not defending the interests of pensioners or taxpayers. 
The hon. member indicated that he would have liked another six months of discussion. 
That is the reason for time allocation. 
The President of the Treasury Board has been open minded. 
It is one sided.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I have a very straightforward question. 
The government has paid the surplus. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Shame on the government for even thinking about doing something like this.  
Right at the very beginning the government talks about privatizing the pension plan. 
We need to have somebody to run it.  
Ex-Liberals collecting a pension of course are the first to come to mind. 
He says because the government assumes all the risks. 
The government of course means that the taxpayer assumes all the risks. 
It gets a little bit complex here. 
Contributions are invested and there is investment income as well. 
Now we have a surplus. 
That logic is wrong. 
It cannot stand the test of scrutiny. 
That is why we are saying the government is being heavy handed. 
The government does not want debate to continue on this bill. 
It knows it cannot substantiate and support its flawed logic.  
It started to build for three reasons.  
First, the government imposed a wage freeze on civil servants. 
Since 1991 they have not had an increase. 
The actuaries in the 1980s had anticipated that salaries would go up. 
If salaries are frozen, benefits are frozen. 
What happened to inflation in the 1990s? 
Today the plan is still benefiting from these high interest rate bonds. 
We know that that increase in the surplus is going to stop. 
You have to pay more taxes. 
You have to pay more cash''. 
I do not think that is a justifiable position. 
The money should stay in the plan to cover the shortfall. 
They did it courtesy of the pension plan of the civil service.  
The plan is going to be privatized over a number of years. 
That perhaps is not a bad idea.  
It is unfortunate that the capital markets are overly inflated right now. 
We certainly hope the Liberals can guarantee a decent return on the funds invested. 
If they cannot, they will be back to the taxpayer. 
We want to make sure that does not happen. 
We are not advocating that it go to the unions. 
All we are saying is protect the taxpayers. 
Protect them now, protect them next year and protect them the year after. 
There is nothing this government wants to do other than make itself look good.  
We know the Minister of Finance is building up surpluses here, there and everywhere. 
I have talked about them before. 
That is why it is smoke and mirrors from that party.  
He still has over eight minutes remaining. 
With his agreement we will proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
I would urge this government and the Minister of Finance to seriously consider this initiative.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
HOSPICE OF WATERLOO REGION 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Last week the hospice held its annual fundraiser. 
I would like to extend my congratulations to an excellent event. 
I commend the Hospice of Waterloo Region and all its dedicated volunteers. 
The hon. member for Scarborough Centre.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Doris Daniel, Shirley McDonald, Jean Kennedy and Thelma Thomson. 
Each of these people have served the hospital for 40 years plus.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
During this week, let us honour the victims of the Armenian genocide. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The House welcomes Dustin and together we salute him for his courage.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, volunteers are the glue that holds the community together. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Today, 18 cases are on hold pending the outcome of this case. 
It needs parliament to back it up.  
Reform is reflecting the community view. 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Politicians do not always recognize the problems of Canadians.  
Governments must fight this alarming problem. 
To do so, they must look at all the causes.  
I share their grief deeply.  
1849 BURNING OF THE PARLIAMENT OF CANADA 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, 150 years ago yesterday, some sad events took place in Montreal. 
This is a very sad episode in Canadian history.  
Disputes, even serious ones, must be settled within a democratic framework. 
The Patriotes paid the ultimate price. 
Let us never forget that.  
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
I think Canadians are witnessing the shattering breakup of the Reform glass house.  
Call it what they may, it is still shameful.  
YARMOUTH TOWN AND COUNTRY SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Sports have always played an integral part in our local communities. 
ALZHEIMER SOCIETY OF CAMBRIDGE 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
The economic cost of Alzheimer disease is estimated at $4 billion per year.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Our sympathies and compassion do not seem to be enough.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
The poverty rate has not improved in 20 years. 
The evidence is very clear. 
The gap between the rich and the poor is growing. 
It is the Liberal government policies that are to blame.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
That is what that is about.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The exact details of the naval embargo have not been worked out yet. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There is an attempt to balance the two.  
The hon. member for Red Deer.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The two are connected.  
We will do so. 
That will be taken into consideration in terms of the actual implementation.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think I have now answered that question twice. 
I will do it a third time just so they will fully understand.  
The two have to work together.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The UN secretary general will travel to Russia this week. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The Prime Minister is very anxious that we follow up. 
At the same time the secretary general will be advancing the same purposes. 
That would be a very major step forward.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a variety of plans out there. 
I do not think we need any new ones, particularly. 
I think what we have to get is agreement on the plans. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, finally we are seeing some promising movement on the diplomatic front. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I think that will require that again there be some accommodation worked out.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
In fact it may drive a wedge between NATO and Russia.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is the hon. member who is using the word blockade. 
We hope many other countries will also agree to that. 
We do not want to increase the tension. 
We want to resolve this.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is the party that said it would defend the rights of the taxpayers.  
This money belongs to the taxpayers. 
The government will give the pensioners everything it has promised them by law. 
This surplus belongs to the taxpayers.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It affects 300,000 employees and 30 million Canadians.  
What is it afraid of?  
How does it dare do this?  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I fundamentally disagree with the comment made by the hon. member.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is clear. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. 
Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague is wrong. 
Once again he does not understand what is going on.  
Not a cent has been charged to the public servants. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Will you have a vote or will you not?  
The hon. President of the Treasury Board.  
No public servant paid a cent of that $8 billion deficit. 
The taxpayers were in charge of paying and that is still the situation.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
How can the government explain that?  
Public servants have worked hard and deserve their pension plan.  
However, they did not share any of the risk in the pension plan. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
They have to make a bigger contribution.  
Yet after only four hours, the government is trying to shut down debate. 
What is the government hiding? 
Why does it not want a full exploration of these very important questions?  
Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague misunderstands the question.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Progress is being made. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The member talks about grassroots aboriginal people. 
He represents the Nisga'a First Nation. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister should get her facts right. 
Only 2,300 actually live in my constituency.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell the member what the Nisga'a people are appalled at. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is about plutonium. 
Will the minister listen to the growing chorus of Canadians?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I answered this question last week. 
Our department has not received a request.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I think the minister's stonewalling is nothing short of arrogance.  
They say the plans are irresponsible and that an accident is waiting to happen.  
What will the government do about the concerns which Canadians have about plutonium?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We have the highest standards of transporting these goods.  
There are 27 million shipments of dangerous goods annually. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Chris Wicke still has not been charged.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans is looking at the issue. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
As far as the federal government is concerned, we want to heighten awareness. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
He and I have had the opportunity to discuss the particulars of this matter. 
He has asked for further information. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
There have now been over 24,000 forms sent out. 
A number of the provinces are already delivering cheques.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I wonder if someone could explain that for the people of my riding.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yes, the minister and the department are very aware of the decision. 
There should be no impact on the export of products. 
Three options were considered in terms of the decision. 
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION PLANS 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
That makes us wonder:
If that is true, why does he need to change the legislation? 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member does not have his facts straight. 
Federal dollars are flowing to farmers in a number of provinces.  
That is not the way to do it.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
He went on to say: 
When a committee chooses to meet in camera , all matters are confidential. 
The House must take action and protect its authority and the authority of its committees. 
The hon. member mentions a specific member, the hon. member for Provencher. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
We will endeavour to get that information.  
The hon. member across says ``It was not''. 
I will nevertheless ask the hon. member to address that upon his return.  
I think we have set the stage. 
It was said in the House of Commons. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It was a nice try, but it certainly was not a point of order.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu-Nicolet-Becancour, BQ):
The reason is quite simple. 
In my province of British Columbia six courts have been closed. 
That money could then be used to engage in prevention. 
It could be put into education programs for children. 
We could deal with prevention and substance abuse issues.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I should not have to be standing here in the House today speaking to it. 
Some questions have to be asked. 
Why is it necessary to begin speaking about a seemingly isolated report from a committee? 
Why was the report not dealt with by the House of Commons? 
Where do we go from here?  
This is indicative of most committee work in the House of Commons. 
We all agreed on it. 
If we all agreed on it, where did it go from there?  
What are you doing about it?'' 
I am going to show that in a few minutes. 
Do they all work like this? 
A lot of members in this House of Commons go to committees. 
I do not think so. 
It does not even come to a vote in the House of Commons.  
What is in this report? 
There were no hidden agendas with this individual. 
Why do we not have televised committee meetings in all committee rooms?'' 
The end result of course is ``Well, that does not matter''.  
That is absolutely correct. 
Look at the House today. 
The report acknowledges that room 253-D is used for broadcasting purposes in the House. 
Should we have permanent facilities, much like we do in 253? 
No, we think there is a better idea, we say. 
Let us find out what that is.  
I wholeheartedly agree with that and so did the committee.  
What else does it say? 
This is an excellent idea, a good idea. 
Let us implement that. 
That was one of the recommendations.  
The committee intends to monitor this''. 
``It should be gavel to gavel filming''. 
``The cameras must be in fixed positions while the committee is in session''. 
Nobody has complaints about that. 
That is fine, no problems. 
No one will argue with that. 
I could not agree more. 
It is wrong what those folks are doing.  
No, that is not the case.  
What about grassroots' input as compared to top down? 
I think it is possible.  
Where do we go from here? 
In fact, I thought the level of debate was really quite high.  
This is not about getting one's face on television. 
This is an important issue and yet it is likely it will not be televised. 
What is wrong with it? 
Why should we not have it open? 
There is nothing wrong with that.  
They agree with them and yet they still go nowhere.  
I am about to take issue with this. 
Why has this report fallen on deaf ears? 
Why has nothing happened? 
It must make their work worthwhile. 
What is wrong with the people over there? 
Why do they not insist on it?  
Mr. Speaker, I am the chair of the standing committee concerned. 
We are dealing with concurrence in our report No. 48. 
The member has picked out this report. 
There are five main recommendations.  
The first one deals with the situation the member described. 
That has been quite successful. 
There is a procedure whereby committees go into that particular room. 
Recommendation one of the report dealt with that.  
There is a procedure for doing that. 
My colleague, the House leader for the Reform Party referred in part to that. 
That was the second recommendation.  
There is a discussion about that.  
In my experience they have been very well received. 
The report contains four recommendations, which the hon. member has brushed over. 
It is a healthy discussion and something comes from it.  
That the debate be now adjourned.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Otherwise we will be going to a 30 minute vote.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is a motion before the House. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
They also note that car manufacturers oppose the use of MMT.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Currently many young people continue smoking despite clear evidence that it causes cancer.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Question No. 190- Mr. John Cummins: 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
(a) Spawn-on-kelp licences:
(d) and (e) Biological impact:
Some commercial harvesting licences have been removed from the fishery. 
Question No. 211- Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire: 
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
One of the other things the government does is to redefine terms in the dictionary. 
I am looking at page 51 of the bill under ``persons considered to be married''. 
I find this rather interesting. 
Therefore, the marriage ceremony is irrelevant. 
The government has redefined the definition of the term marriage. 
I will leave that point for Canadians to contemplate. 
That debate will continue on another day.  
That is an affront to the democratic process. 
We will move it to committee''. 
We will no doubt have closure at committee. 
We will likely be refused to hear any witnesses. 
I can see closure being moved at third reading. 
That is how arrogant the government has become.  
It is a dreadful day for Canadians.  
They came here talking about their concern for the taxpayers and their money. 
There are many issues that come to this table. 
He stated earlier that it is taxpayers' money. 
Is that not interesting?  
Canadians want their money back now. 
Does he believe they should get it back? 
As I have said, the surplus arose because of circumstances. 
We have a debt that it let run out of control. 
Thankfully, because we have been here pushing hard it has brought that under control.  
That is what this bill is all about.  
I refer to an article in the Ottawa Citizen on March 4, 1997. 
It is a raid. 
They cannot have it both ways. 
They should be honest and say what their position is.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's remarks with great interest.  
I would appreciate the member's remarks on that.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want the member for St. Albert to clarify something.  
It is going to kick in before the election.  
Again, it will not be available until next year. 
Here the Liberals are taking the money from the pension plan. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague to comment on the following.  
It just brings it into general revenue. 
Now it is raiding this fund.  
Mr. Speaker, it is a good question. 
We are not talking about tax relief. 
Look at the mess we got ourselves into courtesy of the Liberal government. 
Taxpayers have worked darned hard. 
They have had to slog and pay high taxes. 
I say that is the wrong way.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to rise today. 
That was a great government. 
The hon. member says that was a great government. 
I can see that we are changing the guard. 
In fact, look at what it owns.  
It could be the world. 
That is what we hear in this place from members opposite. 
Who is going to benefit from these changes? 
I wish to point out something which I find rather interesting. 
We went through the exercise of having a vote in this place. 
We voted on a motion to adjourn the debate. 
I am sure the public who were watching were somewhat confused. 
On the surface that would seem to make sense. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for St. Albert does have a point. 
Madam Speaker, all I need is a bit of time to do that. 
I can see the link quite clearly. 
I do not know how that had anything to do with this bill.  
That is exactly what it was about. 
So what do we do. 
The question here is, whose surplus is it anyway? 
We have a collective agreement. 
I will read from Hansard the NDP's view. 
They are not the employers' money to use as they see fit. 
They are deferred wages. 
It is our money speaking on behalf of working people''. 
That has long been a position of the New Democratic Party. 
That is absolutely clear. 
Then we get the other extreme that comes from members of the Reform Party. 
It is the taxpayers who are the forgotten partner in this debate.  
We have pretty extreme positions dealing with an issue. 
The government has been successful in eliminating a $42 billion deficit-overdraft. 
I understand where the NDP is coming from. 
It is fighting for its brothers and sisters in the union. 
It does not belong to the union. 
It does not belong to the government. 
Did we say that?  
The member asks whether they said that. 
Let us turn around and extrapolate it. 
Obligations are being made. 
It makes no sense whatsoever.  
There is absolutely no doubt about that.  
The reality is that society has changed. 
Our country has matured. 
That is what this is all about. 
This brings me to another point. 
It is not complex.  
No, it is not complex. 
It is pretty straightforward. 
That is not what we are talking about. 
They can say all they want about disagreeing with government policies. 
They can say all they want about criticizing the direction or philosophy of the government. 
It will be arm's length from employees and pensioners. 
No member of parliament will be allowed to sit on it. 
That is the way it should be. 
There will be 12 qualified directors to be appointed by the government. 
I do not know who else would appoint them.  
There will be an opportunity to debate that report. 
We can refer it to committee. 
There is no question the accountability is there.  
That is saying there is an opportunity for co-management, an opportunity for input. 
I understand that position. 
Turn it over to management. 
That is what is happening.  
We do not need to be going through this every 15 years. 
This is causing some stress, some anxiety.  
I understand the labour position. 
This is responsible legislation. 
It is fair to the taxpayer. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
They have been replaced with the following, and I read from the bill itself: 
Nowhere in the bill does it define what that is exactly.  
They would like to simply turn this debate around on that one issue.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Give us a break.  
I will give the member a break all right. 
Let us deal with the important issues. 
We are not redefining family. 
We are not redefining marriage. 
Were they paid on a family basis and are they recognized in that capacity?  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The member did not answer the question. 
Madam Speaker, this proves my point. 
You are the one who put it into the bill.  
Well, they are trying to understand what the word conjugal means. 
I will allow them to go to their own dictionaries to figure that one out. 
I am not sure that they would be able to grasp it in any event.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Why are we not doing that? 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for a relevant question.  
Let me first deal with the improvements. 
That is an improvement. 
The hon. member's own critic said so in Hansard .  
I have outlined lots of benefits that will be improvements for the members. 
I have a question for my hon. colleague. 
Reformers used to idolize the debt board. 
Will the hon. member please tell me how they can deal with this hypocrisy?  
I understand that position. 
They understand the burden on their kids and their grandchildren. 
That is what this will do.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the first question I would put concerns the role of the legislator. 
It refuses to negotiate in the knowledge that it will legislate in the end. 
The government seems to be saying ``We have a majority. 
All that counts is the dictatorship of the majority. 
The government deliberately held up negotiations.  
This is yet another example.  
That surplus is currently estimated at about $25 billion. 
The government used this surplus to solve its deficit problem. 
There were many other options. 
For example, the government could have reduced the premiums.  
Nonetheless, the government ignored that option. 
But we must face reality. 
It wants to get its hands on the surpluses. 
It has already done it with the employment insurance fund. 
And there are other instances. 
The government has also cut transfers to the provinces. 
The only thing the government wants is to get its hands on the money. 
And the government just goes merrily on its way.  
Such measures prevent retirees from getting a little more.  
This is absolutely outrageous.  
But it is Canadian taxpayers who pay for the deficit. 
When there are surpluses, Canadian taxpayers should benefit from them.  
I would like to know how many deficits there were. 
What was the amount of these deficits? 
This is not what the government is doing. 
I would be remiss not to mention at this point the Singer employees. 
Today, I understand why the government objected to that. 
It refused to budge. 
Nevertheless, the injustice still remains. 
For years, it did not contribute, whereas its employees were still paying. 
I believe today this should weigh heavily on the government's conscience. 
It is not just the Canadian taxpayer. 
It is not just the government that paid for all of this. 
The federal public servants also paid for it. 
It is the one that has come to their defence the most. 
Most of those who voted for all of the members of this House are workers.  
It is the only party that has defended them. 
Nor will we today. 
We will fight this bill to the utmost of our limited abilities. 
We have very little leeway. 
The same thing, probably. 
At one point they will say ``That is enough. 
We will move on to clause by clause adoption''. 
It seems to me that this government uses closure to excess. 
Accordingly, and for these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will oppose this bill.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
It seems to me one precious part of this argument is missing. 
It is irrelevant how much money physically is in or is not in the plan. 
The Reform Party's position is even more ludicrous. 
The Reform Party is saying to leave the money in the plan. 
This particular intervener talked about defending the workers of Canada. 
I suspect that those workers are also taxpayers. 
This is completely wrong, in my opinion.  
They liked the model. 
The Quebec tradition in this regard is rather effective. 
But there are surpluses right now. 
We will not improve your plan; we are only interested in taking the money''. 
Again, this is not right.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I apologize for cutting the Reform Party out of two 10 minute slots.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to keep my remarks cogent.  
I have speaking notes provided by the government. 
I have the bill here. 
Here is the problem. 
The use of conjugal in this context may lead to problems with this legislation. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Obviously the bill is hugely complex. 
I think the government is doing this in a sneaky way. 
In doing that it abdicates its responsibility as a legislator.  
I will say one brief word on this point. 
The Concise Oxford Dictionary states that conjugate means to unite sexually.  
They have talked all around it. 
There are many issues here. 
That was a promise it made and ultimately broke.  
We saw the same thing happen with Employment Insurance. 
What does this government do? 
It raids that $26 billion fund.  
A $30 billion surplus has accumulated and it says ``The means justify the end. 
I think that is reprehensible.  
Is there no pool of money that is beyond the reach of the government? 
It should be absolutely ashamed. 
People on this side of the House want to see an honest and open debate. 
Sadly we will not get it from that gang over there.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I discussed the aspect that this is a defined benefits plan. 
Quite frankly it has nothing to do with the money sitting in the plan. 
Various legislative bodies from time to time say that should be invested. 
I would like to point out another very basic aspect of this plan. 
Most people would conclude that this has been a very generous plan.  
However, our generosity has to stop when we start talking about this notional surplus.  
How would members opposite deal with the surplus? 
Would they physically give money or enhance the benefit packages of the beneficiaries? 
That would be breaking the original terms of the agreement. 
However, there is no plan and there is no physical money in the plan. 
The plan is financed from the general revenues of the Government of Canada. 
Is this called progress? 
Is this called integrity or accountability? 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
We in the official opposition certainly cannot. 
We are getting a little closer to the truth now. 
This board will not be accountable to the auditor general. 
The government staunchly refused to allow that board to be accountable to the auditor general. 
This is something which the Liberals, when in opposition, railed against. 
What have they done? 
They have beaten the record of the Tories. 
We are up to the 53rd or 54th time.  
Yes, they paid down the debt. 
They beat the deficit on the backs of Canadians.  
Boy, did he pull in the votes.  
I want to close by reaffirming that this is all about trust. 
Who can trust the Liberals? 
The record speaks for itself. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having an opportunity to say a few words. 
All of this has been documented.  
Once upon a time the Liberals even saw through this perspective. 
Not any more of course.  
Who has been affected is another question. 
It reminds one of the old Irish proverb which I have used before:
Once they get on that side of the House how quickly they forget. 
They even promised parliamentary reform when they sat on this side of the House. 
What do we get today? 
It is a total sham.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
We will do that again if and when the need arises.  
Reform Party members in the past supported the government position. 
Talk about changing positions. 
They flip flop as if they are acrobatics on the other side. 
Canadian taxpayers feel secure in knowing that it is covered. 
We are clearly showing prudence and doing the right thing. 
Every member will in fact be protected by the actions of the government.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried. 
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The majority of hospitals do not follow those rules. 
They provide substantial samples, et cetera of breast milk substitutes.  
The research highlighted the significant benefits of breast feeding. 
The research is very clear. 
The health benefits of breast feeding cannot be overstated.  
I ask the parliamentary secretary for her comments.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
The promotion of breast-feeding is an integral part of several Health Canada programs. 
This is an ongoing effort by Health Canada. 
It is one that we are working co-operatively with all of our partners. 
I applaud the member's efforts in raising this issue. 
We will continue to support these actions.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.02 p.m.)
