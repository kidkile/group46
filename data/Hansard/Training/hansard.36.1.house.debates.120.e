The House met at 9 a.m. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):
They had many meetings per day and per week. 
They worked very well with government members. 
We believe this report is the product of much co-operation.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
They were totally dedicated and I appreciated it.

PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
As parliamentarians know, the Board of Internal Economy is a very secretive operation. 
INTERNET CHILD PORNOGRAPHY PREVENTION ACT 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
I am presenting two petitions. 
One petition is regarding the abolition of nuclear weapons. 
The hon. member is not permitted to read the petition. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have 11 petitions. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is the last petition I have. 
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It concerns our police officers and firefighters.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Whenever that may be.  
That is an academic question. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary may wish to illumine us on that.  
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
I shall now put Motions Nos. 1 and 2 to the House.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ) moved: 
``An Act to amend the National Parks Act (creation of Tuktuk Nogait National Park)'' 
The purpose of the motion is just to change one letter in the title.  
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to make this change?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank you and I also thank the hon. members.  
The amendment only seeks to point out that the legislation refers to this park. 
This was followed by the act, which was also passed in 1984. 
Negotiations lasted a long time. 
Finally, in 1998, we will now pass the bill to create this park.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The Reform Party will be opposing that motion.  
The minister said that one of the greatest goals that exists- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Should the first and second motions not be debated?  
Bill C-38 will create a new national park. 
The creation of national parks is important. 
How will we manage to develop parks such as Tuktut Nogait? 
Without any new funds they expanded the habitat of the park. 
This was accomplished without using any new revenue. 
It was extremely clever. 
We need to learn from this experience.  
We can do that by generating revenues within the park.  
I will use Banff as an example.  
Banff has an ability to raise funds. 
This is exceedingly important to understand. 
They will be able to generate funds from that development. 
This would help our threatened flora and fauna. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am looking for a clarification. 
We are talking about the development of a new park. 
If we do not do that we will be in trouble.  
We are a major conduit. 
Poachers and traffickers of endangered species know this. 
Money is required to combat that. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
It should be all encompassing.  
This government should not have dragged its heels in the last few years. 
The community has made specific claims. 
I believe that the next motion will deal with the requests it has made.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party I support this motion. 
Therefore, I support the motion.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it agreed that we proceed and put the question on Motion No. 1?  
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
(Motion No. 1 agreed to) 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-38, in Clause 1, be amended 
(a) by adding after line 15 on page 2 the following: 
The amendment reads as follows: 
We have specified the boundaries.  
Why am I moving this amendment? 
I find myself in a rather difficult situation. 
It helped me understand some of the government's arguments.  
This was the agreement the government concluded with the Inuvialuit in 1984. 
That agreement was concluded in 1996. 
Caribou do not stay in one place. 
Restricting mining exploration is an excellent thing in itself. 
The government will probably proceed with the current boundaries. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
It is simply that. 
My third reason is economics. 
This process has been going on for 20 years. 
It has involved all parties. 
This is not contingent on the mining process moving forward. 
It was for no other reason than economics.  
The government simply cannot support this for the reasons mentioned. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
That was the intent and I sensed that from all members of the committee. 
An agreement is an agreement. 
There had been an agreement signed by all six parties involved. 
Not all six signatories wanted it reopened. 
Other members of the agreement might not be in favour of that. 
I see absolutely nothing wrong with that. 
This is another reason I have trouble in supporting this motion.  
I think that sets a dangerous precedent.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The anomaly inside the park is of prime mineral extraction.  
This agreement gives them first opportunity to gain access into that sort of industry.  
There is the question of adjusting the boundaries to gain access to minerals. 
I think that should be done. 
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
My colleague has talked about the government's position on this amendment. 
I begin by putting this bill in its proper context. 
The judiciary is one of the fundamental institutions of our democracy. 
It is for this very reason that we do not want popular judges. 
The supreme court gave the example of the federal commission.  
A judge who retires before 65 has no right to a pension at all. 
This is a situation that is increasingly considered unfair.  
Permitting this will be good for them and for the court itself as an institution.  
These are both common features of other pension plans.  
Terms would be renewed once on renomination.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
We have to ask 8.3% of what. 
It is of the base salary judges are making at this time. 
Is this the time to be doing this?  
Would it not be wonderful if we did that first? 
There is something wrong with this, and I just want to give some statistics.  
This task will not be left solely to the Minister of Justice. 
Did the Scott commission consider that? 
There is something wrong. 
I understand the need to attract the best in the legal community to the bench. 
Are they pleased to be taxed more? 
This is the wrong time.  
There is no question in my mind. 
The government has balanced the budget mainly on the backs of taxpayers. 
Let me give some statistics. 
First, the judges want more money. 
We spend more on taxes in Canada than we do on those three items. 
We are the highest taxed country in the G-7. 
I do not think that is right.  
How can we say to those folks that we know they are struggling?  
My constituency is facing a drought. 
They will have to sell off their herds. 
How can we do that? 
I cannot do that.  
We stand as the opposition to cry out against it. 
We just cannot do it. 
We represent everyone in our constituency, even those who voted against us. 
Some of them take home meagre pays.  
I have young twin sons who are in the labour force now. 
He had to pay with taxes and deductions almost $2,000. 
The bill is saying that Spencer Ramsay will be required to pay more. 
We can sell Stornoway.  
We could deal with that and we could deal with a lot of other things.  
Judges do a tough job and are required to interpret the law. 
Surely we can do that. 
As members of parliament, we should be able to do that as well.  
Yes, our judges need decent courts. 
They need decent facilities to function in, as we do. 
We are talking about our take home pay. 
How can we say that?  
We confuse the issue. 
We mix it up with legal jargon and we put it in a bill. 
We have a commission look at it. 
It makes its recommendations. 
We just say this is the recommendation by the commission. 
Its members have looked at it. 
We have assigned them and we have appointed them to do the job. 
We are going to take their recommendations and go forward. 
The bottom line always is where does the wealth come from.  
We must do it in a balanced and fair way. 
I do not think most of our judges are selfish people, not at all.  
I am sure they would say that.  
We are not involving them directly. 
I think the judges can as well.  
We cannot do that. 
That is the greatest threat. 
We are going to pass this and suffer the consequences. 
Not the judges and not the MPs. 
What are we getting to? 
We are saying that to the taxpayer.  
I cannot support the bill.  
In this area I want to touch on something that is extremely important. 
I say that is a grave decision because of what it means.  
We must maintain the taxation rate or increase it. 
That is an encroachment on the supremacy of this parliament in the area of taxation.  
Where is it going to stop? 
How do we stop it?  
How do we intervene? 
This bill does not intervene. 
This parliament is accepting and embracing it. 
We have not even looked at that aspect of it.  
It motivated the bill. 
That decision created the need for this bill.  
Are we prepared to accept an encroachment on our right of taxation? 
When we see the collapse of that then what are we going back to? 
Are we going to do that?  
I say that this bill is heading us in that direction. 
The warnings are there. 
Show me what I have not considered.  
I based my decisions upon them. 
If we are, what can we do about it?  
I have great concerns about the bill. 
Right now it is not fair.  
I hope I hear from some of my colleagues in the House. 
I respect their opinions and always have in this area. 
If we are, is it a good thing or a bad thing? 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
The supreme court acted on this request in its decision. 
That does not make sense.  
Let me digress for a moment. 
They have to fight with their employer, and the pay office. 
The government is not capable of competing with the lucrative private job market. 
That is one of the arguments that has been raised. 
I congratulate them on their excellent work.  
Yet, they do a great job.  
The Bloc Quebecois is not starting a war against the judges. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for you. 
Which is more important in society?  
Is this the way we should look at it? 
At some point, we have to stop and think. 
Is the increase too high? 
I think the government did not give it enough thought.  
It is retroactive to April 1997. 
Why should there be retroactive compensation for the salary freeze of recent years? 
That is the reason we are being given. 
Either it is retroactive, or it is not. 
In response to the minister, therefore, indexing would have been enough. 
But the government is giving more.  
Members also had their salaries frozen for five years.  
Why should we give judges special treatment? 
Whey should they be treated differently than other government professionals or salaried workers?  
Now. the government is making those same people pay for the judges' salary increases. 
I have already referred to transfer payments. 
Forty-some billion is a really big amount. 
The government is accusing us of failing to honour the Supreme Court decision. 
The Supreme Court said ``Set up an independent commission''. 
In closing, judges too, in my opinion, should make budget sacrifices. 
Judges also did their part. 
The government reduced its payroll by 6%.  
Why would it be any different here? 
It could not be stated more clearly. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I have indicated that in previous addresses to this House.  
The movement toward a unified family court is a good move. 
It provides a mechanism for the division of property for the judiciary.  
However, that amendment was not deemed important enough to be brought forward.  
Those are some of the good aspects of this legislation that are worthy of consideration. 
However, we could have expanded that committee. 
We could have included a member of the Canadian Bar Association. 
Some of the judiciary in this country are exemplary. 
Some go beyond the call of duty. 
They say they have no responsibility to make further inquiries. 
They have abandoned that work.  
The judiciary simply checks things off in the way a clerk might. 
The failure to expand the committee is a flaw in the bill.  
I see my hon. colleague from Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough in the House today. 
He and I walked a picket line in Halifax. 
I think our picture appeared on the front page of the daily news. 
They defend people who are charged with the most heinous crimes. 
The crown prosecutors prosecute those crimes to ensure justice is done. 
They have not had a pay increase. 
I refer to section 41 in the Judges Act. 
I find this most interesting especially at this point in time. 
As I have said I do not oppose that. 
You pay for your accommodations. 
If you can accomplish all of that, you can go''.  
So what are we doing? 
How does that advance the interests of justice?  
There are a few other important points to make. 
He and I have discussed the issue before.  
The check has to be more than the opposition of the government.  
Let us look at Bill C-37. 
They determine what the changes are to be in the legislation. 
It is presented to the House. 
There is an airing of different views. 
The opposition members may vote against it, but the legislation will pass.  
It will not be checked by the governor general. 
The judiciary does play an important role.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member says he cannot support this particular bill. 
The whole issue of judges pensions is very important. 
Those salaries need to be brought in line with today's world. 
This legislation goes a significant way in doing that.  
I would like to hear a little bit more from you on that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I apologize most sincerely and humbly. 
I would never want you to feel left out. 
I apologize most humbly.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Actually it is the Chair that is the integral part. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In some cases they are a substantial bar to appointing women to the bench.  
It does not go far enough.  
That is why I belong to it. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The most recent perhaps is the Feeney decision. 
Parliament has since come to grips with that issue. 
I think that is a very important balance that has to be struck. 
The timing is always questionable. 
Each and every time, sometimes reluctantly, the answer was yes. 
It was an important decision.  
I keep in mind some of the comments made by previous speakers about judges. 
That is one of the human qualities every judge has. 
We in this House have bad days too. 
It does not add anything to the debate.  
It happens far too often. 
That is what is important. 
We have to try to avoid that type of talk when we can.  
It is proportionate and we believe it is not a bad thing.  
The old expression that you get what you pay for does apply in this instance. 
These rules do not ensure in any certain way that the system will be perfect. 
A four year review seems like a reasonable period of time. 
New proposals may arise. 
New circumstances may come to light. 
A four year review process is a necessary step.  
It is a good suggestion and one that we would support. 
It would approve accountability and transparency. 
It improves input and the process itself is elevated as a result. 
I question whether that is happening to the extent that it could.  
There is a need to improve the situation of frontline police officers. 
However I believe this is a start. 
This reduces complexity and delay when its comes to the court. 
This is a problem that many encounter in the court system today.  
I see it as a positive step.  
These are areas that we should be focusing on. 
All these things are viewed positively by the Conservative Party.  
The Conservative Party does not have difficulty with that change.  
As a whole we support the bill. 
We are ready to support it because we believe it is a good thing. 
We are thankful for the opportunity to do so. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his excellent remarks.  
It is very much in the public interest that we do so. 
The issue is how far we go in giving discretion to judges. 
A perfect example is the whole concept of minimum sentences.  
This is question and comment period. 
It is now before the supreme court on a challenge. 
We must never hobble a judge's discretion to use his discretion. 
Could the member comment on that? 
We must give those judges that discretion.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his commentary. 
His remarks reflect a great deal of insight into this area.  
They exercise discretion daily. 
The scope, breadth and effect of decisions are sometimes staggering. 
Impaired driving legislation was another example that was cited by the hon. member. 
There is certainly a need for more discussion in this area. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
That impartiality is a two sided coin. 
Some of the judges in these provinces took exception to the process that was used. 
That process is in place. 
The court has said there must be a process. 
That process in part involves what previously was a three year commission. 
In this case it is the Government of Canada.  
Some provinces did not have this mechanism. 
We do have a process for federal judges. 
The changes are modest. 
I do not think that is what the supreme court said. 
I am quite sure all judges endorse that.  
This is not the case. 
I accept that it is not our goal to simply attract judges. 
We must attract the best available people, the best candidates to be judges. 
We have to make sure we have the best. 
To do anything other than that is penny wise and pound foolish. 
The judges are the focal point of that system. 
They are the fulcrum on which the whole system turns. 
If judges are not good at what they do our judicial system will suffer. 
We want to keep it that way.  
I must address the level of increase for judges. 
It was a rough benchmark. 
We have to make these judgments in this House. 
That is one of the highest levels of the deputy minister compensation package.  
Over the last few years the DM-3 level has gone up. 
There was some drift. 
Let us put on the record what the increase is. 
I did not buy it. 
It was not catch up for the salary lost through the freeze period.  
I am more comfortable with that now. 
He was indicating that a large dollar amount is involved. 
That is true for all Canadians, not just judges. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I find it very interesting that there is a double standard. 
It occurs to me that we are creating another double standard. 
Among other things, the commission recommended full transparency in MP compensation. 
It also recommended an increase in the housing allowance available to parliamentarians.  
We ought to follow the same guideline when it comes to our retirement allowances.  
Screw the Blais report''.  
The question is on Motion No. 2.

Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Even the Prime Minister has begun to recognize the need for change.

Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
I will share one of the verses with you: 
Once long ago a country wild, 
Oppressed by a conqueror 
Of courage far beyond the strength 
Of your unflinching majesty.  
Th'emboldened hand of ancestors 
Made you into their dwelling place 
And did create with strokes so sure 
Happy celebrations to all the people of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):

Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):

The government's efforts continue.  
Let us let that process continue. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The public says that it should look after every victim. 
Finally the victims are mounting this campaign for the long, hot summer.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There are other governments that have their own positions.  
Reform Party members are great champions of constituents. 
The hon. Minister of Health has the floor.  
I understand that Ralph Klein is a constituent of the Leader of the Opposition. 
Why will the Leader of the Opposition not do what Ralph Klein says? 
He is content with the process in place at the moment. 
Why will he not support his constituent on this?  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Why will he not do it?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Our productivity is up. 
The country is leading the G-7. 
Those are our fundamentals.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We will, I hope, be in a position to make an announcement shortly.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Perhaps they will teach him something.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We may want to pursue the idea of licence buybacks. 
We want economic development. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
The hon. the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are very much aware of the fact that these people are facing considerable uncertainty.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, ordinary measures and ordinary insensitivity as well.  
This is why we have to make structural changes to the economy.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
An independent report, however, points to an organization in crisis.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, perhaps when the New Democratic Party grows up it will learn to read. 
We do our job well. 
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The minister continues to refuse to recognize that there is a crisis. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the NDP is a little unpredictable. 
The next week it is breast implants and they are proven wrong. 
They ought to do their homework before they come to this House.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, here is a number. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
In January the NIS told Ann Margaret Dickey that the investigation was suspended. 
Yesterday in the House the Prime Minister said that the investigation was ongoing. 
In Halifax yesterday the National Investigation Service confirmed that the investigation is finished. 
However, the NIS in Ottawa said it is ongoing.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
They asked her to do it.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The Canadian forces have an excellent impartial mechanism in place to do just that.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
Consultations with the five provincial governments were successful. 
This is not true.  
I hope to soon be in a position to make an announcement.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is the reality.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the situation is extremely serious. 
We know these communities, and we are aware of the situation with the fisheries.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Dear colleagues, I would ask you to please listen to the replies.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
After three years, finally a statement was taken. 
They told her to get her own evidence.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
However, we are doing the responsible thing and respecting the integrity of the investigation. 
I would urge the member to do likewise.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the National Investigation Service is an independent organization. 
It was recommended by the Somalia inquiry as well.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the only contradiction is in the member's mind.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not what the House understood on Monday. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I do not know why the members are surprised. 
That is the way things have always been done.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
The GM plant in Boisbriand is in trouble. 
It is the only car manufacturing plant in Quebec. 
The jobs of thousands of workers are at stake. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
GM has the capacity to do very well- 
The hon. member for Durham.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to take immediate action. 
I would like to thank the industry community, the members of this House- 
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we thought softball was played only in baseball diamonds.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are so many points I would like to make. 
It is so obvious it applies to all. 
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
She knows this is impossible.  
When will they admit publicly that these demands cannot be met?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I absolutely deny what the hon. member is saying. 
They just do not get it.  
The people of British Columbia know that this can work. 
The people of British Columbia appreciate the approach we are taking. 
The hon. member for Qu'Appelle.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
The TD bank and the CIBC wish to merge. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We will check them all out.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I have been travelling the country extensively in the last couple of months. 
An increasing number of Canadians are in opposition to the mergers.  
There is growing opposition in his Liberal government backbench committee against the mergers as well. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I do intend to concentrate and think about it this summer.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
But within federal jurisdiction we have been taking a number of initiatives. 
The hon. member for Fundy-Royal.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We have not got access to all the legal documents. 
I can assure the House of this.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
His department now says no such agreement exists.  
How does the minister explain this contradiction?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
That is my job.  
They press or do not press charges.  
It has nothing to do with me. 
The hon. member should know this- 
The hon. member for Portneuf.  
BC MINE IN BLACK LAKE 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
The minister cannot have it both ways. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We said then and we repeat again that that is wrong.  
So the hon. member cannot have it both ways.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Yet these French islands have no salmon rivers. 
They are not contributing to the resource.  
And while he is on his feet- 
The hon. minister of fisheries.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We will now be discussing with the French. 
I often use the words ``call in the members''. 
Now I would like to call in the pages.  
HOUSE OF COMMONS PAGES 
Thank you for serving us so well.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The bad news is that it will be all by myself.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I believe that is Bill C-47.  
That motion when adopted would bring to a conclusion the spring portion of this session.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order arising out of question period. 
PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
As the commission so aptly put it: 
In fact, no one expects that. 
However, we are seriously lagging in this respect.  
The report is a reasonable response to a complex and even more sensitive issue. 
That is not a point of order, but does the hon. member have unanimous consent?  
Here are some of the key provisions of the bill. 
There are two key elements to the bill. 
This increase would apply to the sessional allowance and to all other allowances. 
I also believe that this is fair. 
This was recommendation by the Blais commission report.  
We should not always be guided solely by what the media have to say. 
However, you will permit me to read a few quotes.  
I will read other quotes.  
A 2% a year increase over four years is reasonable''.  
Last July the Blais commission was appointed. 
The committee reported on June 3. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Let me give some examples.  
All these issues are contained in this omnibus bill. 
It is quite inappropriate that we deal with it all in one.  
All these and more in one bill cover three other acts. 
I want to talk for a moment about the incidental expense allowance. 
All Canadian payroll income is taxable. 
Reform Party MPs feel no exception should be made for federal members of parliament. 
We do not support any proposal that will continue to hide taxable income. 
I want to talk a bit about MP salaries. 
We do not support the inclusion of this clause. 
It is ironic that such a clause ends up in legislation. 
It seems they have been asking us. 
I will address that in a few minutes. 
They have time to think about that.  
It has been reported that Reform is opting in. 
Such comments have been made by groups like the national citizens coalition. 
I have had a fair bit of experience in designing pension plans. 
I am going to quote that policy to the House: 
I provided a calculation in my notes, but I will not go through it here.  
Some of this could be taxable to members of this House. 
I congratulate my colleagues in obtaining what they were looking for in the first place. 
I also congratulate them for having the stamina to stay with it.  
All of this is within the Income Tax Act. 
That report eliminated the gold plated legislative pension plan for MLAs. 
I do not think so. 
In the meantime, 38 Reform MPs have a difficult option.  
That is all I have to say regarding the pension. 
I would like to talk a bit about Senate remuneration. 
The Blais commission report recommended changes to Senate salaries. 
A better process must be put in place.  
We came to Ottawa. 
We opted out of the gold plated pension plan. 
Until then we will work toward something better.  
Finally, I want to address one other issue that has come up recently. 
Votes on division are commonplace in this institution. 
It is not perfect and perhaps it needs change. 
But then again, I am not government. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill. 
First, we oppose the 2% salary increase. 
Let me be clear. 
The Bloc feels that the increase is justified. 
First of all, we were aware of the pay situation before we came here. 
We accepted those conditions because we were coming here in a very specific context. 
We knew we were not here for very long. 
The bill will correct this.  
That was an important change made to the act in 1994. 
He has no other job. 
So he will receive a six months' severance package. 
That was a mistake, in my opinion.  
I consider that basic justice.  
What will be the amount of this premium? 
This bill also contains provisions applying to the Senate. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Surely it is an opportunity for us to be overly critical of each other. 
Some of my colleagues in the Reform Party have experienced that over the last while. 
I say welcome to the club. 
I am only objecting to the things that are said about it which are untrue.  
There is no good time to do this. 
That brings me to the question of process. 
I think we should be lifted out of this situation.  
That is not an independent review. 
Former members of parliament are appointed to review the pay of members of parliament. 
That has been the longstanding recommendation of the New Democratic Party.  
That is up to individual members and we leave it at that. 
It did not affect any of our members in any way whatsoever.  
I do not think that is quite an accurate way to describe it. 
No parties opted out of the plan. 
The Reform Party has more than any other party. 
The Liberals and the Bloc have a few. 
I have been here before when I once opposed a raise. 
That is not an option that is before us today. 
We have before us the option of dealing with the legislation today. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The hon. member has said he would defend that position. 
I would agree with that and the Progressive Conservative Party takes that stance.  
However, it is an issue of timing. 
Every individual member is going to be forced to have a gut check. 
We find ourselves in the position of not supporting it wholeheartedly.  
I hope a lesson was learned in all this. 
A lesson in process may have been absorbed. 
The hypocrisy is there for all to see. 
Those will be the glaring remarks in the editorials.  
There is no option. 
That is an individual choice every member is going to be forced to make.  
Canadians can then judge for themselves what members have earned their pay. 
Those results will no doubt be seen at the time of the next general election.  
We also did not feel it was a priority at this time.  
Accordingly, this bill stands referred to committee of the whole.  
(Clauses 1 to 5 agreed to) 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, initially the clause in question was drafted somewhat differently. 
Both systems are parallel.  
The difference is the following. 
In receiving the benefits there are adjustment periodically. 
Arguably that is a form of interest.  
How does one establish the rate? 
Is he aware of that figure at the moment?  
At the present time it is in the area of 5%.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
It is not a level playing field. 
There could be at least 12 different kinds across the country. 
Each one of us generally pays taxes in the province in which we live. 
Some of us in this Chamber represent very large rural ridings. 
He is one of them. 
Those members already make a larger salary. 
That brought the following proposition to the minds of many. 
As I said previously, we still have a number of people with different incomes. 
Naturally, the benefit comes later because I get a pension. 
The reverse is also true.  
Those are the various salaries that exist now. 
It is going to be true with several different kinds of retirement plans. 
Mr. Chairman, we are almost there, but not quite. 
We talked about tax rates in different provinces. 
However, I am specifically referring to clause 6, the severance allowance which is being offered. 
It is an actuarial requirement. 
It is actuarially required that every employee participate in the same plan. 
I would like to put it to the minister again. 
By definition, the tenure here is different for everybody. 
We are obviously subject to the democratic rule. 
There is a whole variety of these things at any time. 
This is not a conventional employer, nor are we conventional employees. 
That is the difference.  
Comparable to the private sector is an interesting thought. 
What about executives in the private sector?  
However, I do not believe it is.  
I read from page 139 of the Blais commission report which states: 
That is from the Blais commission report.  
Other plans are not like that.  
Some would argue that the superannuation plan has a second component which has that feature. 
But generally it does not. 
That is true of public sector plans.  
Should everyone be in the plan? 
That is my position. 
I refuse to participate in that dialogue. 
I have to be consistent with what I said.  
I do not think it is wrong. 
I think it is right. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, here we are getting into an area that is a little complicated. 
For MPs who are in the plan, we had a difficulty. 
Therefore, they would no longer qualify for the severance. 
At that time a companion change should have been made to the severance.  
I believe that answers that scenario. 
I do not know if there are any other scenarios possible. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, I have a comment and then a question. 
That is not unusual even in the private sector. 
Is it the intention of the government to do that at some point or not?  
I would like that confirmed.  
Hon. Don Boudria L:
Mr. Chairman, that is precisely it. 
That is basically where the idea came from. 
I reason it to be very similar.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I have never denied the fact that contributions are paid and that they are substantial.  
She furthermore said that the government should ``screw the Blais report''.  
Mr. Chairman, I think there are basically three questions in there. 
It is a pension. 
But we have to make that assumption because most investments do bring in income.  
Some of the largest owners of shares in banks today are pension plans. 
I will not do so. 
I think this package is reasonable overall. 
I will not take part in that.  
I am against the issue of binding recommendation. 
That is wrong in my opinion. 
I am going to St. Isidore de Prescott in my riding this weekend. 
It is called accountability. 
Not my fault is not my way of doing things. 
Eventually I will be judged for what I do. 
But I will not chicken out. 
I will never say that it is not my fault.  
(Clauses 6 to 16 inclusive agreed to) 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Again I thank them. 
I believe they did a good job.  
Yes, I have learned the truth. 
This is what I believe.  
I met him on many occasions as a staffer on the Hill. 
I believe that to be true.  
A doctor should be able to be a MP. 
People from the agricultural community should be MPs. 
Every Canadian should be able to aspire to come here. 
That is a principle of democracy.  
One of my pet hobbies is the study of history. 
Not enough people in Britain had the right to vote. 
A second thing was wrong at the time. 
No one else could. 
Members of parliament were not paid.  
That is not right. 
Both those propositions are wrong.  
I will do that because I believe that it is right. 
I recommend the bill to the House of Commons.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Before we resume the debate I have a couple of announcements to make.  
His illness was a figment of imagination.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I must say I am a bit at a loss. 
I thought we had interpretation here for everybody. 
The notice was read in English and French.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That was one of them.  
Mr. Speaker, that was well done.  
I think all of us in the House understand that.  
I think they had better keep peace over there.  
I want to talk about the current MP pension plan. 
There were some changes relevant to that plan in 1994. 
There have to be some rules for that as well. 
That is the fourth kind. 
That is different from the other plan.  
We have five situations. 
It is such a convoluted exercise that something must be done. 
It will not go away. 
It is true we have established something here today. 
That is exactly where we are headed.  
I think it is a natural process to go through. 
We accept that on this side. 
We need something reasonable. 
They are sitting here hoping that there is some agreement ultimately to change this plan. 
They are embarrassed by being in it.  
Ultimately something has to give. 
That is our position. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
She put the reasons very clearly.  
There is therefore no need to throw good money after bad.  
The Bloc's opposition to this bill is real. 
My colleague made this point earlier very well. 
I have two quotes from Mr. Gravel: 
He concluded by saying: 
I was saying, at the beginning of my speech, that this opposition is real. 
Mr. Gravel's quote, however, refers to something else. 
I find Mr. Gravel's allusion rather insidious. 
Reference was also made to a minority report by the parties in opposition. 
He writes, and I quote: 
The same goes for the pension plan. 
We also agree with the provision regarding the departure allowance. 
We are therefore in favour of this allowance.  
I think I have made that clear today.  
Consequently, in our opinion, there is no need to change it.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
As I said earlier, this is a difficult thing. 
I wish it did not go with the territory. 
We would then have another category.  
I do not think we should be against complexity in principle. 
I think that where fairness demands complexity then complexity it is. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Bill C-31, an act respecting Canada Lands Surveyors-Chapter 14.  
Bill C-411, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act-Chapter 18.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is a bill that is of importance to all parties in the House. 
It would just require a minute or so of House time.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
(Motion agreed to, amendments read the second time and concurred in) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is actually quite a simple issue. 
Frankly, I am appalled that such gaps were allowed to exist in the first place. 
This constituent described their situation as a vicious circle of high cost and low returns.  
Unlike the more established farmers, they do not have something to fall back on. 
That may be a harsh statement, but that is not an exaggeration. 
If that is not discrimination I do not know what is.  
We can think of many other examples. 
I could go on and on with different examples where that discrimination exists.  
I am not terribly optimistic that will happen. 
I think the reaction from the other side of the House was an insult. 
This put the farmer in real financial hardship. 
He was unable to meet his commitment to the Farm Credit Corporation.  
The hon. member could not have said it better.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Thus the amendment is inconsistent with the current tax policy in this area.  
Some of these amounts should perhaps qualify for tax relief but others decidedly should not. 
But for the purposes of tax law this does not suffice. 
I thank the hon. member for bringing this issue forward. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
I believe they have been in place for 28 years. 
The program provides assistance when disaster strikes. 
In addition, there were problems with the definition of farmer for purposes of compensation. 
The support has declined drastically throughout this decade. 
I just want to give a little bit of history to back up the point.  
I am sure this will not go unnoticed by farmers in my province.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
This bill is an effort to provide equality and fairness for farmers.  
They were aimed at boosting farm income.  
I would suggest that this is where the problem lies.  
There must be consistency in determining the level of assistance. 
It should not simply be based on the amount of publicity a natural disaster gets. 
This consistency must be applied to circumstances from coast to coast. 
Ad hoc programs provide for ad hoc solutions.  
One member would be nominated by each provincial agriculture minister. 
That being said, the PC Party will support this bill. 
Unfortunately, Bill C-227 is not votable. 
This bill clearly shows that there is a much larger problem. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I expected the response that I received from the government. 
Nonetheless, I am still very disappointed with it. 
We can always find ways around the issue. 
We can always find flaws in the bill. 
My intention was to raise the issue of fairness and equality.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does he have unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I emphasize here it is still at first reading; it has not been picked. 
I would hope the debate would deal with the good points of the bill.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the House give it unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed to the late show?  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
He goes on to add: 
These are clear and precise questions. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.26 p.m.)
