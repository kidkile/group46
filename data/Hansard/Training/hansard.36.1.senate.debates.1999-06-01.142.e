Tuesday, June 1, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Honorary Doctorate from University of Montreal 
As far as he is concerned, this is the eleventh commandment. 
His life is testimony to his deep thinking.  
His task is not an easy one. 
In my opinion, sending this great writer on such a mission is a good idea. 
We wish him the best of luck in his undertaking.  
Negative Effects of Free Trade Agreements 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
All of this would happen without the client's knowledge or explicit consent.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Notice of Motion of Affirmation and Resolution in Support of Entitlements 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Prime Minister's Office 
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
There are serious issues at stake here, honourable senators. 
These issues go to the heart of public accountability and public confidence. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I take the senator's question very seriously. 
However, the charges are simply false. 
I repeat, that is false.  
How do you know?  
Since then, he has not had any financial interest in that company whatsoever.  
We have an ethics commissioner who does not answer to Parliament or the public. 
These include contracts during the government's term in office.  
Seven companies were eligible and submissions were made in the normal course of events.  
Those are the facts of the matter.  
Honourable senators, I have a further supplementary question. 
There were seven companies originally. 
Shipbuilding-Development of National Policy-Government Position 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Several government departments and agencies are working on behalf of shipbuilders in this regard. 
There are several procurement projects planned to start in the 1999-2000 fiscal year. 
The leader has referred to fiscal 1999-2000, but we have not seen anything yet. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
It is my understanding that the Chaplain General is due to retire shortly. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Comeau has raised those concerns on several occasions. 
I indicated that the Chaplain General had made a decision. 
I should like the minister to at least consider that part. 
They were indeed moving.  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
To that end, Canadians will be the first into battle and the last out. 
Has there been an apology? 
Does the government know why Canada was excluded? 
Was the exclusion made on a need-to-know basis? 
Just what was the reason we were excluded?  
If the minister has anything further to add, I should be pleased to hear it.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
At the same time, there are other actions on the diplomatic front. 
Some 200 crewmen are aboard the Athabaskan , which is now in the Adriatic. 
If it has not arrived, it is about to arrive at its destination.  
Honourable senators, I agree with Honourable Senator Forrestall. 
It has happened once that we were not invited or informed of a certain meeting. 
I certainly hope it does not happen again.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer would be yes, very much in the affirmative. 
We would refuse to cooperate.  
It is not Canada's intention to be involved with the KLA.  
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
It is apparent that the Milosevic regime is on the ropes. 
The man himself has been indicted. 
Last night, more civilians were killed in bombing raids. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the decision has been taken by all of the NATO allies. 
It has been determined, unfortunately, that the bombing must continue.  
At the same time, efforts are going forward on the diplomatic front. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
I hear of delegations going down to Texas to save Stanley Faulder. 
Paul Bernardo goes on living. 
Why have we not taken a firmer stand? 
Honourable senators, that would be a subject for another debate. 
We have had very few cases of unintended strikes against civilians.  
However, he still has not answered the question of how we reconcile these various standards.  
I am not being confrontational, honourable senators. 
Honourable senators, this is a very difficult situation.  
Canada-United States Relations 
There was a possibility of a trade dispute with the United States.  
Mr. Axworthy responded that some progress had been made. 
A deadline had been set for reviewing the issues. 
I have information here from Allied Signal of Canada Inc., which gives the following example: 
These are problems we can solve. 
Might the minister have some progress or interesting developments to report?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Minister Axworthy has raised this question on several occasions with Madam Albright. 
Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters Canada- Message from Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
She is originally from Dorval, in Quebec. 
Adrienne Jarabek is studying in the Faculty of Administration at the University of Ottawa. 
She is enrolled in the Public Policy and Management Co-op Program. 
Adrienne is from London, Ontario.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I hope your stay with us will be both pleasant and instructive.  
Income Tax Amendments Bill, 1998 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does no other honourable senator wish to speak on this matter?  
Honourable senators, I wish to speak to this matter tomorrow.  
On motion of Senator Tkachuk, debate adjourned.  
Miscellaneous Statute LaW Amendment Proposals 
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, it is normal practice that the report be adopted by the Senate.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of the report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Bill 
Consideration of Report of Committee-Point of Order-Speaker's Ruling Reserved 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
It can be found in two different parts of the bill. 
Thus, the prohibition is clear. 
There are many places to which we can look. 
It would not prohibit sales of advertising services directed at other markets.  
Further on, he stated: 
It will put in place tough, appropriate penalties for foreign publishers who contravene the act.  
Whether it is 1 per cent or 99 per cent, the principle is still violated. 
Speaking of Bill C-55 she stated: 
These amendments, then, also imply an unknown tax expenditure. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do any other honourable senators wish to speak to the point of order?  
Paragraph 688 provides as follows: 
We believe it strikes a more even balance between the various stakeholders.  
Fortunately, Beauchesne's provides the answer at paragraph 689(3), where it states: 
The long title of the Bill C-55 reads as follows: 
An Act respecting advertising services supplied by foreign periodical publishers.  
Clause 21.1 provides for a de minimis exception. 
It also allows limited access to Canadian advertising revenues by foreign magazines. 
It allows the government to define advertising revenues for the purposes of this act.  
Beauchesne's, at paragraph 689.(2), 
The committee is proposing much less than this with these amendments. 
Not a single clause is being removed. 
In fact, not a single word is being struck out. 
The propose amendments fine-tune the bill. 
He said, on March 18 of this year: 
That is the principle behind the bill.  
She said, on October 22, 1998: 
What has changed is the precise details of how it will be advanced. 
It is out of order to make changes to those details. 
Recently, we had the proposed amendments to the extradition bill. 
It was attempting to modify the details.  
The Senate has a long history of proposing substantive amendments to legislation. 
Many more such examples exist. 
I wish to thank the honourable senator for his question. 
I hope I understood it correctly.  
New clause 21.1 sets out a de minimis exception for certain foreign publishers. 
This exception is, therefore, of limited application.  
Finally, this exception is time specific. 
The regime will continue to apply to the vast majority of foreign publishers. 
Therefore, they do not undermine the main principles of the legislation.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We operate as an independent, separate house of Parliament, a legislature.  
Our role is that of the legislative process. 
We must jealously guard our procedures. 
On this matter, reference has been made to some of the procedural literature. 
I wish to draw attention to Erskine May and Beauchesne. 
It is found at the bottom of page 525: 
Honourable senators, listen carefully to what Bourinot tells us: 
There is a footnote to that. 
I would urge His Honour to refer to 251 E. Hans. 
Senator Murray has just alluded to that. 
The operative paragraph is clause 3(1): 
No foreign publisher shall supply advertising services...  
That is the principle of the bill.  
We were concerned about the purpose clause. 
We must look at what it is that is modifying the freedom. 
It is the prohibition. 
The law will prohibit and interfere with freedom. 
That is clause 3(1) of the bill.  
The new subclause 21.1, honourable senators, is saying just the opposite. 
It says that foreign publishers are not prohibited. 
Clause 21.1 states that this act does not apply to a foreign publisher. 
Is that not a contradiction? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, Senator Poulin had risen on a point of order. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The title does not indicate a negative or a positive. 
Honourable senators, this bill is clear. 
It was clear in its first proposal. 
There have been significant amendments. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do any honourable senators who have not yet spoken wish to participate?  
If not, we will hear Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton.  
That is on the public record. 
I have no objection to that whatsoever.  
The advertisers, on the other hand, gleefully accepted the amendments. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a brief point to make. 
The thrust of the bill was not to prevent all split-run publications. 
The thrust was to limit split-run publications in the Canadian market.  
Honourable senators, we are getting somewhat into an analysis of the bill. 
It is a contradiction.  
Let us be very clear about this:
I believe that the publishers were consulted about the policy. 
The publishers did not condemn the bill. 
They expressed concern about the amendments. 
Senator Poulin mentioned the magazine fund. 
The amendments and the magazine fund are inseparable. 
Surely we have a right to know how much money is involved. 
This is a pseudo "money bill." 
We can pass the bill without any reference to subsidies. 
One is not dependent upon the other.  
The minister, in her testimony before the committee yesterday, said: 
The Senate is being asked to consider these changes...and 
There are two other parts of this week's package...  
In the result, we are proposing amendments to this bill.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thank His Honour for that guidance.  
I refer His Honour to page 524 of Bourinot, upon which I have been relying. 
Others have been relying upon Beauchesne and Erskine May. 
At page 524, Bourinot's Parliamentary Procedure, Fourth Edition states: 
The matter is very problematic from that standpoint as well.  
That is exactly what Bill C-55 would do. 
With the proposed amendments, it will no longer have that prohibition.  
With the proposed amendments, it will no longer have that guarantee.  
Senator Graham also said: 
Finally, in answer to a question, Senator Graham said: 
Honourable senators, listen carefully. 
That is the principle behind the bill.  
That preservation is gone. 
The principle has been shattered.  
Honourable senators, reference was made by Senator Kinsella to the package. 
We are dealing with a bill, not with a package. 
There is no such provision.  
What are we to think? 
Now we have Minister Graham with another view.  
It was her testimony that this is part of a package. 
She happens to be the minister sponsoring the bill. 
Surely the sponsoring minister knows more about the bill than we do. 
This is why we are there listening to her. 
We take her at her word. 
This was a package.  
Honourable senators, I am the sponsoring minister in this place. 
You do not support the amendments, then.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
I commend our colleague the Honourable Senator Lavoie-Roux for introducing this important legislation. 
I must say that it is long overdue. 
Being on that committee was an emotional experience. 
We all felt keenly the tremendous responsibility that we had been given. 
We took our task seriously. 
We applied ourselves with vigour to the challenge that came with our mandate. 
There is no question here of reopening that particular debate.  
Bill S-29 seeks to chart those waters. 
Action has never been needed as much as right now. 
Bill S-29 itself is straightforward. 
There will be a great deal of input into the process.  
The legislation itself is pretty simple, but its implications are nothing short of enormous. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Bills to Amend-Second Readings-Debate Continued 
And on the Order: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
That legislation introduced two changes with respect to voting hours. 
I mention that merely for the record.  
It is my understanding that such a bill will be introduced very soon.  
Bill to Amend-Consideration of Report of Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
However, let us not go too fast or be too judgmental. 
I wish to support Bill S-10 in two ways. 
Reading is a gift, and one that those who enjoy can give to others. 
Before writing, the world was filled with darkness. 
Writing brought light and hope. 
That boundary was thousands of years ago. 
Let me start with what I regard as the flippant opposition to the bill. 
Most often, the argument is not made quite so harshly. 
After all, their education requires that they be tactful. 
Let us look at that argument. 
There are many arrows in the quiver, and all should be tried. 
There are two answers to this. 
This argument hinges on the meaning of "literacy." 
There are levels of proficiency in reading. 
The results for Canada show real cause for concern. 
Canada has almost universal literacy. 
Canadians must read well. 
In other words, we get Canadians to read more. 
This is the obvious way to improve any skill.  
We can see where Bill S-10 fits in. 
The GST is only 7 per cent. 
There are several answers to this. 
We can all agree on the benefits of being able to read. 
Let us now look at some of the other objections to Bill S-10.  
Most of these objections can be described as economic. 
Let us begin with the cost. 
Is Bill S-10 too costly? 
Neither estimate is minor and both admit to qualifications.  
Any adjustment to existing legislation introduces complexity into the system. 
It is always easy to assert that the change will introduce too much complexity. 
Mention was made of home heating fuels and children's clothing. 
We know that and the Department of Finance knows that. 
The reason is quite simple. 
There are several reasons for that. 
The result is that the translated books cost more than the originals. 
Publishers of French-language books do not benefit from the economies of scale.  
We hope to have good news from you shortly.  
I have examined the costs and the benefits of Bill S-10. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Report of Special Committee Adopted as Amended 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
Honourable senators, it is my understanding that I can speak at this point. 
Honourable senators, I should like to move adoption of the report as amended. 
First, however, I should like a chance to explain.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am in agreement with the proposal.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
I take it in stride. 
Therefore, I subscribe to Senator Kelly's proposal.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It was moved by the Honourable Senator Kelly, seconded by the Honourable Senator Pepin: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Security Incident at Vancouver APEC Conference 
Motion to Establish Special Committee-Debate Continued 
I have been waiting for many months to get this speech off my chest. 
I prepared notes for a speech over the Christmas holidays, as a matter of fact. 
Two issues, in particular, are of concern to me, even as a layman. 
I refer to the Minister of Justice and to the Solicitor General. 
Fortunately, the Senate stopped the exercise.  
Even so, I remain astonished that such a bill emerged from the cabinet process. 
They went along all too easily with an abuse of political power by the government. 
Happily, the bill was killed in the Senate.  
That commission was presided over by a sitting judge of the Federal Court of Canada. 
One of its members was a former Superior Court judge. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, order, please. 
Honourable senators, the system is failing us. 
Today, the game is to provide cover for ministers and high officials. 
People chosen to serve in high office derive many satisfactions from the experience. 
In return, they are supposed to set high professional standards. 
The role of political staff is essentially partisan. 
RCMP investigators were trading rumours with author Stevie Cameron. 
Obviously, information was being divulged to unauthorized people. 
Is this the way we wish to see justice done in Canada in the future?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed?  
Who is looking after that? 
How could this have happened?  
In the case of the justice portfolios, the dangers are most acute. 
Governments change; policies change. 
Now they are telling the police to enforce the law like a speeding ticket. 
To paraphrase a distinguished Canadian, the criminal law is not a general store.  
As we know, the end does not justify the means. 
Do not underestimate the power of bad precedent. 
It is a sure-fire incitement to new abuses of authority. 
That is almost always sufficient argument for the hesitant to overcome their scruples.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this matter will remain standing in the name of the Honourable Senator Carstairs.  
Status of Palliative Care 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
There will likely be many new advances in the field in the next twenty years. 
Palliative care is not a priority for three reasons. 
"Nobody will talk about it," she complained.  
Since that time, 5,000 copies of the standards have been distributed throughout Canada. 
Eight key research areas were identified by the Canadian Palliative Care Association. 
It is existential and spiritual concerns.  
That is only one area out of eight that is in need of research.  
Biomedical research is very different from palliative care research, for example. 
On motion of Senator Corbin, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin , having given notice on Thursday, March 18, 1999: 
There are four main parts to my remarks. 
In speaking of Africa, should we use the singular or the plural? 
Is there one Africa or are there Africas? 
How do Africans refer to themselves?  
There were the colonial and post-colonial eras and now, we have the present.  
I personally have had some very good experiences. 
But what proud people, and how hungry they are for justice.  
And yet, Africa is so full of promise. 
We need look no further than our own backyard.  
There is a population explosion in Africa. 
Fifty per cent of Mali's population is under 15 years of age. 
Niger is the poorest country, but it is also one with the highest birth rate. 
Who cares about that in Canada?  
In some cases it is better, while in others it is worse. 
In others still, it is absolutely outrageous.  
Africa is decidedly not an easy continent to understand. 
We can say what I have heard many times with my own ears: 
That is the way it is, that is the way they are. 
There is nothing we can do done about it, so why let it bother us?  
Yet I wish to believe that another Africa is emerging.  
For Africa has another face as well. 
There is much good will. 
There have even been some remarkable successes. 
Africa is still seeking its own democratic formulas. 
Because, for him, and I quote him again: 
I will focus more on Canada's relations with Africa.  
This institution had recently undergone a sweeping change. 
Canadians were directly involved in it, with positive results. 
They are models of integrity and indefatigable devotion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry to interrupt you, but your 15 minutes are up. 
Is leave granted to allow Senator Corbin to continue his speech?  
This was the point Ms Marleau made, and I quote: 
Corruption is a crucial topic; it must be addressed. 
We must talk together in the hope of stamping it out.  
Africa must learn to help itself, to stamp out corruption itself. 
As Ms Marleau said, and I quote: 
Ms Marleau was very firm when she said: 
This is encouraging news. 
Other countries have lost patience with many underdeveloped countries. 
The relative level of spending on defence were also taken into account. 
This is not what Canada wants.  
It is up to us to insist. 
I hope her remarks generate much comment in Africa.  
Thank you, Senator Molgat.  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, I move that debate be adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
On motion of Senator Comeau, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, June 2, 1999 at 1:30 p.m.
