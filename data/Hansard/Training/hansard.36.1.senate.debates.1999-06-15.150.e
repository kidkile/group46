Tuesday, June 15, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Violence on Television and in Movies 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Effects of Genetic Engineering 
Hon. Richard H. Kroft :
Science is entering new frontiers that are, frankly, unbelievable. 
So, again, science and technology have dealt us a contradiction. 
Science will go on. 
New frontiers will be opened and wonderful things will be made to happen. 
Access for the Disabled 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Other senators showed a keen interest.  
They have struck a working group of senior managers from the Senate. 
The Late Heward Stikeman, Q.C., O.C 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
He became the outstanding specialist in income tax. 
His career holds special significance to the Senate. 
Heward was the author of numerous texts and articles on the tax system. 
I can attest to his curious, probing, exacting and quicksilver type mind. 
In the process, the staid Canadian business leadership turned its attention outward to the globe. 
This is a deficit in popular thinking. 
Heward always argued for simpler, fairer tax rules. 
Honourable senators, Heward's work goes on.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I draw your attention to some distinguished visitors in our gallery. 
International Day in Support of Victims of Torture 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
A refugee known to my Toronto colleagues is a victim of torture. 
He is caught in a Catch-22 situation. 
It is required that he rehabilitate himself in order to get work. 
In other words, he must pass tests to get his family admitted. 
Cape Breton as Suggested Location of New Agency 
By all accounts, these investments of public and private funds have been crowned with success. 
However, that crucial commodity - political will - carried the day. 
Will Prime Minister Chretien now do as much for the people of Cape Breton?  
Interpretation of Historical Facts 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
So this is a first ambiguity among Canadians.  
The second is the Canadian flag. 
We French Canadians in Quebec had always wanted a distinctive Canadian flag. 
The controversy in this morning's newspapers goes beyond these misunderstandings. 
I do not turn on my friends. 
My friend Jean Chretien seems to be embroiled in a huge controversy. 
So we end up in another huge controversy. 
You should have heard the open-line shows this morning and even the television. 
Public Sector Pension Investment Board Bill 
Report of Committee Presented and Printed as Appendix 
Tuesday, June 15, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Sixth Report of Committee Presented and Printed as Appendix 
Tuesday, June 15, 1999 
The Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations has the honour to present its 
("A" presented only for the Senate) 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
One Hundred First Conference Held in Brussels, Belgium-Report of Canadian Group Tabled 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Access to Census Information 
This would begin with 1906 census records being released immediately. 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I would remind Honourable Senator Meighen that the motion was passed on division. 
With respect to this motion, there has not been a specific response, as yet.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Possible Meeting on Friday, June 11, 1999 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Prudence of Budget Allocations-Application of Surplus-Government Position 
The Royal Bank's economist John McCallum calls it prudence by stealth. 
Would the Leader of the Government in the Senate care to respond?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the government is living up to that commitment.  
Could the leader provide details regarding how the government is living up to that promise?  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Loss of Disposable Income as a Result of Taxation-Government Position 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on May 4, 1999) 
As family income rises, of course, these benefits are reduced.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Ethel Cochrane on May 13, 1999) 
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Matthew Archibald is studying at the University of Ottawa in the Faculty of Administration. 
His major is public policy. 
Matthew is from Sydney, Nova Scotia, or should I say Cape Breton?  
Matthew and Annick, I welcome you to the Senate. 
We hope that your week with us will be productive and interesting.  
Appropriation Bill No. 2, 1999-2000 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Miscellaneous Statute Law Amendment Bill, 1999 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does any other honourable senator wish to speak? 
If not, is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the best place in which to continue this debate would be in committee. 
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Ninth Report of Committee Reviewed-Debate Continued 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
On motion of Senator Simard, for Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Involvement in Yugoslavia-Relationship to International Law-Inquiry-Debate Suspended 
The Kosovo war was fundamentally about the rule of law. 
I am in profound disagreement with this viewpoint. 
Pope John Paul II deplored the human suffering caused by the bombing. 
Here in Canada, James Bissett, former Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia, said: 
Honourable senators, let us consider for a moment what actually happened. 
There were 13,000 civilian casualties, including 2,500 dead. 
NATO persisted in the bombing because the credibility of NATO itself had become an issue.  
New arms races are underway.  
Honourable senators, it has been said that NATO action was a "just war." 
However, two of the requirements for a "just war" are limitation and proportionality. 
Killing and damage, as Kosovo showed, are now indiscriminate. 
When the bombing started, 45,000 Kosovar refugees fled. 
After the strikes began, the number of refugees swelled to 855,000. 
Bombing worsened their situation.  
Of course something had to be done. 
We lost sight of that basic fact yesterday. 
Thank God for the United Nations. 
Canada is still trying to balance its adherence to both the UN and NATO. 
Canada is caught in a dilemma. 
Of course, the other NATO members did the same thing. 
They all subverted international law by war.  
However, their need, relative to the overwhelming U.S. strength, was marginal. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, mention was made of questions and answers. 
May we understand clearly what is being proposed?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Anyway, according to the rules, comments and questions.  
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
The provinces took a long time to comply with this provision. 
They lack credible statistics.  
This situation is not new. 
The situation immediately improved. 
But what about the offer? 
This is where we have a problem. 
It goes without saying that the number of anglophone students is much higher.  
Access to education in one's mother tongue is essential.  
More than ever, the government is showing its will to act. 
So there is a lack of coordination. 
Montfort Hospital was in the limelight for several weeks. 
The issue is now before the courts. 
No more, but no less. 
Education was for a number of years our community's main concern. 
Now, it is health. 
We either believe in it or we do not. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Rivest, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We are aware of his health, and it was a courtesy we owed to him.  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Involvement in Yugoslavia-Relationship to International Law-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Therefore, this country continues to try to balance both sets of obligations.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Will Senator Roche help me by answering a few questions?  
Senator Roche referred to the Security Council's resolutions on Yugoslavia. 
I will not attempt to read the mind of the U.S. administration. 
The U.S. administration is listening to those voices today.  
I did not hear words that seemed to me to answer the question.  
NATO was determined that it was going to run the show in Kosovo. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
How could NATO not be ready for everything? 
How could they not know that the Russians would move in first?  
Third, I applaud the arrival of Russian forces in advance of NATO. 
I thank the honourable senator for that question. 
He was clearly throwing the ball back to his political masters.  
I suppose that he will probably have much company in that applause. 
However, I suspect that a couple of heads will roll in light of these events.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the honourable senator. 
There are two ways that one can control a corporation or a government. 
Which solution is the senator recommending?  
I certainly was not recommending a partition process in Kosovo. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Therefore, my short answer to the Honourable Senator Grafstein is "yes."  
The very words "just cause" bring to mind the idea of a "just war." 
Thus, the answer to the question is clear:
The United Nations Security Council has the authority to legitimate force.  
He has mentioned that with respect to human rights.  
Article 2 of the Charter states, in part: 
Therefore, the non-proliferation treaty has the same function and role as the UN Charter. 
Yes, it has been superseded.  
I wish to return to the UN Charter for a moment. 
The word "refrain" does not mean "prohibit," it means "avoid." 
That is the only way you will get global support.  
Many hours were spent in trying to develop a resolution. 
The Russians would not agree to such a resolution. 
They would not agree to force. 
It refused to budge. 
Senator Grafstein is returning the argument to his basic convention. 
It is simply not in a position today to match NATO's strength. 
We must have a little more understanding of what is really going on in Russia. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We are in this very special position in these days. 
I thank the Honourable Senator Kinsella for his question. 
Is this what we have opened up? 
Honourable senators, Senator Kinsella has very effectively answered his own question. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
International Position in Communications 
Leave having been given to revert to Reports of Committees: 
Consideration of Report of Transport and Communications Committee-Debate Continued 
The whole title is "Wired to Win! 
Canada's Positioning Within The World's Technological Revolution."  
This report has been a work in progress for more than three years. 
For good or ill, that is for another debate. 
The committee wrestled with the question of what constitutes culture. 
I do not exactly agree. 
This would give customers an idea of the laws under which a company operates.  
Her efforts, single-handedly, propelled this report forward. 
All are females, except one. 
That shows you what can be done if we try hard.  
On motion of Senator Maheu, debate adjourned.  
Election of canada to united nations security council 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I wish to participate in the debate on this issue. 
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Acting Speaker) :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, June 16, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
