The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Ms White's life and accomplishments are inspirational. 
She is a woman in whom all Canadians can take pride and inspiration.  
Her success struck a blow for equality.  
Portia had a remarkable career. 
In April of that year, she also performed at Massey Hall in Toronto. 
After a long fight with cancer, Portia White passed away on February 13, 1968. 
According to historian, Hilary Russell: 
Congratulations on Winning Formula One World Championship

Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon the Speaker:
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Estimates, 1997-98 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Wednesday, October 29, 1997, I will move: 
Notice of Motion to Refer Vote 25a to Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, October 29, 1997, I will move: 
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, October 29, 1997, I will move: 
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
Findings of Letourneau Commission- Government Position 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I shall quote from the executive summary of that report. 
The commissioners noticed that much of the testimony of witnesses: 
Further, the commission comments that: 
These are harsh words indeed.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Letourneau commission was one of those reviews.  
In other words, nothing has been done to date. 
They have attempted to put a new face on the military. 
New appointments have been made. 
I understand my honourable friend's concerns. 
Talk about "curiouser and curiouser"! 
Could the Leader of the Government kindly tell us when it will be appropriate?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We will continue to advocate that approach. 
Honourable senators, it seems that other players are now getting into the mix. 
It would not be the first time we beat the Americans.  
Not in hot air; that is for sure.  
Does that mean we beat the Americans by one dollar more? 
Does it mean we will make a fund for $5 billion plus $1? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, let us put the issue in perspective. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this is not an issue of registered retirement savings plans. 
Honourable senators, I am not specifically aware of how this applies to self-employed Canadians. 
The issue is indeed when. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, CPP contributions are savings toward pensions. 
They are not a tax. 
I believe that would be grossly unfair. 
We on this side do not agree with that approach. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
As usual, he is ahead of me. 
I will attempt to bring forth a complete answer as soon as possible.  
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod 
Changes to Traditional Title-Role of Privy Council- Government Position 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I read in Erskine May at page 177: 
By what authority has an attempt been made to change the title? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I believe that Honourable Senator Kinsella is absolutely right. 
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I congratulate him for his persistence on this point.  
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
Is the Leader of the Government aware of any such review taking place?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware of any review. 
Honourable senators, that is not entirely accurate. 
The matter that is before the court is a question of malicious prosecution. 
As it relates to this matter being before the courts, that is not true.  
How can Mr. Munro get out of the Liberal doghouse? 
Exactly why is he in the Liberal doghouse? 
He served the party well for over 20 years. 
Does the leader think that will help Mr. Munroe's cause at all?  
Honourable senators, this is an unfortunate situation. 
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Ron Ghitter on October 7, 1997) 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on October 7, 1997) 
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are accompanied by His Excellency, their distinguished ambassador. 
I wish you welcome on behalf of all the senators in the Senate of Canada.

Tuesday, October 28, 1997 
The Hon. the Speaker :

Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Permit Electronic Coverage 
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Continued 
6th day of resuming debate ) 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
Why not limit my comments to the education of francophones?  
Harley D'Entremont said, and I quote: 
Under section 41 of the act, the federal government is committed to, and I quote: 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I wondered if that was really the case. 
However, that is all it was - pious invocation. 
That is good, but what was new? 
Massive changes were necessary. 
How do we deal with this so-called dividend? 
Do we put it toward debt reduction? 
The fragmentation of the process itself is harmful.  
How is a fair share and balance to be achieved in our programs? 
A country that invests in its children successfully will have a better future. 
How will our children be integrated into the next century? 
What about their personal lives? 
How do children know which changes to deal with? 
How will they deal with them if all we do is study them? 
However, let us look at the record of previous governments.  
Honourable senators, we looked at developing alternatives to incarceration. 
We wanted to nip crime in the bud, but what have we done? 
All the dollars went into incarceration.  
There is, honourable senators, no such law. 
Surely, in the adult system, even more is required. 
We should not forget those who are harmed by their criminal acts. 
Rather, the consequences of crime are reviewed. 
How does someone pay for a crime? 
How does the community continue to live with that offender? 
There are other systems of justice, and they work. 
We want to be in partnership. 
What we have is some pious invocation and some good directional programs. 
However, where is the real response to real change in the aboriginal community? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for Senator Andreychuk to continue?  
It certainly should not be a time of self-congratulation.  
Social justice must be worked into our programs. 
There is no greater example than in the area of the environment. 
What is our fair share in terms of utilization of the environment? 
What will we leave to future generations?  
After all, there will not be another generation if that is the route we follow.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Leave having been given to revert to Presentation of Petitions: 
TO THE HONOURABLE THE SENATE OF CANADA IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED 
Child Custody and Access Reform 
Special Joint Committee Established 
That the Committee make its final report no later than November 30, 1998; and 
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The ground swell was enormous and powerful. 
I received few negative responses. 
They turned to their feminist journalist allies, in particular Michele Landsberg. 
She heaped scorn upon me, a Liberal senator. 
She ended her article by strenuously urging all to condemn us, saying: 
Only Tory leader Jean Charest can rein in the destructive excesses of his Tory caucus. 
There's no time to lose. 
They faxed and telephoned. 
Mr. Charest's office was swamped with calls and faxes for the next two days. 
Honourable senators, this response was typical of these public outpourings. 
In some instances, the support was even higher, up to 90 per cent.  
I found the number of witnesses and meetings too few. 
On February 3, 1997, he wrote: 
He ended with a plea: 
The House of Commons concurred with our amendments the next day. 
I shall speak briefly to these two issues. 
The manipulation of time becomes the prime weapon in the hands of the alienator...  
Such a case of false allegations is Plesh v. Plesh . 
Her motivation was revenge, pure and simple. 
On September 3, 1995, in a Winnipeg Free Press article entitled "Abuse:
Too many cry wolf," Allison Bray reported that: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the time allotted for the honourable senator has expired. 
Is leave granted for her to continue?  
Honourable senators, Anne McLellan continued: 
Motion in Amendment Adopted 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
That the motion be amended by 
(a) deleting paragraph 1 thereof and substituting the following: 
(b) adding the following after paragraph 9: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt this motion in amendment?  
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
Honourable senators, I have read this amendment to the motion. 
They have gone even further. 
I support the amendment as it is put forth.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure honourable senator to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to, as amended.  
Ninety-Seventh Conference, Seoul, Korea-Inquiry 
Honourable senators, it is with pleasure that I take part in this debate. 
This represents an unacceptable assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction.  
The IPU has always strived to select topics that are timely, relevant and opportune. 
In Seoul, for example, the cases of 121 parliamentarians in 12 countries were raised publicly. 
Let us continue to support its valuable work.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Would Senator Bosa accept a question?  
Can the honourable senator tell us anything about that?  
I know that other countries have done so as well. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Committee Authorized to Continue Study on Asia Pacific Region 
Hon. John B. Stewart , pursuant to notice of October 22, 1997, moved: 
We are seeking the authorization of this place to do that work.  
Authorization of Committee to Engage Personnel 
Honourable Senator Bacon , pursuant to the notice given October 23, 1997, moved: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Committee Authorized to Engage Services 
Hon. Lorna Milne , pursuant to notice of October 23, 1997, moved: 
Committee Authorized to Permit Electronic Coverage 
Hon. Lorna Milne , pursuant to notice of October 23, 1997, moved: 
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, October 29, 1997, at 1:30 p.m.
