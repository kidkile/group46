Review of Nuclear Weapons Policies 
Wednesday, March 24, 1999 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
National attention was riveted on Ottawa as it has seldom done since. 
A few hours later, the government fell. 
Their report, "Raising the Bar:
But it was an awful lot better than this." 
I should like to end on a more personal note. 
Horror stories were related, one after the other, in every awful detail. 
With them, too, are Orville's sister Flora and her daughter Elaine. 
Unfortunately, the Phillips' three other children, Brian, Robert and Betty, cannot be here. 
I can't help that. 
I'm just one of them." 
I wish you many happy years for an active and healthy retirement. 
You have certainly earned them.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That story has been better told - lest we forget.  
We had six divisions in our army. 
Senator Phillips was part of that remarkable Island contribution to freedom. 
Thank you, Orville, for being Orville. 
That is where Senator Phillips comes in. 
He has supported and encouraged her. 
Unfortunately, Senator Cools has not always reciprocated. 
and Senator Phillips has said, "Watch Senator Cools." 
A lesser man would be absolutely crestfallen. 
He fought for the economic and political interests of the Island. 
I would not say that he bestrides the Island like a colossus. 
The last of the veterans have long since departed the House of Commons. 
They brought more than camaraderie or esprit de corps. 
Senator Phillips has exemplified all of these qualities. 
Hon. Archibald Hynd Johnstone :
I was just lucky, I guess.  
When I awoke in the morning, he was in the bunk next to me. 
Imagine seeing that face first thing in the morning. 
However, his was a sunny face. 
I know what he has been telling you. 
I want to tell you the real story. 
The truth is that the Royal Air Force petitioned to have me. 
I suggest that other senators follow his excellent example.  
Hon. C. William Doody :
I got to know him in 1979 when I first came to Ottawa. 
We have become fairly well acquainted since that time. 
He never seemed to be the least bit dismayed or upset. 
He was completely calm and unfrazzled by any of it. 
He, Senator Marshall and Senator Bonnell have done yeoman's service in that department. 
All three of them, and others, will be sorely missed, but their work was outstanding.  
I will not say a great deal more. 
I think most of it has already been said. 
I know that I will miss Orville very much. 
I thank his family for lending him to us for as long as they did. 
I will make sure he has my address, no matter where he goes.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
I must tell Senator Murray that I shall continue to keep him in suspense.  
The committee travelled to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in May of 1984. 
He meant to say "feast," but he said "feed." 
That became a private joke. 
In any event, it was quite a feast that the Islanders put on for us. 
Senator Le Moyne was quite right, it was a marvellous feed. 
He himself ate about eight lobsters.  
In any event, I remember the evening very vividly. 
It is now a practice that has passed away among senators. 
I will remember that evening forever.  
However, Senator Phillips is one of the last.  
The committee report "Guarding History" speaks for itself. 
I wish you all the happiness that you could ever know. 
The history of Barbados is very rich. 
The history of plantation society is not widely known. 
I thank them for that.  
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
Honourable senators, I should like to add my comments to the tributes. 
I just want to be treated the same as any other great man." 
Senator Cools already mentioned it. 
Orville and I have a number of things in common. 
Of course, we have both served in this chamber for over 30 years. 
We have something else in common. 
Dr. Keon operated on both of us. 
He looked after Orville's heart and he did the lobotomy on me! 
Fortunately, his treatment has worked for both of us. 
As long as Dr. Keon is here, the Senate will last, I should think, forever.  
I hope we will see you again soon.  
He has given the Senate many years of most loyal service. 
I wish him long life and the best of health. 
Our very best wishes go with him on his retirement.  
That is not a side of Senator Phillips that I saw. 
I struck out time and time again. 
Guess what happened, honourable senators. 
He has been a warm and generous friend of a true Grit like myself.  
So he should be. 
Prince Edward Island has never been very far from his mind. 
Thank you so much for sharing your friendship with me. 
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
Senator Phillips said, "I am a doctor. 
I said, "You are a dentist. 
This is a chest injury." 
He said, "I will go. 
He said, "A doctor of divinity beat me to her!"  
I said, "Orville, what happens if I am the only one standing?" 
He said, "No, I have that covered. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Orville, have a good vacation and good rest. 
We will see you soon on the No. 1 "T."  
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
Senator Phillips has had a distinguished and productive career in the Senate. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I have known Senator Phillips since 1957. 
Over the years, we developed a keen, beautiful friendship.  
There are so many things that could be said. 
I travelled with him in Asia and in Great Britain. 
He knows about everything that London can offer.  
In Asia, it is the same thing. 
On this particular day, I was sitting right upstairs in the gallery watching the deliberations. 
I was interested in the proceedings. 
I watched Senator Phillips repeating certain gestures. 
I have now succeeded in solving that mystery. 
I must admit that I was a little unruly myself in those difficult days. 
I did not approve of the change in atmosphere. 
I believed that the Senate should always be distinguished and different.  
I knew he was about to tell me something negative. 
Then I learned another lesson. 
Senator Phillips knew about the British parliamentary tradition. 
I was the first one to do that. 
I have been followed by others since then. 
During our study I got to know Senator Chalifoux. 
I was able to work with Senator Cools. 
The Senate will soon lose two friends, Senator Orville Phillips and Senator Johnstone. 
These are two of the best, most knowledgeable friends of Canadian veterans. 
The Senate will be poorer; veterans will be poorer. 
The Senate must strive to fill those very important roles.  
Any time you come to the Senate, I will look forward to visiting with you. 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
I am now beginning to wonder if I should speak.  
In spite of Orville Sparrow's difficulty, Orville Phillips did not have any today. 
I knew exactly who they were talking about. 
I had an awful temptation to prompt. 
I hope you can get along without me.  
I will give a bit of advice to the Liberal whip, who is new. 
I wish to thank Senator Cools for her remarks. 
I should like to correct one statement made by Senator Johnstone. 
He said he would submit it for the Governor General's Award. 
To my friend Senator Prud'homme, I say thank you. 
Perhaps someday Senator Prud'homme will tell me that. 
Sure, there are regrets. 
I served under eight. 
That is the reason I have such great respect for him.  
I should like to refer to the leadership in the Senate. 
They were all able individuals and friends. 
Occasionally, I did not share their views. 
He did everything he could to assist us. 
Honourable senators, when there were only 17 Conservative senators, we had no research or assistance. 
I have always wanted to pick on Senator Graham a little. 
I let Al off easy for that reason. 
Senator Sparrow mentioned that I had served on a good many committees. 
Honourable senators, I believe I have served on every committee in the Senate. 
I served on a good many special committees. 
The witness was a professor from Queen's University. 
They are the ingredients that formed our nation. 
Those immigrants will blend in and further strengthen our nation.  
Honourable senators, we do not need to be further divided. 
I am distinct because I am a Canadian.  
That is an expenditure involving both federal and provincial funding. 
No one in the House of Commons responsible for federal appropriation raised a voice. 
No one in the provincial legislatures responsible for provincial appropriation raised a voice. 
That announcement, too, was made on television. 
Again, the House of Commons did not complain. 
It was the premiers who complained. 
It is time to return to the way we used to be. 
You can still do that. 
They may come up with a great solution.  
The same applies to agriculture. 
We kidded each other about who was to blame for those problems. 
Problems for the unemployed are the same all across the country. 
They all want to work. 
All senators can discuss those issues and perhaps find some solutions.  
People ask me what I plan to do in my retirement. 
I am not looking forward to that. 
Lloyd and I suggested that the filing cabinets could go in the dining room. 
I plan to take up painting. 
Honourable senators will be surprised to know that I am artistic. 
The railing on the steps is beginning to rust. 
I found spray paint at Canadian Tire. 
I have one so far, but I believe I need two.  
Approximately halfway along that line is the North Star. 
You will occasionally see me in the gallery. 
I know a number of you have been there. 
It was Senator Lawson. 
I know Senators Forrestall, Oliver and DeWare have been there. 
It also has squash courts and canoeing and wind surfing. 
I hope when you come there you will give us a call. 
She is always glad to have visitors. 
I always wanted them to work with me, not for me. 
Thank you Joan Riley, Morley Verdier, Doris Witson, Chad Rogers, and Lloyd Lawless. 
I wish to say thanks to the staff. 
All have been helpful at some time or other. 
The most important thanks of all are to Marg. 
She was both a supporter and a critic. 
She was very proficient at both. 
Like most political wives, she had to raise a family. 
Some were born after I joined politics. 
She did an extremely good job at raising our family. 
Our oldest boy practises law in Calgary. 
Our youngest, Patricia, and her husband, Gerry, teach school in Ottawa. 
We have eight grandsons and one granddaughter. 
A problem is somewhat like an approaching thundercloud:
You do not wait until that cloud is there before you take action. 
Honourable senators, yesterday and today are experience, tomorrow is the opportunity. 
I wish you luck.  
Announcement Regarding NATO Air Strikes 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Secretary General of NATO has announced that air strikes are underway.  
The atrocities have been going on too long. 
We are not engaging in this course of action lightly or with any pleasure. 
These resolutions were all too often ignored by Yugoslavia.  
NATO has now no other choice but to act. 
We cannot let instability in the Balkans spread. 
We cannot tolerate ethnic cleansing. 
Visit of President of Palestinian Authority to Parliament 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
He will, however, be meeting the Prime Minister at four o'clock.  
I want to draw attention to the efforts over the years of Senator Macquarrie. 
He should have been in the gallery with Mr. Arafat. 
In view of the change in the program, that will be impossible.  
Today, we still refer to Mr. Arafat as the Chairman of the PLO. 
It is the same even in press releases. 
I am neither his interpreter nor his messenger. 
We hope that you will be able to address us the next time."  
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
That is out of order. 
Conference on Religious Persecution 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Today, we heard about the situation in Kosovo.  
The Holocaust was a pivotal historical tragedy. 
Welcome to New Senate Mace Bearer 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I should like to introduce him to you now. 
He is Mr. Richard Logan, who is a native of Ottawa in the first instance. 
He left his job as executive director of operations in 1986.  
During that course of service, he received many awards and honours. 
We welcome him to the Senate as mace bearer.  
We hope you will find the position both interesting and rewarding. 
Welcome to the Senate, Richard Logan!  
Federal Coordinator On Homelessness 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :

The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Wednesday, March 24, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs has the honor to present its 
2. Page 6, Clause 16: 
(a) Replace line 6 with the following: 
"(2) If requested to do so by a preclea-".  
(b) Replace lines 13 to 19 with the following: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?

The Hon. the Speaker :

All Committees Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Government Services Bill, 1999 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Later this day, honourable senators.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I believe that requires leave.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
International Assembly of French-Speaking Parliamentarians 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Is there a direct relationship between the two?  
Honourable senators, the matter is being addressed at the Security Council. 
Is that the policy of your government? 
Honourable senators,I should hope that it would be the policy of the government. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Tomorrow may the last day that we sit for a protracted period of time.  
Tomorrow is usually a cabinet day. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a brief supplementary question. 
I welcome the positive response from the minister. 
However, we are entering a country into which we have not been invited. 
I am sure that Canadians generally would appreciate that.  
I am very mindful of the concerns expressed by Senator Forrestall. 
We must stop President Milosevic from continuing the carnage. 
It is our responsibility as Canadians to work with our allies. 
It becomes a question of who is my neighbour. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, that is a good point. 
If we have a responsibility to our neighbour, who is our neighbour? 
Why are we not doing the same thing in Ethiopia/Eritrea or in Russia? 
How far are we going on this? 
Why are we focusing on the Balkans?  
Why are we not interfering in those, too? 
Why are we limiting ourselves to this conflict? 
We were drawn into those quagmires.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
This is a joint decision.  
He made his final decision today. 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
War Veterans Allowance Act 
Department of Veterans Affairs Act 
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Veterans made many sacrifices for their country and for their fellow citizens. 
Many of them made the ultimate sacrifice. 
Today, your actions are paying a glowing tribute to them.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
This is good as far as it goes.  
Honourable senators, the number of war veterans in Canada is declining every year. 
Hon. Fernand Robichaud (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Government Services Bill, 1999 
Second Reading-Point of Order 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Since then, there have been a number of amendments. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I cannot explain why they are not here.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
This is an issue of great concern to the government.  
They have initiated a series of rotating strikes in various parts of the country.  
This proposed legislation does not signal any change in that position. 
The government has always been willing to negotiate fairly and openly with its unionized workers.  
We believe in fair pay for public servants.  
Our economy is being seriously affected. 
Our international reputation as a reliable exporter of wheat has been put at risk. 
I wonder whether what we have in front of us is in order. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I just checked with the Deputy Clerk. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, His Honour says that this is emergency legislation. 
We do not have the bill before us. 
This is an urgent bill. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
At the moment, I do not have an answer. 
I have no difficulty with that suggestion. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have never received a certified copy from the other place. 
I will enquire from him as to what the rule is. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is signed by the Clerk of the House of Commons with the date. 
It is a certified copy. 
That is the normal practice with other bills. 
The Deputy Clerk receives the certified copy.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
This bill was sent with the insert that you have.  
We do not have that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I think the point has been made. 
I hope the government agrees with what I think is a very generous suggestion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, my remarks will be even briefer than I expected. 
It gives the employer the edge. 
I wonder where the "national emergency" is today? 
I, for one, do not believe so. 
It may be unpleasant, but it is legal. 
I repeat that they are not even on strike at this moment. 
Let us put things in perspective. 
It is a sloppy piece of work. 
I will take a few moments to focus on a couple of issues. 
First is the issue of the collective bargaining process. 
Is that not somewhat of an oxymoron in terms of presentation?  
There are more than 4,000 such correctional officers.  
That conciliation board reached a majority decision. 
They know full well that there is no emergency. 
These workers are not even out on strike.  
It is expected to be ratified by the membership. 
All that is required is an acceptance by the government of the conciliation board recommendation.  
They have made a recommendation which one party to the dispute has already accepted.  
We, as members of this house, represent every corner of Canada. 
In principle, I am opposed to anything other than a national rate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thank Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton for having raised the question. 
Do any other honourable senators wish to speak?  
If not, is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read the second time.  
Referred to Committee of the Whole 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Appropriation Bill No. 1, 1999-2000 
Honourable senators, I should like to speak very briefly with respect to Bill C-74. 
However, we shall be meeting again in April and May on the Estimates. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Bill 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Does it say what the proponents argue is its purpose? 
What is the objective of Bill C-55? 
The result, however, is that the Charter objective is difficult to discern. 
Both legislative initiatives attempt to prohibit a form of advertising. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
Motion to Refer to Transport and Communications Committee-Debate Adjourned 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, the work of committees in this place tends to be somewhat uneven. 
Hence, the argument Senator Carstairs has provided does not stand up.  
I simply do not understand my honourable friend's reasoning. 
Members of that committee have studied this issue. 
Let us take advantage of what we have and build upon it.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the current discussions are somewhat irregular. 
Is there leave that this debate continue?  
Hon. W. David Angus :
Honourable senators, I wish to add a few words on this subject. 
What Senator Lynch-Staunton has just said is quite true. 
It was a terrible thing.  
As a member of the Banking Committee, I was involved in its study. 
Let us face it, this is a controversial piece of legislation.  
If and when the bill - 
- and they are referring to Bill C-55 - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I also have a piece of important information to bring before the Senate. 
He has imputed motives on my behalf.  
The Senate decides, you do not.  
However, Senator Angus has gone beyond that. 
I should like to argue the case on a matter of principle. 
The standing committees should fight for their turf. 
The issues raised by Senator Graham related to antidumping, which is a trade matter. 
That is a dumping proposition.  
Senator Graham also argued on the basis of fair competition. 
That is not the case...  
I wish to emphasize that Canada has played by the rules. 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Usual channels might be able to resolve this.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That is why Bill C-103 was referred to that committee.  
You will find that on page 92 in our rules.  
There are no second-class citizens in this Senate. 
We are all senators, appointed the same way.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I must ask for "yeas" and "nays." 
Those in favour of the motion will please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Those opposed to the motion will please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "yeas" have it.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Appropriation Bill No. 5, 1998-99 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
However, I should like to read it into the record today, if I may.  
The letter is dated March 23. 
It is from Patricia J. Mella, Provincial Treasurer.  
I will read now read the presentation into the record.  
Members of the Senate Committee on National Finance 
My comments are essentially divided into two parts. 
Second, specific points of contention concerning the legislative proposal.  
Essentially the Province has been severely underpaid during the last two years. 
This means that the five year improvements will take five years to fully take effect. 
For PEI it is worth $3.2 million. 
This decision saved them $345 million per year. 
There are several key aspects of the renewal package that the Province finds objectionable. 
It is signed by the Honourable Patricia J. Mella, Provincial Treasurer, P.E.I. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read the third time and passed.  
First Nations Land Management Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
I cannot stress this point enough. 
Let us take the last first. 
She expresses her fears as follows: 
Honourable senators, perhaps my colleagues from Quebec could listen to me.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
They have special status in the Senate.  
Ms Lockhart Lundberg continues: 
Bill C-49 contains two provisions which are particularly worrisome for native women.  
This shows show you just how paralyzing this dispute is. 
Their dispute was conducted in the pages of The Vancouver Sun .  
Chief Gail Sparrow disagrees: 
A woman in Ottawa wrote: 
The residents are all consumed by fear.  
Again using her words, she says: 
I hope we can utilize this opportunity. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator St. Germain, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Review of Nuclear Weapons Policies 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will take the adjournment on that item.  
The Senate adjourned until Thursday, March 25, 1999, at 9 a.m.
