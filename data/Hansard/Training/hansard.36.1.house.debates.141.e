The House met at 10 a.m. 
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in this manner?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
ROYAL CANADIAN MINT ACT 
Let us get into these amendments a little more. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I will first look at the object of the Canadian mint. 
The act goes on to detail rather specifically exactly what the mint is to do. 
Its legislative powers are as indicated in the object.  
That is a pretty comprehensive list. 
It is one of the largest gold refiners in the world. 
It also carries out research on coinage demand.  
The minister told us that in the last year it had a profit. 
That is a very interesting development. 
I would now like to read the summary contained in the bill itself: 
This is the core of this bill. 
Other amendments of an administrative nature are also enacted.  
It is that central part that we want to draw some attention to right now. 
It is a mature stable industry. 
We are dealing here with section 4(1). 
Remember what we said the powers of the mint were before. 
Here are the new powers: 
(b) acquire and dispose of any interest in any entity by any means; and 
(i) coins of the currency of Canada, 
(ii) coins of the currency of countries other than Canada, 
(iii) gold, silver and other metals and, 
One thing is very clear already. 
The mint is in the refining business. 
It is clearly in the business of refining gold.  
The act is very clear that it may buy and sell metals. 
But very closely allied to this is the full commodities market. 
The futures market is a very volatile market. 
Let me indicate how significant the hedging program can be. 
There is a speculative element in here as well.  
Why is this significant? 
We have to be thankful I guess for small mercies. 
At least it is limited to $75 million. 
It was $50 million. 
It is our money at risk.  
It can be argued that it has been able to do that in the past. 
There is some indication that the mint has borrowed money in the past. 
Somebody would say that is a stretch. 
I hope that is not the intent. 
Should the government own a corporation that can be in direct competition with private enterprise? 
There is clear evidence that they can do so. 
What is some of the evidence?  
It is not fair. 
It is an unbalanced situation. 
Canada can be proud of the number of innovative ideas that have come from scientists. 
We can be proud of those kinds of things.  
It is not fair. 
That includes the current demand of the Eurocoin.  
The argument is that it is a business decision.  
Is the minister in charge? 
Is the government in charge? 
Or is it the mint that is in charge?  
Was that done by the minister? 
Was it done by the government? 
Was it done by the finance minister? 
Or was it done by the bureaucrats at the mint? 
We do not know. 
It is not clear at this point. 
We need to go beyond this. 
We need to ask ourselves how successful crown corporations have been.  
Canadian National Railways became a private corporation recently. 
There is progress being made, but it is not complete.  
We really have to ask ourselves what is the best relationship. 
It is to $75 million but it is too high. 
The bill needs to be amended. 
In fact they need to go ahead. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
This is a legitimate objective, and one that is hard to oppose.  
Who would the shareholders be? 
Far be it from me to suggest that such a door be opened voluntarily. 
However, consciously or unconsciously, the end is the same. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Our community needs those rail lines''. 
There are elements of the bill which are purely of a housekeeping nature. 
We have some concerns, some of which have already been mentioned.  
The question of the subsidiaries needs to be looked at. 
I believe it is only with circulating coins. 
I do not think 15 days is adequate. 
It is certainly something the committee should look at. 
It is just not enough time. 
I am familiar with the work of the mint in Winnipeg. 
It is not in my riding but it is close by. 
There is more than one way to privatize. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will now proceed to Statements by Members. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, October is Women's History Month. 
This year's theme is entrepreneurship and unpaid work. 
She was born in Upper Canada in 1831. 
In 1863 her husband contracted tuberculosis and she sought medical training. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
There is, however, a positive side to this story. 
Sheldon can hold his head high knowing he did the right thing. 
Canada can be proud of Sheldon Kennedy.  
NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WEEK 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
The sky is no longer the limit. 
These men and women are the best in the world. 
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Many more get sick and require hospitalization.  
The facts are in. 
The evidence is clear. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
A tax break for middle and lower income Canadians is needed immediately.  
This would be an important first step toward reducing the poverty which currently exists.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
As of today it is 996 days away.  
UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
THE LATE JEAN RAFA 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
He also went on many tours of Quebec. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
He failed to do so. 
The minister is looking the other way as the Europeans and Americans increase their subsidies. 
LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
What is the response from this federal government? 
This is the Liberal government's slap in the face to hardworking and dedicated employees.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Higher feed crops are now threatening our beef industry.  
The economic hardship for farmers is extraordinarily serious. 
Many will soon be on the verge of bankruptcy. 
Immediate financial assistance is essential to prevent many from going out of business.  
This is no time for finger pointing between federal and provincial governments. 
I urge this government to immediately assist these farmers in crisis.  
KICK DRUGS OUT OF CANADA 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I think we should wait and see what that statement is.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
We do not need to wait. 
When will he strike a new independent judicial inquiry?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We want to see the commission do its work. 
Senior representatives of the Prime Minister's office are ready to testify before the commission. 
Why does the hon. member not want to let the commission do its work?  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
It is not going to be able to get to the bottom of this.  
I ask again, will this government restore public trust and strike- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
This commission as set up by this parliament is independent of the government. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Dewdney-Alouette.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Why the double standard? 
Why the double standard?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no double standard here. 
The solicitor general is not a member of the commission. 
He is not a member of the panel. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Now we hear the commissioner saying exactly the same kinds of things.  
Why the double standard?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
There is no double standard. 
The solicitor general is not a member of the commission. 
He is not part of the inquiry. 
He cannot direct the inquiry.  
It is at arm's length from the government.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this really feels like a circus.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the government is turning itself into an object of ridicule.  
This is turning into a farce.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the premise of the hon. member's question. 
There is no Liberal scandal. 
We want to do things properly in this matter.  
That is a double standard.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
If confirmed, he has no choice but to resign. 
When will the Prime Minister do the right thing? 
When will he fire the solicitor general?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The solicitor general is not part of the commission. 
He is not a member of the commission. 
He did not create the commission. 
He has no authority under the law passed by this parliament to direct it.  
We do not know exactly what Mr. Morin is supposed to have done. 
We have not heard the statement of the commission. 
Let us wait and hear what is said. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister was reading from the news reports. 
Forget the double standards. 
When will the Prime Minister do that?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not criticizing the news reports. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is a fact.  
Thanks for the vote of confidence in the government.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This smacks of cover-up. 
What is the government hiding?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is hiding nothing in this matter.  
Again, thanks for the vote of confidence.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Thanks again for the vote of confidence.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister is stonewalling again. 
Canadians are tired of this comedy of errors.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I object to the premise of the hon. member's question. 
Once again, I thank the Reform Party for its vote of confidence.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very glad this question was asked. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Canadians, on the other hand, know better. 
The blame lies at the Prime Minister's feet- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. 
I had not realized that the hon. member had actually asked a question.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
His government appointed these people to the commission. 
That is a person we want to have on the inquiry.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I ask members to direct their questions through the Chair.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The people are appointed for a term. 
They are at arm's length from the government. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
That is not a lot to ask.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
The shipping industry agrees with recovering 17% of costs. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The solicitor general today did not set up this inquiry. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
These things have all been suspended by the government.  
We need a judicial inquiry to clean up this mess.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member mentioned constitutional rights.  
PROGRAM FOR OLDER WORKERS ADJUSTMENT 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear here.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
We also heard that they are adjourning the commission meetings until November 16.  
Justice delayed is justice denied. 
Will the government do it right away, now? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think a correction should be made. 
The panel has been recessed until November 16.  
I have just had this information conveyed to me. 
It is public information as the hon. member has in part conveyed to the House. 
I have not had a chance to- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Wanuskewin.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
The solicitor general did exactly the same thing. 
I would say what is good for the goose is good for the gander.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Why does he not listen to his hon. friend's question? 
He will learn something.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
We know what is happening. 
The commission is mired in distrust. 
When will he set up a judicial inquiry?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
If he wants some independent comment, surely it comes from the federal court.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is the proper step to have taken. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
This creates a major interprovincial trade barrier. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Perhaps the Standing Committee on Transport could examine it. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Is the Tory party asking us to do that?  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister has charged some people here as being pretzel-like. 
I will tell this House where the pretzel is. 
Canadians are waiting for truth and justice to take place.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Let us hear what the federal court has to say about this. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Before that, it was ``Wait for the commission''.  
It is obvious that the commission is an annoyance to the government. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Thanks again for the vote of confidence. 
I hope it is recorded on the record.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Gerald Morin's denials are not enough. 
Canadians have lost confidence in the RCMP Public Complaints Commission.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I question the premise of the hon. member's question. 
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
It is the same with Nav Canada and the millennium scholarships. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment. 
A man was trapped and died in the tar pit.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
I would like to thank the hon. member for her question.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
The developments today are the last straw. 
Canadians have absolutely no confidence in this inquiry. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the premise of the hon. member's question. 
Do I look like someone capable of fancy footwork?  
I would say to the hon. member, please get real. 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have been following the recent crisis in Kosovo with great concern. 
It is important to remember the tremendous human costs caused by such conflicts. 
There are currently 200,000 refugees who have fled to avoid the conflict. 
What steps have been taken to provide for these people?  
Mr. Speaker, the refugees of Kosovo are facing a very difficult winter. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
REPRODUCTIVE AND GENETIC TECHNOLOGIES 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
The petitioners call upon parliament to enact legislation regarding a ban on human cloning. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three brief petitions for the House today. 
The first has to do with human rights.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today. 
Question No. 110- Mr. Chris Axworthy: 
The Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The installation of an air independent propulsion system is not part of the UPHOLDER project. 
AIP is currently at the ``proof of concept'' stage at Ballard Power Systems in Vancouver. 
Question No. 127- Mr. Lee Morrison: 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.): 
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
ROYAL CANADIAN MINT ACT 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I particularly like the emphasis on the hon. member. 
I find it interesting to follow the hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona. 
Let us talk about the bill just a little bit. 
The bill will go back to committee. 
We have a corporation right now that provides the service to the Royal Canadian Mint. 
That corporation will be in jeopardy. 
It is not a level playing field.  
I wish the members from the NDP would listen. 
This is not some crystal ball gazing. 
The $30 million announcement is just to build the plant. 
However, the construction of the plant began in March 1997.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member should check his facts. 
I think what he just said is false.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are infringements being suggested against Westaim at this point.  
So let us listen again. 
Yet the plant is being constructed as we speak right now. 
This venture violates the Liberal government policy. 
But I wish to see them happen only according to good business practice. 
This is not one of those. 
Back then the Liberals nationalized Petrofina and created the national energy program. 
It would be left up to cabinet to be approved in secret, behind closed doors. 
The decision would be solely that of cabinet. 
That is the where that decision should remain. 
That will be one of the amendments when the bill goes before committee. 
This would not be the case if this legislation were to pass.  
It violates the existing government policy of getting government right. 
I hope the government is listening. 
Second, it exposes scarce tax dollars to needless risk. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I get tired of listening to it. 
We all know he is going to vote for Joe Clark tomorrow. 
There are no new ideas coming from the Conservative Party, especially the member from Manitoba.  
Volvo, a profitable corporation, laid off 223 employees. 
Air Atlantic laid off 525. 
The list goes on and on.  
I did not accuse the member for Winnipeg-Transcona of wanting to nationalize Coca-Cola. 
It is an industry that has overcapacity. 
These people are going to be jeopardized by that.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I simply cannot believe my ears.  
I would like to see where the members are for the Reform Party in Ontario. 
On Monday there will hopefully be a new leader of the Progressive Conservatives. 
Our policy will remain Conservative policy. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, thank you for an opportunity to rebut. 
He comes from that same riding. 
There are inequities with respect to government competition with the private sector. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very important that we put this issue to rest here. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, we are kind of getting off topic. 
However, I do enjoy the bit of banter between Reformers and Progressive Conservatives. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 12.37 p.m.)
