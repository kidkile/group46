ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 73 
Friday, March 13, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT 
Why then is the minister asking for an additional $1 billion? 
Why was the review not done earlier? 
Clearly Industry Canada has been asleep at the switch. 
Anyone who doubts me need only look at the main estimates.  
Of course we cannot. 
Steadily increasing taxes are leaving small businesses with no retained earnings. 
All of their funds are going to Ottawa. 
Retained earnings are essential for small businesses to grow. 
The amendment before this House is not unreasonable. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
This is not the case.  
This feature of the act provides Parliament with regular opportunities to review the program. 
Why will this review not be completed before the end of the lending period? 
This is where the auditor general's report comes in. 
This was a prudent decision. 
I do not believe that anyone would want this review to be rushed. 
There are many complex and far reaching issues that must be addressed.  
In that way the comprehensive review will take place without disrupting the program. 
Some of the recommendations the report made had already been acted on by this government. 
Others will help form the discussion in the comprehensive review.  
He maintained that it would benefit from more precision in its objectives.  
I would like to briefly respond to some further issues raised during the second reading. 
Current lending on registered loans is capped at $14 billion. 
This is exactly what Bill C-21 is trying to avoid. 
It has broad support among the business communities. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
That is what it means.  
In fact, the concerns of the auditor general are widely shared. 
We all know it is impossible to develop without reasonable access to funding.  
What does the Canadian Federation of Independent Business have to say? 
To my mind, the Reform Party's amendment is totally uncomprehensible. 
However, this would mean that several businesses would find themselves in a difficult situation. 
This statement does not reflect the truth. 
In fact, a very large portion of the money already loaned has been paid back. 
They are the ones that innovate and create jobs. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
This is an objective that we share in the New Democratic Party. 
This comes right from the auditor general.  
That is most unfortunate because these people are encouraged. 
A business cannot be started with this ideology. 
We need small businesses and they need access to financing. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
That said, we have some concerns with respect to the act. 
That is not the access to capital these individuals want.  
The intent of the legislation has gone to the wayside.  
We support both these amendments. 
The legislation has to continue.  
The small business sector needs a small business loans act. 
It needs a loan guarantee program for incremental loans. 
It does not need a loan guarantee program for large scale loans.  
This is not just me saying this. 
It is now a huge amount of money. 
We are heading toward $15 billion in loan guarantees. 
In 1997 the acceptance rate for loans has actually gone down 2% from 1987. 
We will be supporting the amendments to this legislation. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Few will deny the importance of small businesses. 
They are the engines of the growth of the Canadian economy.  
My wife owns a dry-cleaning store in Calgary. 
I am a junior partner. 
She has been operating this business for the last 15 years. 
I am an owner of a small international consulting firm. 
This program does not successfully aid small business owners who truly need assistance.  
Lastly, enforcement is poor.  
I agree with the auditor general because of the following reasons.  
The Canadian economy is in a state of transition. 
The current small business loans program does not take this into account. 
He also calls on this government to strengthen the program's auditing of potential borrowers.  
This entails giving entrepreneurs access to capital.  
Business owners need the government off their backs. 
They need an economic environment which allows entrepreneurial spirit to excel. 
Did the government do that? 
They must also take certain risks. 
Profits are at record levels. 
Today with their record profits banks can afford to be partners. 
They must do this or risk losing their monopoly.  
Less taxes mean more profit. 
This is the route we should be following.  
This $1.3 billion is adequate- 
The hon. member for Levis.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
This is therefore very important for small businesses.  
Yet that ceiling has already been reached. 
It is inconsistent, but not surprising. 
Reality is another matter. 
I will make one final point, and then I will sit down. 
I will recognize the hon. member for North Vancouver. 
It is your call.  
We will now go to Statements by Members.  
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S WEEK 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my compliments to the Reform member across the way.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Smuggled goods are now being moved freely through Canadian ports.  
Canada's port police have been phased out. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
The Liberals' priority is obvious: this government is obsessed with its visibility.  
What is wrong with this picture, Mr. Speaker? 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Let us consider the most recent economic and employment evidence. 
Adult women also benefited by the February employment increase. 
This trend has been sustained over the past 12 month period. 
In that period full time employment has risen by 470,000 jobs.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
They are committed to realizing the full potential of these initiatives.  
I urge members of the House to encourage the government- 
The hon. member for Calgary Centre.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
The tax assault on stay at home parents is particularly odious. 
Homemakers are becoming increasingly frustrated and are beginning to take action.  
She has now taken her complaint all the way to the United Nations.  
She has a strong case. 
Homemakers call on the government to stop- 
The hon. member for Gatineau.  
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
The hon. member for Levis.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
The federal government is not fooling anyone in Quebec with its razzle-dazzle.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
I would also hope that the member would stand and apologize to seniors everywhere.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have a passion for hockey like no other sport. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Full time employment rose by 84,000 in February. 
Two-thirds of this gain was in full time work. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
They are fighting to be on strong social and economic ground.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
The government knows we have to continue to do more. 
This is good news for all Canadians.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the message is clear. 
The Liberal government has only scratched the surface of the Y2K problem. 
There is a lot of work to be done with only 460 working days left. 
Now the estimates are rising daily. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Yesterday, the cartoonist went one better than that. 
I think that is an excellent idea.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
The people of Alberta have expressed their will 
The House must now heed their call 
That elections for Senate be their wish 
That fairness in governing be for all 
Through election is our method 
To be effective is our purpose 
Equality for all be our goal 
We ask this House to listen now 
We ask Premier Klein to echo this call 
We ask that this reasonable wish 
Be respected and confirmed by all 
For Provinces that wish to vote 
Alberta's call will not abate 
From this you may well quote 
The solution be simple and has support 
Stan Waters was first and led the way 
Albertans wish to elect their choice 
This House must listen to what they say.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, March is Red Cross Month in Canada. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are not hiding things the way the former Mulroney Conservative government did.  
The millennium fund is in aid of students. 
Why is the Reform Party speaking against the interests of students?  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Apparently the finance minister has made them up.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's assertions are completely unwarranted. 
Speaking of dummies, that is a dummy question.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, speaking about dummies that was sure a dumb answer.  
Thank God it's Friday.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have carried out our commitments. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are preparing for tax time. 
We are getting a little strong in our words. 
Please be very judicious in your choice of words.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very simple. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada does not meddle in education. 
Financial help for students is a responsibility of the two levels of government. 
The federal responsibility dates from the turn of the century. 
I found a program in this regard at the beginning of the century. 
So this is nothing new.  
The hon. member for Laval-Centre.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The parliamentary secretary refused to give his agreement.  
However, the parliamentary secretary is on his feet so perhaps he can clarify it.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can clarify it for you.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The parliamentary secretary is contradicting his own minister. 
Will the parliamentary secretary listen to his minister and stop obstructing- 
The hon. member for St. John's East.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
We have to scrap those unfair U.S. subsidies.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Nonetheless, he asked the question.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
We do not need more talk. 
Canadian taxpayers do not want to subsidize their teams either. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We have talked to the hockey teams. 
They only cover goods. 
The hon. member for Joliette.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
The agreements with unions will vary according to the economic conditions of each branch.  
As for the auditors, there are other compensations complementing the collective agreement. 
We are very pleased to have been able to reach an agreement.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I think he wants to become Dick Clark, the king of the new year.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the premise of the hon. member's question is wrong. 
What we are talking about is about $2 per Canadian. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Many Canadians are asking themselves which size of flag she will be giving out. 
Will she be doing that?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is remarkable. 
The Reform Party is now against the display of the Canadian flag.  
They asked to participate in our national program. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my apology. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Yet, just yesterday, the Prime Minister said that the federal government was respectful of jurisdictions.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have to correct the preamble. 
The hon. member for Vancouver Island North.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is known as revisionist history. 
The minister is always talking about putting conservation first. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
There is no substance of truth to him.  
Light keepers have been of great assistance to many people. 
I was pleased to have the conversation on information at that time. 
Never was my vessel in any danger.  
We are bringing in 12 new lifeboats of a new design. 
We have increased the funding for the- 
The hon. member for Sackville-Eastern Shore.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the same minister.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a bad day for the opposition on fisheries questions.  
But there is a continuing list of projects that we are approving- 
The hon. member for Sackville-Eastern Shore.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
All we ever get from this minister are vague answers.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Not that it is not a good project. 
One, its impact on improving- 
The hon. member for Fundy-Royal.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of agriculture.  
If not, why not?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
There have been different views on this issue. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
MUTUAL LIFE OF CANADA 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this very important question from the member for Ottawa-Vanier. 
We will try to minimize job losses. 
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the minister of fisheries.  
Now we have been harpooned. 
Is there something this minister should be telling us about Moby Dick? 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
That will be done within the next four weeks.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
If so, will that person please stand and be recognized for the record?  
We have established teams in every one of the departments. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
This will cut the processing time in half. 
Returns take just minutes to file over the phone. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Co-operation.  
In February, Father Curic, a missionary from Quebec, was savagely murdered in Rwanda. 
The CIDA program was to end in 1998. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the minister of agriculture. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
There is $3 million there for water quality issues. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
What is very critical is that it is not the year 2000. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
This is not a point of order, but a point of debate. 
We will end this matter here.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
There is no consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I did not fully understand what the motion was. 
Perhaps the motion could be brought to the Chair.  
The motion, as drafted, does not make complete sense to the Chair. 
We will deal with it later.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
They therefore urge the government to seriously review the potential threat to Mr. Suresh.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a number of petitions to present.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have another petition signed by 28 petitioners.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the final petition I want to present is signed by approximately 230 people.  
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
They are always tied up in bureaucratese. 
They use other people's money. 
It is simply unacceptable to do that. 
Instead of being in business they are considered investors. 
It is typical Liberal government. 
It cannot stop itself from spending money. 
One of my constituents wrote me a letter: 
Since it has no electrons, administratium is inert.  
He points out very well the sorts of things that go wrong with government programs. 
It simply does not work.  
There are some crazy ideas out there.  
We would certainly not increase the liabilities to taxpayers by one single dollar.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
That has not happened and as a result of that look what we are adding. 
We are adding more to this program but we have not brought about any conclusions. 
During the thirties he decided to make a living by raising sheep. 
That is exactly how we looked at these programs. 
That is exactly what the government is doing with this program.  
I have often wondered why. 
Is agriculture not a business? 
If it is not a business, why is it not? 
Farmers are disregarded from bringing about loans as such under this act. 
It is an agricultural business. 
Farmers should be treated with more equity than they are presently being treated.  
That business divides the amount of business in the area in two. 
Both businesses end up being failures. 
These things must be looked at in depth. 
It is a big problem throughout the areas with this act.  
It is a scary thing as we get into the rural areas. 
There would be more detail in each loan going out. 
No one would disagree to money going to help small business. 
We do not think the way the act is right now is achieving that end.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on Motion No. 1.  
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Everything seemed in order. 
It comes down to a very basic question of democracy.  
No one objected to that. 
She was very clear. 
That is because the federal government is fulfilling a commitment to those groups. 
Decisions could be made that affect their land and their claim process. 
They will have minimal, if any, say.  
Those are the reasons we do not support the bill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Our country is very large and extends right up to the Arctic circle. 
I would appreciate hearing that.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for this opportunity.  
The impression I want to make is that the land mass is huge. 
We want to be heard and understood. 
We want to be a valued part of the country. 
I ask them to imagine if they had to represent a physical area that large.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
I am told this is no ordinary bill. 
One of the most remarkable features of the Northwest Territories is the Mackenzie Valley. 
It is one of the world's longest valleys. 
It is hard to imagine a river at 4,241 kilometres and a huge valley. 
That brings us to the present day.  
We are all hopeful that the many years of dialogue might have borne fruit.  
If they represent a principle it would be one related to good government. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The government does not intend to call any other government business this day. 
Is it agreed to call it 1.30 p.m.?  
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
The reality would be quite the opposite.  
Allow me to illustrate my comments by focusing on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 
Information is the stock in trade of the CBC. 
This would mean that information in possession of the CBC would become accessible to all.  
Revelation could result in reprisal.  
This statute reiterates this independence, in particular to the CBC. 
The Broadcasting Act of 1991 reaffirms the CBC's arm's length relationship. 
The CBC currently generates $300 million in the marketplace. 
They are the centre pieces of the CBC's corporate governance process. 
The legislation before us would cause more harm than good to Canadians. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
There was a strike at Canada Post last fall. 
The public has many questions about the administration of this organization. 
The same applies to Atomic Energy Canada. 
He is in favour of this bill. 
Another Liberal refuted this.  
This is proof that what my hon. colleague who spoke before me said was incorrect. 
In a report entitled ``Open and Shut:
This must be seen as a rather significant element.  
The number of crown corporations has since grown considerably. 
This may be justified for reasons of efficiency. 
A provision to that effect should have been included in the act.  
NavCanada is a corporation responsible for air safety. 
Let me give you another example. 
NavCanada and Canada Post are very telling examples.  
Citizens can currently ask a department to produce documents. 
The Access to Information Act is not always easy to administer. 
The same situation applies to crown corporations. 
Their numbers are growing.  
For example, what will the revenue department look like in the future? 
There is talk of a new tax collection agency. 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Current coverage is sporadic.  
In the report entitled ``Open and Shut:
The same applies to Alberta and B.C. 
This motion was debated in the House in April of last year and was passed.  
I would like to compliment the mover of Bill C-216, however. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Certainly I commend my hon. colleague for bringing that forward for debate.  
In the agricultural field there is the Canadian Grain Commission. 
Therefore, they are held accountable.  
It would seem to me that taxpayers deserve and have the right to transparency. 
They talked about the transparency of their accounting practices. 
They cling to the notion that there is transparency in their accounting.  
They do not have to comply with the Access to Information Act. 
I do not want to use up all the time today. 
I certainly agree with the thrust of that letter.  
That is exactly the purpose of this bill today. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I want to say a few words about the CBC. 
I will end my comments on that note.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
If a particular body is not listed, the legislation does not apply to it.  
By definition, crown corporations serve the public interest in a commercial environment. 
Crown corporations already respect the spirit of the government's broad socioeconomic policies. 
They have been subject to the Official Languages Act since it was passed in 1969. 
They also apply the principles of employment equity.  
They must operate in an environment free from the undue interference of government administrative constraints. 
This balance must be protected if we want crown corporations to be successful.  
Therefore I must firmly reject the bill in its current form. 
I am very confident there are good reasons for doing so.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
The Canada post office is a monopoly. 
It has no competitors. 
Canada Post operates one of the largest courier businesses in the country. 
There are two problems with that. 
The Canadian public is captain of Canada Post. 
Because of its monopolistic situation people have no alternative. 
We have absolutely no way to tell this whatsoever.  
Maybe not, but it has sure been subsidized to a pretty penny in the past. 
It still owes a tremendous amount of money to the government, hence the Canadian taxpayer.  
We take that very seriously on this side of the House. 
I certainly hope the hon. member does as well. 
All other parties in this House are supporting this bill. 
There is no consent.  
(The House adjourned at 2.00 p.m.)
