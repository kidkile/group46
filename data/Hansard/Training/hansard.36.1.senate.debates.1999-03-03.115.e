National Women's Curling Championship 
Congratulations to Colleen Jones Rink, Halifax on Winning 
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
They have our heartfelt respect and gratitude.  
Recognition as Engineering Achievement of Twentieth Century 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
Many felt that it would never happen. 
Tourism is now a serious rival to agriculture as one of our most important industries. 
Many of them lost their lives on the job.  
These nurses have served their country well. 
I believe it was the first time that they have been so recognized. 
The Late Jack Webster 
British Columbia Journalist-Tributes 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
Jack was a very ethical journalist. 
Jack never had his mind completely made up. 
He was an implacable interrogator. 
It was a challenging experience.  
Jack Webster was an adornment to the Canadian communications community. 
Jack was born of Scottish descent in the working-class side of Glasgow. 
He emigrated to Canada in the late 1940s. 
Jack's passing represents a great loss for communications in this country. 
Jack Webster will be greatly missed by all of us.  
He was a refreshing kind of person. 
You could never take Jack for granted. 
Jack had a way of cornering you that was unique. 
I will resign when you resign from this particular program." 
Jack practised one philosophy consistently. 
In other words, down with whoever is up. 
Let us pull the guys who think they are smart down a peg or two. 
Let us ensure that humility reigns in "political-dom" and "business-dom" and "labour-dom." 
Jack felt that his role in life was to be a great leveller.  
We will miss Jack. 
As Senator Perrault says, he was a great communicator and a man of high integrity. 
International Search or Seizure Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canada and the Nuclear Challenge 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday, March 11, I will move: 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
He had not completed the year. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
On that occasion, we expressed our regret and extended our sincere sympathy to the families.  
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
If so, could the minister tell me how much?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, again, I would be happy to look into that matter. 
It should be pointed out that Grand Chief Fontaine is a duly elected chief. 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
This refers to a question put yesterday in the other place. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would have to read the transcript of what was said. 
I leave it to Mr. Peterson to clarify what he meant. 
The second part of the statement by Minister Peterson is even more incomprehensible. 
Honourable senators, I was not in the other place, I was here. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is for to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham , Leader of the Government:
That is a very good question. 
The review speaks to indigenous people. 
Obviously not all honourable senators would necessarily associate themselves with this particular report. 
We had people from all over the world who came to that particular conference. 
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Canadian Race Relations Foundation 
Effect of Proposed Amendments Contained in Legislation-Government Position 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on February 9, 1999) 
The government is not proposing to change the Foundation's basic role. 
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Is that an intent of the motion?  
It sounds that way.  
Yes, that's right.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
I think an honourable senator is interested in further debate.  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, I should like to pursue this matter further, if I may. 
We have been planning our work schedule along that line.  
I should like to ask the deputy leader if this might be an oversight. 
Could we look at this again?  
On motion of Senator Comeau, debate adjourned.  
Vote 25 Referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages 
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Vote 10 Referred to the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament 
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Access to Census Information 
Hon. Richard H. Kroft :
I speak on the understanding that it will be adjourned in her name again.  
The issue has been further expanded upon by Senators Fraser and Andreychuk. 
Thankfully, Statistics Canada, for whatever reason, never agreed to do so. 
Did I really want to advocate more intrusion into private information? 
I commend their speeches to you. 
This bothers me, too. 
Senator Mahovlich, I hope, will not read anything into that remark.  
Part of my interest in this subject comes from personal experience. 
What are the reasons for denying knowledge that could so easily be available? 
Important, meaningful information is being locked up or, as some would have it, destroyed. 
There are, indeed, some very difficult and important issues that must be addressed. 
There is another related question that is both legitimate and difficult. 
Can we now move to open some or all of that? 
Would it be a fundamental breach of faith? 
We are hurtling forward in the information age. 
It is a matter that could be well served by the attentions of the Senate.  
On motion of Senator Kroft, for Senator Johnson, debate adjourned.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall rose pursuant to notice of February 16, 1999: 
He, in turn, asked if I would initiate a debate. 
Is it a move to frustrate many of the efforts of NATO in this regard? 
The NATO Secretary General is asking for Canadian participation.  
This is what I find so troubling. 
Where is the solution to the situation in Kosovo and the Balkans? 
Kosovo and the Balkans may be cases of this nature.  
Kosovo has been fought over for centuries. 
The Serbs consider it to be the cradle of their civilization. 
I do not have the answer. 
Perhaps, as Professor Stokesbury would say, there is no answer.  
Is NATO now a global policeman? 
We all know what that would lead to. 
There are also reports that Russia will unilaterally rearm the Iraqis.  
Both want to be dominant regional powers. 
This time, neither Iraq nor Serbia have backed down from confrontation. 
Our relationship with Russia is tenuous, at best.  
That is a strategic question that we must ask. 
Certainly, it is a question that must be answered.  
This situation could turn to war at a moment's notice. 
Where would we be? 
We do not know what the national command relationships will be. 
What are the rules of engagement? 
How will we sustain them in Kosovo? 
How will our troops be equipped? 
Does this mean an end to the Bosnian commitment? 
Notions to that effect are destroying the Canadian army.  
Finally, honourable senators, we do not even know who will pay for this venture. 
Canadians want to know the answer to these questions and many more. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
