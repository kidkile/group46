Wednesday, March 25, 1998 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
He is so very wrong. 
Canada's unity spirit is not bought with cheap flights. 
He cannot stop the Canadian will by limiting mere dollars. 
He cannot abate our support for Canada by writing new laws.  
Canadians together celebrate our solidarity with Quebeckers. 
Canadians will travel again and again when called. 
We will be there in thought. 
That is our promise to Mr. Cote. 
He must know where reality lies. 
He will never extinguish our will.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
These august men and women have built this great country at considerable cost to themselves. 
Our path through life has been made easier because of our sterling seniors.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
That is a major conflict of interest.  
MATTHEW DA COSTA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Is this what it calls its number one priority? 
The government must put patients first and give politics a back seat.  
DOMUS TROPHY AWARDED TO CITY OF LACHENAIE 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
This position garners a whopping $1 per year.  
By the way, he is a former Reform MP.  
The Liberal government appoints people based on qualification, not party. 
The leader of the Reform Party and his band of jokers have it wrong again.  
I think they owe their western supporters more than this. 
WORLD WATER DAY AND WORLD METEOROLOGICAL DAY 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Everything in the air affects climate as well. 
This appears to result in such things as floods and ice storms.  
Our lives are at stake.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
But yesterday the Prime Minister took this honour. 
Actions speak louder than words. 
Liberal actions show their arrogance. 
Is this the politics of division that the Liberals speak of so often?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
But are Liberals listening? 
Nova Scotia Liberals did not listen either. 
Today they are not quite so smug. 
The problem: federal Liberal cuts; federal Liberal indifference. 
Liberals have not listened. 
Perhaps they will now. 
Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Labrador, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the round of applause. 
It is great to be back.  
ANNUAL MERITE DES GENS D'ICI GALA 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The B.C. salmon crisis is a recent problem. 
It was not inherited from the Tories. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Thank you very little.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Do you want more?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
I could go on but I will get up again.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Finally we are getting questions from them. 
I thank them for their interest.  
We had retirement of licences. 
In addition we have El Nino.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let me tell the government what it has really done.  
He slashed funding from fish hatcheries and let Americans- 
I encourage my colleagues to listen to the questions and to the answers. 
I will go back to the hon. House leader of the opposition.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the millennium fund project is losing its lustre.  
Even Quebec Liberals are trying to help the federal government out of the mess.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is absolutely ridiculous.  
I have already met with the Federation des etudiants universitaires du Quebec. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It will complement what is already provided by provincial governments.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
So did Nova Scotians.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have done it. 
We want to do it in the years to come- 
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
My question to the Prime Minister is simple. 
Will he do that, yes or no?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general is the Canadian taxpayer's watchdog in Ottawa. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general will have access to the millennium fund's books.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
This is not a time for political finger pointing. 
Aboriginal people are calling for a judicial inquiry. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
A criminal investigation has started. 
The province of Alberta has jurisdiction in this case. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The hon. solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member for Charlesbourg.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
This is indeed quite an insight into the Liberal mindset.  
Is it simply to be a Liberal?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Here there is a time limit. 
Some are partisan and some choose to sit as independents. 
It is their choice. 
The Senate studies and reflects on the bills of the House of Commons. 
It is not under the pressure of the next election. 
Perhaps we should not have- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Senator Andrew Thompson's attendance record has been dismal for years. 
Now Senator Andrew Thompson has retired so that he can get his huge enormous pension.  
The member is asking an opinion of the Prime Minister. 
If he wants to answer the question, he can.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would remind the minister that spring is now here. 
It is time he came out of hibernation and did something. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have often talked about the transitional job creation fund. 
We are going to respond to the committee in due course. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The answer is the individual is not being investigated. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is confusing because the article reads differently.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It has been demonstrated and it is very clear.  
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have it here.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Same oil, different price.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again the foundation of the question is simply inaccurate.  
We in addition have response organizations organized by private industry. 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We would think at least he would listen to the legions of backbenchers from Ontario. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The hon. member for Burnaby-Douglas.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
British Columbia will have a representative on that high level team. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly can assure the member of that. 
CANADA MILLENNIUM SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is an outside foundation. 
Its books will certainly be available. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what is happening right now. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, fisheries management in British Columbia is in a mess. 
However our minister thinks he has found a way to solve the Pacific salmon crisis. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I am glad he was.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the finance minister.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We will be addressing the post-TAGS environment in eastern Canada in a responsible way.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Zlatko Dominikovic, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Croatia.  
I would like to thank the opposition House leader and the member for Windsor-St. 
The first motion was presented as part of the business of supply. 
The hon. member for Windsor-St. 
MAIN ESTIMATES, PART III 
REPORT ON PLANS AND PRIORITIES, 1998-1999 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
MARRIAGE (PROHIBITED DEGREES) ACT 
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RELIEF COORDINATION ACT 
DEPOSITORY BILLS AND NOTES ACT 
(Motion agreed to and bill read the first time) 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
They say that they want to draw the attention of the House to the following: 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
They see it as being anti-democratic.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition deals with parental rights. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
They also note that it is anti-democratic.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Being a neighbour of one of the petitioners, I totally agree with the petition.  
I hope he will refrain from doing so in the future.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I am especially proud to present a petition which comes from Calgary.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The petitioners are very concerned about the multilateral agreement on investment. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Therefore, the petitioners want this Parliament to reject the MAI.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
They believe that this agreement is flawed. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's concern. 
Under the circumstances, I do not know what else we can do. 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
BILL C-36-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is pure hypocrisy.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
I rise, on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I am not sure that either of their votes should count.  
He has three minutes remaining in his speech.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
It recommended that there be no delay in implementing this. 
Taxes are still too high in this country. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was speaking about small business. 
The hon. member talked about the debt level. 
I want to draw the member's attention back to the 1989 Wilson budget. 
How does that help small business? 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Kelowna for the question. 
He and I sit on the same committee.  
We are starting to realize the very seriousness of the year 2000 problem. 
We are talking about $6 billion just to fix the problem. 
Who knows what the legal ramifications will be.  
Yesterday we had a presentation on the embedded chips. 
It is not that easy to fix something. 
It is the cost of replacing them. 
This is a very critical problem which the government has to get serious about. 
It is also planning the millennium party. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
As a result, health and education services provided by the provinces have been cut severely.  
We still receive less and less money in each of the next several years. 
However, that is cold comfort for Newfoundland and Labrador. 
We have an unemployment rate that is double the national average. 
We also had a net outmigration in Newfoundland last year of 9,200 people. 
Tax cuts announced in the budget are very modest indeed. 
They are not large enough to kickstart the nation's domestic economy. 
We need a better formula.  
We need a more generous arrangement for equalization entitlements. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member covered a lot of ground. 
Each province will have to look at that carefully.  
My question for the member results from his final comments. 
I am sorry the member has. 
A number of opportunities are facing us. 
The comment I made applies to the people of Atlantic Canada generally.  
There are no job creation efforts in the budget. 
It is the same old song and dance routine with the Liberals. 
The hon. member talked about transfers to the various provinces. 
I am sorry I did not have a little more time to go into them. 
These are the provinces that have been hit the hardest.  
It is the same song and dance routine from this government. 
Many good things are happening in Newfoundland. 
Voisey's Bay hopefully in the not too distant future will start up. 
These are things which will happen in the future.  
We need jobs now in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Nine thousand two-hundred people a year are leaving our province. 
I really fear for that little province. 
Newfoundland should not have that kind of haemorrhaging.  
We have a great deal of concern about that.  
We will now begin 10 minute speeches without questions and comments.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
This in itself would deserve extensive comment.  
I would like to address another angle in particular. 
As we know, he is the Bloc Quebecois finance critic.  
It is a program totally unacceptable to us''.  
This critic needs to get real. 
It is also the key to mobility throughout their career.  
Canada is not just a marketplace. 
It is a community. 
We strongly believe in it. 
There are a number of elements to this strategy. 
I think these are significant sums. 
Canadians have the right to know the truth.  
Once again, we are talking about opening the door to co-operation. 
I think it would benefit young people in Canada and Quebec. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
It has done this 38 times. 
There is a lot of deception in this budget. 
Yet the auditor general deplores the methods used by the finance minister.  
In 1969 our debt was zero. 
In just three years it quickly went to $18 billion. 
That is the thing we should be talking about. 
That is what the people say we should take care of. 
That is what is threatening our social safety net. 
That is what is threatening our health, education and pensions. 
That is what is going to hurt our future generations more than anything else. 
This government chooses to ignore that and begin more spending.  
People are literally on the streets because they have lost their sources of income. 
Rice prices have gone up time after time. 
Japan has an overextended bank situation. 
It has absolutely no consideration about the world in which we live.  
What happens when cheap competitive products come on the market? 
That is going to effect the U.S. economy. 
When it gets a cold we get pneumonia. 
This government has totally abrogated its responsibilities in planning for that future.  
Look at the figures regarding our debt. 
Our interest payment is $45 billion. 
We are falling behind other places in this world. 
Our expendable income is dropping. 
This government had choices. 
It could deal with the debt and the problems it brings. 
It chose the third option. 
It never has and it never will. 
Are there savings we could make?  
That is what a future government is going to have to face.  
People out there are not stupid. 
People out there know that is not true. 
This government chose not to listen. 
That reaction will not be favourable to the finance minister or to this government. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
In particular, the bill launches the Canada millennium scholarships foundation. 
I want to take a moment to outline the other elements of that strategy. 
We are proposing therefore two new measures to help them.  
This measure will benefit up to 250,000 Canadians. 
This new measure will benefit some 50,000 part time students with children.  
Finally, our strategy takes action to improve Canadians' access to the information highway. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
First, the millennium scholarships. 
This has been a pet project of the Prime Minister for some time, it seems. 
I have noted a few details as I went along.  
4. The Foundation is not an agent of Her Majesty.  
It is, therefore, a foundation that is not a direct agent of the government. 
In principle, this would be a totally independent foundation. 
These six will then appoint the others.  
Some things are a bit odd. 
The first point is ``when a member dies''. 
Some things in this bill are unnecessary.  
But that is not the problem, as we know. 
Why in the year 2000? 
It is after visibility.  
This program cost $60 million including the flags.  
I am the Bloc Quebecois critic on regional development. 
To the Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions Agency.  
This is all a visibility operation. 
I will skip the small figures. 
Finally, some cuts affect very specific programs. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It makes a lot of difference to students. 
What do we do about it? 
We have several choices. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
EUTHANASIA AND ASSISTED SUICIDE 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
Dying is the final act in the drama of life. 
She asked for the right to stop supportive treatment. 
Two other cases are worth mentioning here. 
That is not dying with dignity.  
Finally, the case of Robert Latimer raises other questions. 
In this case, he was not the one who was sick. 
She had no hope of getting any better.  
Sooner or later Parliament will have to make a decision.  
Anything but the freedom of choice?  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
This issue is not a new concept. 
The practice of euthanasia has been around for as long as mankind has experienced disease. 
It has commanded the political spotlight for years. 
This would also be consistent with thousands of years of established religious philosophy.  
I would be remiss if I did not mention the matter of assisted suicide. 
It does not want its members to engage in the practice of assisted suicide. 
I have been a member of this House for only a few short years. 
We have already done that.  
My personal views with respect to euthanasia are quite simple. 
They are not the same.  
I would strongly disagree. 
I understand that this is an extreme example. 
This is absolutely unacceptable.  
Once again I reiterate my opposition to the motion before us. 
I have been and continue to support the law as it stands. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Such refusal is not considered euthanasia. 
I believe that would be the second reason that slim majority would collapse.  
The public needs to know that. 
The availability of these services varies from region to region. 
That is hardly representative of the democratic will.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
This was no accident. 
Fundamental human rights such as the right to life are inalienable. 
This is what the preamble of our constitution suggests. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
He has done it with courage. 
It is not an easy matter to deal with. 
I would like to deal with several points. 
That is why this issue will not go away. 
We only have to look at the tragedy of what happened to Sue Rodriguez. 
The impossibility of the status quo exists in part because of our inaction. 
More and more people are choosing to become educated and informed about their health. 
In that context there has been a public debate.  
I was interested to see a poll that was done in December 1997 by Pollara. 
I do know what it means to be with someone you love who is dying. 
I do know what it means to care for someone in that situation. 
I am a very strong supporter of palliative care. 
I believe we have an obligation to resolve this issue. 
Surely it is the proper course of action that we pass this motion. 
I urge all members of the House to support this motion.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Let us be clear about that.  
Let us consider the doctor-patient relationship. 
The trust inherent here must be preserved. 
We will have to justify our own survival. 
The legal framework must enhance the common good. 
In the first instance, the patient is allowed to die. 
In the second instance, the patient is killed. 
The distinction is integral. 
We must not accept the concept of killing.  
This House will decide the timing of such a debate. 
The essence of that debate is as I have described. 
We must look to all the issues that are before us. 
We do not have the option to engage in emotionalism.  
We are not able to take an easy course. 
It is their legislator's first concern.  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the Clerk having announced the result of the vote: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I want to clarify my position. 
I am profoundly opposed to this motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion lost.  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1997 
The question is on Motion No. 1.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 1, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 1 lost. 
The next question is on Motion No. 2. 
Is there agreement to proceed in this fashion?  
Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members present will vote yes to this motion. 
I would like to add the member for North Vancouver as well.  
Mr. Speaker, Bloc members are in favour of this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, NDP members present in the House tonight vote yes.  
Mr. Speaker, the members of our party vote yes.  
Mr. Speaker, I will be voting yes to this motion.

Mr. Speaker, members of the NDP present vote yes to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the members of our party vote yes.

I declare Motion No. 3 lost.

Mr. Speaker, members of the NDP in the House tonight vote no to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the members of our party vote against this motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Needless to say, it is a very serious problem.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
I should qualify this statement by saying that work is being done in Canada. 
I would like to make a couple of suggestions. 
We might incorporate those into- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the minister's time has expired.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Vancouver East is one of the most multicultural ridings in Canada. 
Vancouver East is also home to many multicultural organizations and services. 
I also heard very strong concerns about the process of the review itself. 
There was also a lot of concern about the recommendation concerning language requirements. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
It was written by an independent group of consultants. 
It is not the minister's or department's report. 
The minister is not bound by any of the 172 recommendations.  
Initially the minister intended to conduct five days of consultation. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I will give it a little preamble after that as well.  
My question was quite straightforward. 
My question was straightforward. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will try to be very concise.  
That is what we need in the fishery.  
I stress that the primary focus of the Langara Island issue is not about conservation. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the time has expired.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
It should be noted that the draft regulations were released January 24. 
The public was given until only February 23 to respond. 
Is it the industry or is it the Minister of Health? 
Is the Minister of Health involved? 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I should mention that her party seldom attended these meetings. 
The committee recommended revisiting the regulatory regime.  
Discussions with stakeholders have continued since that time. 
As a result changes, were proposed to the regulations. 
It was business as usual.  
The new regulations address these problems. 
We are the only country that has both a regulatory- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that the hon. member's time has expired.  
SUPREME COURT OF CANADA 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Exactly what kind of sociological advice did the minister receive in making the appointment? 
Did the minister not consult with former Justice La Forest?  
In the United States the president nominates candidates to their supreme court. 
To date, 12 nominations have been rejected and 17 have been withdrawn.  
The public process has merit. 
Should we not want the absolute best judges to make rulings in our highest court? 
Do we not want to raise the public esteem of the court?  
On the other hand the Senate could hold ratification hearings.  
Provincial justice ministers want change. 
Former supreme court justices want change. 
Why is the minister ignoring these pleas? 
The government even says that it wants change and then nothing happens. 
It is like the Young Offenders Act issue since 1993. 
Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Let me assure this House that this government- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the time has expired.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.50 p.m.)
