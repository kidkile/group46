EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 186 
Monday, March 1, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP) moved: 
If they say that, I am afraid they are wrong.  
The main estimates from 1998-99, however, show a different story.  
Another result seems to have been the chaos at management level. 
She pointed to a single line buried in an old press release.  
The arrogance of this will not be lost on Canadians.  
The government has a choice to make and I call on it to make it. 
It is basically giving it death by a thousand cuts.  
What an odd thing to say. 
Is the core of all these issues not money?  
The CBC gets most of its funding from the government. 
The new Minister of Labour should know better. 
These Liberal ministers should look for a career change. 
Instead, it has plunged it into rancour and turmoil. 
Give us back the CBC.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Where does that $1.2 billion or more come from? 
It comes from federal taxpayers and private cable companies.  
As an aside, I recently heard something very strange. 
One broadcaster refused it, the CBC. 
That is an aside.  
More than $250 million comes from advertisers. 
What will the CBC's role be in the new millennium? 
What will be its role on the international stage?  
No advertisers, no money; no profits, no licence to broadcast. 
Is the CBC worth its combined revenues of $1.2 billion or more? 
Should the CBC get one more cent from Canadian taxpayers? 
At this time without further review of the CBC I certainly would say no.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
It reads as follows: 
Until very recently, the Bloc Quebecois would have supported this motion unconditionally. 
The article states as follows: 
Yes indeed, it was the hon. member for Shawinagan, the present Prime Minister. 
Unfortunately, he has not changed over the years. 
And the article I was referring to earlier indicated, and I quote: 
This must never happen. 
Fortunately, the government dropped this idea following public outcry.  
-to meet its stated public service goals.  
That statement should apply to all the members of his government. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
The CBC was established on November 2, 1936 by an act of parliament. 
Canadian interest in broadcasting has existed since the beginning of this century. 
Two years later public broadcasting was well under way in Canada.  
There is no questioning the importance of the CBC to the promotion of Canadian culture. 
Canada's broadcasting industry is in a state of flux. 
The CBC itself is in a state of transition. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
To address the particular issue, I want to point out a few things.  
The CBC is one of the pillars of our broadcasting system. 
The CBC occupies a central position in the Canadian audio-visual landscape. 
It is an ambitious mandate. 
It intends to be the Canadian broadcaster. 
We are confident the CBC will be able to perform in this very competitive environment.  
In conclusion, the issue raised in the motion has already been addressed. 
The service offered by the CBC is one of the best in the world. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The corporation under the government opposite has no money. 
I find interesting another refrain we hear all the time from government members. 
One of those bureaus is in Mexico City. 
It is a very worrisome trend that the government seems to want to perpetuate.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I put that fact on the record.  
We enjoy it even when they poke fun at us because its usually very humorous.  
What a great venue it is to bring Canadians together. 
Those are very good points, but the question here is with respect to funding. 
I did not read the article but I heard about it. 
I said I would never give that magazine a nickel because of what it did. 
I have the right to do that. 
I have kept that promise with one exception. 
On one occasion there was a very funny article. 
It was an outrage. 
I asked what I could do and there was nothing. 
They have the right to crank it out. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
They are the bulwarks for our defence against an unending swamp of American products.  
We do not need just CNN feeds. 
We do not need to hear another country's particular take on issues. 
We need to know what we think.  
He was kidnapped during the Chiapas uprising. 
He was actually saved by their investigative reporting.  
I think that these kinds of things are important. 
I think they are signals. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
BILL C-49-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is not a point of order.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
As is our custom, the government whip has walked in. 
He has indicated that he is ready for the vote.  
I invite hon. members to return to their seats. 
We are now ready to proceed.  
We have a regular procedure which we go through. 
We will take the votes in an orderly fashion. 
I hope that we can clear this up in the next minute or two. 
We are going to take this vote.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
This parliament also seems powerless to do anything about this.  
It removes judicial protection from bands. 
These are some positive things that we have seen in this legislation.  
We have had a major concern addressed during committee stage hearings. 
We noted this deficiency. 
We appreciate the fact that there was no opposition to it. 
That means development can take place without adequate consultation.  
They are opposed to the legislation. 
To say that the goodwill of people is all that is required is somewhat naive. 
This bill has not provided that. 
They cannot get rid of them. 
I beg to disagree. 
It is a very important amendment. 
It is not one that was lightly put forward by the opposition. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
For one, neighbouring jurisdictions have not been defined. 
Would we expect any municipality to accept such a paternalistic system? 
As such, these powers have been provided for in Bill C-49. 
This does not allow for arbitrary expropriation.  
The court is also available for the same kind of challenge.  
Canadians know that this power is invoked in the interest of the community. 
They know that those who have property expropriated will be compensated.  
The powers are not automatically in place. 
However, third party interests will not be exempted from expropriation. 
Everyone in Canada is subject to the power of expropriation.  
I urge the House to support Bill C-49.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
One wonders in this country why we talk about western alienation. 
That happened after one day of debate on this issue in the House of Commons. 
One day we hope to change that.  
He is endorsing the Liberal Party.  
They say that I am endorsing the Liberal Party. 
This person is going to be the next premier of that province. 
I want to read the letter into the record.  
The letter is to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  
The letter goes on to state: 
With respect, that assurance offers little comfort.  
I will re-read that: 
With respect, that assurance offers little comfort. 
That commitment was not honoured. 
That is simply unacceptable and must be corrected.  
That is why they are always a minority in the House.  
The minister comes into the House with this bill. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
We will not be supporting this motion. 
It is absolutely necessary that the schedule identify the 14 participating first nations. 
This is not useful or even workable as an amendment. 
It does not improve the bill. 
In fact it would only serve to change the commitments made in the framework agreement.  
This bill does not create a third order of government. 
The framework agreement provides first nations with greater control over their future. 
This bill establishes a framework for accountability. 
That is important to note.  
One of the issues raised in committee was the question of matrimonial property. 
I remind the House that the government has taken this issue very seriously. 
The action plan has four objectives. 
Each of them has a bearing on the bill before us. 
The benefits will also spread to neighbouring communities that will prosper from economic development spinoffs. 
New partnerships will be forged between the first nations and surrounding communities. 
The framework agreement that this bill provides is a win-win-win situation. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
For the 48th time it has stopped debate in this House. 
It does not want their voices in this House.  
I ask you to think about the rest of us when you are deciding.  
I know this woman. 
She speaks from experience. 
That is what this government is putting this person through.  
This letter is from Sharon Willicome, also from the Lower Kootenay Indian Band: 
What fair remedy will exist to protect those rights?  
There is too much at stake and too much to lose.  
The third letter is dated February 13 and reads: 
They found clean water and lots of it.  
If Bill C-49 were passed, she would lose her land. 
The Band would have its land, and an old lady would not.  
It is but another opportunity for the elite to govern the lives of the oppressed. 
She wants me to send her any updated information. 
The Indian affairs minister is a woman. 
Why doesn't she understand the plight we find ourselves in? 
What about these women? 
The Liberals do not care. 
That is really frustrating to me as I listen to the people in my constituency.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is really light weight.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
There has been some misunderstanding and I would like to set the record straight.  
I will address the issues of each of these third parties. 
The theme is common to all. 
I will outline the issues raised by the provincial governments affected. 
We consulted on the issue by removing provincial expropriation powers. 
We consulted on the extent of the expropriation powers for first nations. 
We consulted on environmental protection regimes.  
Under the existing regime the federal government gets involved in the process.  
The citizens of those communities would not welcome federal government interference. 
They would not tolerate it. 
There are several reasons for this.  
As it is almost 2 p.m. I will stop the member here. 
He still has five minutes remaining in which to wrap up.  
We will proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
He truly is one of the biggest little men we have ever known.  
Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will move along briskly from sports to culture. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
I wish the best of luck to the organizers of this great project.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Well, they were wrong.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
The Edmonton Sun says there is a fight on the right. 
The Vancouver Sun says the new political party will be a hard sell. 
The hon. member for Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
The convention was little more than a Reform Party annual meeting. 
The second enduring image left with me was the one of a keynote speaker. 
The Reform Party will stoop to any level to gain power.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
This raises two very interesting questions.  
The Reform Party has now put itself in the same category. 
It is not even a party in waiting. 
Its current occupant appears to have forfeited the category that qualifies him for occupancy.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
It was a weekend to forget 
The Tories said, ``We won't unite'' 
For them, Reform is too far right 
Canadians agree-you can bet.  
The pollsters, the pundits all 
Talked for hours about the call 
From leader to leader it went 
But Joe ignored the event 
On Reform it did cast a pall 
So it's back to the west 
Reform sends their best 
From talk show to talk show 
Their leader did blow 
Now it's back to the board 
For the motley Reform hoard 
Who will search on and on 
For that magic wand 
It's the same old crew- 
A pollster who asks-would you vote for a Jew?  
Reform is Reform-and that's all.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the lights are on at Industry Canada but nobody is home. 
What is the minister's response? 
It is time for the industry minister to- 
The hon. member for Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies.  
SEMAINE INTERNATIONALE DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Especially, when we look at the misleading advertising of the PQ.  
Researcher Jacques Parizeau better go back to the drawing board.  
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
PRESIDENT OF THE QUEEN'S PRIVY COUNCIL FOR CANADA 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
What a fine example of paternalism, arrogance and ignorance.  
This is what has become of federalism- 
The hon. member for Dartmouth.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
To the Prime Minister, the time is now. 
Disabled Canadians cannot wait any longer. 
The disabled are tired of being excluded in this country. 
It is time to exercise their will to act.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
It has already been signed by 134 states.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, who pays some of the highest taxes in Canada? 
Why does the government's tax policy penalize and discriminate against young families?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Those are the people we are helping through this budget. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at the tax position of two families after this budget.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary did not answer the question. 
Can the secretary answer the question?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We have recognized these disparities which occur. 
My colleagues, we all make little errors. 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Why is that the government's policy?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I will go through some of these. 
The tuition and educational tax credit can also- 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Let us see once again if the minister can answer the question. 
Why does this government discriminate against single income families?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is in fact what he said a week ago Friday.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
What is going to happen if we come upon hard times?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a most interesting hypothetical question. 
Our unemployment level is now 7.8%. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That is a good one.  
Has the minister just wakened up?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Now we have a surplus to contend with.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The surplus no longer exists, his colleague the Minister of Finance having dipped into it.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I am not ashamed of what this government has done. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, now there is an interesting suggestion. 
This is the system the French have adopted. 
France's fund is independent. 
I am merely pointing out that now the Bloc Quebecois is singing a different tune. 
We wish it all the best in their evolution. 
It might actually end up understanding our government's economic policy.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we recognize the problem. 
This is more important than photo ops. 
This is something tangible to really help the homeless. 
That is what counts.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, they are not doing anything to help the homeless.  
Homelessness is all around us. 
When will this government do anything to solve the crisis of homelessness?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are concerned with the problem. 
We are working with some provincial governments. 
Some provincial governments are not working with us. 
Also, $12 million from RRAP will be targeted for- 
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, he should tell that to a former solicitor general.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as I indicated previously I do not direct investigations in the RCMP.  
The hon. member for Prince George-Peace River.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
The Court of Appeal of British Columbia will be hearing the case in early April. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Glen Kelly knew he was guilty. 
He knew he did wrong. 
He should have been punished for his perversion. 
The justice system in this country is one of the best in the world. 
We are awaiting the appeal of this case which is coming in April.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the argument is rather bizarre.  
That is not helping people. 
THE CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
The government is consistently attacking the independence of the CBC. 
This is a direct challenge to the independence of the CBC.  
Why is the government trying to create a mouthpiece for the government through the CBC? 
Does the minister know the difference between a state broadcaster and a public broadcaster?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
The CBC is not a Pravda -like propaganda agency for the government. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
Mr. Speaker, this question was fully answered last week. 
I think that people understood perfectly well.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
What is that for, a parole officer?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the laws say that criminals do not sit in the Senate. 
The question is out of order. 
The hon. member for Temiscamingue.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The number of casualties has also dropped. 
What is more important is that basically the export of land mines has stopped.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the solicitor general.  
Can he confirm if these reports, made internally by the RCMP, are accurate? 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Since then additional studies have confirmed the same findings.  
We will look at it, obviously with great care. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We have reached agreement with nine provinces. 
The forms will be on the website at the end of this week. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
He says this is just a small problem. 
Are these small anti-tank guns? 
Are these just small machine guns? 
We are not suggesting that all aboriginal people are involved in this.  
He says that this is unacceptable. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
There are no groups here. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Students in Quebec are extremely important to our government. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Is the federal government currently negotiating with Jean Charest, yes or no?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is what a constructive opposition does. 
He does not have a mandate.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The government believes in and supports the housing industry in Canada.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The question I have for the solicitor general is very simple and very straightforward.  
When will the RCMP act on this issue? 
We need to know when they will act.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is the Bloc that is making a mockery of the National Assembly.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Long term maintenance is a required safety measure.  
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We ensure that we overhaul these aircraft on a very frequent basis. 
There are new engines that are being installed. 
Only when they are safe to fly will they fly.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
The Prime Minister has apologized for that incident. 
Could he give us assurances that a protocol has been developed?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
In any event, the Prime Minister has apologized for any misunderstanding. 
I hope the hon. member will join with me in this prayer.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
In fact they are living in garbage dumps in towns around Ontario. 
I know there is a Gathering Strength document but it is not helping these people. 
They would like to meet with him. 
They have good ideas about how to help these people.

Mr. Speaker, Questions Nos. 84 and 144 will be answered today. 
Question No. 84- Mr. Garry Breitkreuz: 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
He has five minutes remaining in his allotted time.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
These consultative processes are already in place. 
I mention that particularly for my colleagues across the way.  
Various land and resource management initiatives will again proceed. 
Some meetings did take place, however. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Who is being silenced by this, by those 48 votes of closure? 
Who is not being heard? 
Who do the Liberals want to shut down? 
Who do the Liberals want to muffle? 
Who do the Liberals want to stifle on this? 
I will tell members about some of those voices.  
There is authority over zoning and search and seizure. 
They are not getting explanations. 
And yet we are having a third level of government created here. 
It sounds like this Liberal government when it got elected in 1993. 
There need to be consultations, not unilateral actions.  
Here is where we talk about these expropriations. 
A right to expropriation, can anyone believe it?  
One might ask how this government can pass this. 
Usually in a democracy it requires 50% to pass something. 
I guess that is what we would call half a democracy.  
This is pretty straightforward stuff, no unilateral actions, consultations. 
This is not a painful process. 
They only want a little openness and a little explanation.  
I do not think that just sounds incestuous, I say it is incestuous. 
We have serious problems with that.  
That is a very good question. 
How can that happen? 
It is because the Liberals bring in closure for the 48th time. 
That is how that happens. 
I have some more people who are being silenced. 
Those are pretty good quotes. 
``People's property rights are being trampled''.  
```They have to pay fair market value but what will fair market value be?', 
asks Fred Warkentin, a real estate agent with MacDonald Realty''. 
That is a very fair question. 
It is like a government that says it will confiscate your gun. 
Good luck selling it. 
That is property rights.  
Who does this affect? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
We are at report stage. 
Nevertheless, certain points are common in respect to them.  
But I would say again that it is not constitutionally necessary to do that.  
What I am saying is that we are at certain steps along the road. 
We have tried to answer each letter individually and respond to each individual case. 
The message is ``I am still working. 
The book is not closed''. 
This is my comment at this stage. 
I hope to have studied the briefs in great detail, and they do require detail. 
I hope to have more specific recommendations to make. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That is shameful in my view.  
It is one that is very applicable to our situation here today. 
I thought that was a very good principle. 
We need to get things right.  
We need to get it right. 
What is wrong here? 
First, I would like to talk about this process. 
It is a mystery to me. 
Let us bring a solution that works.  
We need to be together on it. 
I worked for a while on a school board. 
I would simply declare the motion defeated and we would go on with our business.  
What do we do here? 
Somehow we have this idiotic process. 
I am not speaking of any individual member, but we have this idiotic process. 
Instead, it is reversed and then we have the government forcing this vote through. 
Now we are not even able to speak on it.  
It is bigger than that. 
All of us have neighbours. 
In my instance I have neighbours from a wide spectrum of national backgrounds. 
What happens if we do not do that right? 
It introduces friction that could otherwise be resolved. 
All we are asking is that we take some very, very simple measures.  
This government could have avoided the embarrassment of the vote at noon today. 
They have done so to a certain degree already. 
We are dealing not only with members of municipal councils who are concerned. 
We need to make sure that we hear them. 
They have some very genuine concerns and we need to hear them.  
It is inappropriate to do that. 
They have to enter into meaningful negotiations.  
I do not believe that is right. 
I urge members to support these amendments. 
Let us listen to each other. 
Let us listen to the reasoning. 
If it is valid, let us make the changes that are necessary. 
Then we will have an opposition that will be supportive of the legislation as improved.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
In fact, it has probably been 30 or 40 years in the making.  
They suffered from that paternalism. 
They all recognized it, and we recognize it.  
They began work on the legislation in 1991. 
The first language of the territory will be Inuktitut. 
Cree will be a language as will English. 
They will start off on this great adventure and I wish them well. 
They have talked about it being slightly flawed. 
I would like to know what legislation introduced in parliament since 1867 has been perfect.  
We seem to think it will be perfection overnight. 
You just don't get it. 
We were the first people here. 
It was our land''.  
The Indians had a communal, co-operative system of government. 
They traded the length and breadth of this continent and the South American continent. 
They were never defeated in battle in this country. 
We need to pass the bill today. 
Members of the opposition worked with me in committee. 
They approved the bill in committee. 
We asked for an amendment which we got. 
A lot of good work is done in our committees. 
We match wits and we deal with a problem before us. 
We came to an agreement.  
I want it passed. 
I want the chiefs to be proud of it. 
I want the 14 nations to get on with running their own affairs. 
I want us to get on with Gathering Strength. 
What could be more important to the aboriginal people of the country? 
I rest my case.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
I will be presenting the problem with the bill in relation to a rural environment.  
It is a shame. 
They cried long and hard. 
This is in fact a move in the right direction. 
I will enumerate the bands within my riding:
He is a fine, articulate native man by the name of Roy Whitney. 
It is a very advanced band with a highly educated administration. 
If it decides to put up an ammunition control facility, it must consult. 
This is not a casual issue but a significant issue. 
There is a boundary fence along the south side of the Siksika reserve which delineates. 
There is a roadway along that boundary fence. 
Would this bill improve that? 
That should be there. 
It could be there. 
It is not a major amendment to have it there.  
The second issue farming individuals will understand. 
No one will cut. 
That has not been envisaged. 
It should not be envisaged. 
I think it would be wrong to go that route.  
I think that is a shame. 
I think it is dreadful.  
I would be profoundly reassured if this bill made that certain. 
The native communities do need to become independent. 
They should not be subservient to the department of Indian affairs. 
My hope is that Bill C-49 will still be altered. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
I come from a riding with 13 Indian reserves. 
They have had numerous town hall meetings and have many issues to be concerned about.  
Currently they are pursuing their case before the Supreme Court of Canada.  
The are not entitled to vote in band elections. 
Where is the fairness in this kind of legislation. 
It is only reasonable. 
After all, this is supposed to be a democratic country.  
This is also seen as an abuse of power. 
Unchecked power tends to abuse, as we all know in the House. 
Today in Canada our system of government follows this model, supposedly. 
It is known as democracy.  
Another thought on this bill is future uncertainty. 
Bill C-49 grants wide, sweeping powers. 
This dynamic evolution of law is a fundamental element of our common law system. 
The catch is that it is perfectly legal.  
On the provisions of Bill C-49, clause 28 deals with expropriation. 
Expropriation can occur for any first nations purpose. 
In other words, it is effectively carte blanche. 
In other words, it can have immediate effect. 
Fair compensation is to be paid along the lines of fair market value. 
In the case of the Musqueam, current FMV is zero. 
And the application of the charter is uncertain. 
I urge all members of the House to support the amendments.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Second, environmental impacts from development on their lands. 
Third, the provision of the local infrastructure and services to their residents. 
Fourth, cross-boundary land use issues. 
I am pleased that the consultation process is already in place. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
I will speak to that in a moment.  
These issues have a potential impact and implication for other municipalities. 
I suggest in many respects that is what we really should have here. 
These reserves should really be municipalities.  
I hear the NDP members talking. 
I am not sure how we intend it to work here and work effectively.  
Archie took his advice. 
Archie went on to become a war hero for us. 
He fought in the second world war. 
My wife and I did not take treaty. 
We have our own home in Beaver Lodge. 
My friends on the Horse Lake reserve are having a great deal of difficulty. 
There is no reward system''.  
Private property gives that reward. 
We take chances in life when we have private property. 
We have a farm ourselves. 
We know that sometimes we make good investments, sometimes we make bad investments. 
We have to move beyond this situation. 
I talked to people who were here from Estonia. 
I suggest there is an analogy here with what we are talking about today. 
It seems to me that municipalities should work together. 
It is a very good amendment. 
I look forward to further debate on the other aspects of this bill later on.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Again we have closure. 
While we are trying to appease one group we may end up victimizing another. 
I am aware that native bands are familiar with this process. 
They have been fighting it for years. 
But this concerns people's lives. 
The natives were angered that $190 million would not go far enough. 
Most people would like to see a better way of doing things.  
We all desire similar things from life. 
There has been a number of petitions presented here with regard to that.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):
Why anyone would be opposed to this is beyond me. 
This bill is about accountability and about fairness. 
This is only a start.  
What this will do is generate revenue through economic development. 
That is ridiculous in the world we live in today.  
Here is a reason why. 
Certainly they may have golf courses and things like that. 
No one should have a problem with that. 
We are trying to get unemployment down, are we not, in all different communities.  
It also ensures community decision making. 
That is where I have a really difficult time with my friends opposite. 
I am getting tired of that. 
Quite frankly, that is total nonsense.  
It does not exist. 
There is no law provincially that says consult. 
It does not exist.  
He does not consult very often. 
He did consult at election time. 
Now first nations people get elected. 
They have a chief and council. 
We will deal with that in a democratic process.  
It looks at first nation communities as municipalities. 
They can be changed by provincial governments whenever they so choose. 
That is a scary sight.  
We should consult because we live next door.  
I do not think it is necessary to put that in the legislation. 
They are more than that. 
They are our partners and we will deal with it in that way. 
This is a great beginning but there is a long way to go. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
We are not in charge of the government's agenda. 
We can only follow. 
There is a certain danger here.  
And right they are. 
It is close to being an embarrassment. 
There are clauses in this act which date back to the last century. 
The act is full of incongruities such as these.  
I referred to the aboriginal schools, but one could also refer to the treaties. 
This has been seen recently with the social union. 
That is how it was in the past with the aboriginal people. 
It is true that the aboriginal people have not been consulted. 
There are Bloc Quebecois amendments on this in the second group.  
We cannot have that.  
They are the victims of a legal void that must be filled. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Let me speak specifically to some of the provisions in the legislation. 
The Liberal government claims to have a social conscience. 
It is unconscionable that the government would leave this to chance. 
Sadly the government sits there and does nothing. 
I know my colleague from Abbotsford will be speaking to this point in a moment. 
In fact natives have seen their standard of living fall. 
We have seen unbelievable levels of alcoholism on reserve. 
We have seen absolutely shameful treatment of natives by this government. 
My friend from Peace River had an excellent suggestion. 
What about adopting the idea of allowing natives to have title to fee simple property? 
This government should do a better job of listening to grassroot natives. 
I think it is ridiculous.  
We see natives in terrible trouble in Canada today. 
Those members should hang their heads in shame.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I certainly hope that is not their hope and dream.  
Someone recently explained to me what the definition of insanity is. 
But such is not the case.  
I have 15 reserves in my riding. 
They say that there is a 99 year lease so it is okay. 
It is not just the Reform Party that is saying this. 
The minister promised him that the rights and interests would be fully protected. 
That commitment was not honoured.  
It becomes an absolute economic life and death issue to the people who are concerned. 
They do not say whatever and take their chances. 
The proof is in the pudding. 
One minister may have good intentions. 
We cannot trust it because that minister may be gone tomorrow. 
There may be somebody else in her place. 
That minister could conveniently forget. 
There could be a regular court challenge. 
Who knows where it might end up.  
That is a shame. 
There are some things we might want to do as a collectivity. 
We might want to have the local arena owned as a collectivity. 
In my province there are particular types of industries that are in decline. 
I was a logging contractor. 
I could give other examples.  
What are they doing with the Nisga'a agreement? 
The government will take the cream of the crop.  
The government will take the prosperous, the growing, the innovative industries for itself. 
We will continue to work on their behalf.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The recorded division will also apply to Motions Nos. 6 and 7. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ) moved: 
``(d) any other relevant matter set out in section 17(2.1).''  
(i) a separation agreement; 
(iii) an order for dissolution of marriage or judicial separation; or 
(iv) an order declaring the marriage null and void respecting the marriage is first made.  
So the women started to show an interest in this issue. 
Looked at overall, this is a major problem for Canada. 
The underlying issue must therefore be settled. 
This could always be looked into.  
No one has been appointed. 
The matter has not been given the importance it deserves.  
That is where the problem lies. 
There is also some danger if this problem is not solved in general terms. 
This is what native women have said. 
We have already questioned the minister on the issue generally. 
They could perhaps test the feasibility by starting with this bill. 
I therefore urge my colleague to support these amendments. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I am glad to see that the first nations agreed to this process.  
The provinces apply the principle of division of matrimonial assets on an equal basis. 
Provincial laws therefore cannot be replicated in their entirety on the reserve lands.  
That has been in the Indian Act and understood.  
Hon. members will appreciate the problem. 
It has to be done in 12 months. 
Nothing precludes a community from addressing the issue at the beginning of the process. 
Federal officials are now working toward the conclusion of this process.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
I have to be careful about the words I use here. 
The parliamentary secretary is wrong. 
This failure to include these protections is very simple. 
These amendments go a long way toward putting those kinds of protections into the act.  
I will read something into the record. 
I am a Canadian citizen and status member of the Squamish Nation. 
This letter comes to you in a state of dismay and disbelief. 
I would urge him to be careful. 
He cannot do it even under the guise of reading from another document. 
He has to be very careful. 
I know he knows the rule in that regard and just forgot. 
Perhaps he will be careful.  
I take your point, Mr. Speaker. 
In this letter, I asked her a set of questions that I thought were legitimate. 
Isn't that a scary thought? 
I urge you to please consider stopping this proposed legislation at your level.  
I have one more letter to read into the record. 
This has to do with the expropriation of provisions of this bill. 
Re: 4314 Staulo Crescent, Vancouver, B.C. 
Your recourse may have little or no concrete effect. 
Also the maximum notice for expropriation is 30 days.  
They are not willing to consider the amendments to protect those leaseholders. 
I say shame on this government. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
A dispute resolution process is also in place should the need for it arise.  
I was at an event in Nova Scotia this morning. 
It is a logging coin. 
My sons are sixth generation on the small farm I live on. 
It is to make sure that they have the ability to do that. 
Prior to this piece of legislation they did not.  
It is a fact the House has to look at. 
It is high time that we dealt with the subject. 
We have ignored it for far too long. 
It is a good piece of legislation and I support it.  
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The rules and procedures cannot discriminate on the basis of sex. 
Individuals can also challenge the rules before a court.  
The communities themselves will decide. 
The minister will make further announcements on this initiative in the near future.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
I just do not believe that they understand. 
The Liberal Party of B.C. is opposed to this legislation. 
I read from the Vancouver Sun of Saturday. 
They know the problems with this bill. 
They have spoken also with the mayors in their areas. 
Some of them have even been to the meetings of the Musqueam leaseholders. 
They know this bill is defective. 
The basic idea of the bill is excellent. 
We cannot pass a bill that allows that to happen.  
That just does not happen at a provincial level. 
Yet her boss knows nothing about the bill. 
He does not understand it.  
The hearings are already done. 
It is all finished. 
That is why the bill needs a requirement for consultation. 
I have had lunch with him. 
We get on well. 
It is a completely different attitude from that of the Squamish band.  
We do not want that to happen here. 
Unfortunately that is the kind of attitude that we are getting.  
It has never happened. 
Why is it that we only have letters opposed to the bill? 
Where are their petitions in favour of the bill? 
How come there are only letters against it? 
Does that not ask a question? 
Could there be something wrong here? 
That comes back to the beginning when I stood.  
The municipalities of the greater Vancouver area are opposed to it. 
They are bulldozing ahead with it.  
It just needs a few amendments.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
It puts the government to shame.  
That is entirely important.  
There will be no legal standard applied from reserve to reserve. 
That might be okay if there were no movement from reserve to reserve. 
We do not think that is right.  
We see the results of family breakdown in cities across the country. 
The need is really extreme. 
Nobody would lose by adopting an amendment like this one. 
The Reform Party will be supporting the amendments. 
They will do the work for the bands that needs to be done.  
In the meantime we have this patchwork legislation. 
What are the values of a community that does not involve children? 
We cannot talk about one without the other.  
They talk about discrimination on the basis of sex, that it does not happen. 
They should not talk to me about that. 
That has been partially given back, not fully. 
I want to raise another issue. 
They should be accepted by people of good will.  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 2 stands deferred.  
The recorded division will also apply to Motions Nos. 3 and 4. 
The next question is on Motion No. 5. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 5 stands deferred.  
And the bells having rung: 
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
(The House divided on Motion No. 1, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 1 defeated. 
I therefore declare Motions Nos. 6 and 7 defeated.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 2, which was negatived on the following division:) 
The next question is on Motion No. 5.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 5, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 5 defeated.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried. 
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The parliamentary secretary's position in my view was quite shocking, quite deplorable. 
Where does the government stand? 
How does it feel about this issue? 
What kind of leadership is it offering Canadians on this matter? 
That is an amazing shift from years gone by. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
At first I thought that she did not understand. 
Now I am not sure that it is that she does not understand. 
I do believe that she is mixing, and perhaps deliberately, different concepts.  
Please stay away from deliberating mixing.  
The provincial government has the responsibility to see how its services are delivered. 
For example, doctors do not work for provincial governments. 
They are not provincial civil servants. 
Nursing homes are sometimes private, sometimes are not for profit. 
The same is true for ambulance services.  
This is called a mixed economy. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
About 80% of the people on that reserve are living on welfare. 
Children are sleeping on mattresses in the basement of burned out houses. 
How does their leadership live?  
I will quote a couple of instances. 
Living conditions on reserves have been historically unacceptable. 
We agree with that. 
If nothing changes, living conditions will continue to be unacceptable. 
In addition to the living conditions that are terrible, the so-called democracy is terrible. 
It does not exist.  
That is one of the purposes of a forensic audit. 
You can find out if all the cheques add up but so what? 
These people are making serious charges. 
I think the money is there. 
The need is urgent. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Those are independent audits. 
In those cases where it does occur it is properly investigated.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.33 p.m.)
