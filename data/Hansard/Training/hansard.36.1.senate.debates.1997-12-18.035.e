Thursday, December 18, 1997 
The Senate met at 9:00 a.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I am concerned about the disposition of that motion. 
The substance of it will have been complied with by what is to follow shortly. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Welcome to the Senate, gentlemen. 
The Most Reverend Anthony Tonnos , Bishop of Hamilton and Chairman for Christian Education:
However, I am very pleased to be here this morning. 
It is the task of governments to help them to fulfil this vital responsibility. 
In our view, public authorities should guarantee this parental right.  
Clause two of the proposed amendment of Term 17 reads as follows: 
Who will teach these courses? 
You diminish its power for children. 
I wish to thank the witnesses for appearing this morning. 
To be perfectly clear, perhaps you would restate your position.The 
The information provided to us from Newfoundland demonstrates a couple of points. 
The majority of Catholics did not vote against denominational schools.  
It is not to say to the majority, "What does the minority want?" 
That is, in fact, what these referenda have done. 
There is not a Catholic majority in the province of Newfoundland. 
The senator made reference to Quebec which I had not mentioned in my statement. 
That essential difference is that, in Quebec, the Catholics are a majority. 
Can you explain that?  
I am not an expert in these questions. 
I suggest to you that that is going on now in the Province of Newfoundland. 
You spoke of love, spirituality and sexuality. 
Usually it is in the senior grades, in the secondary school grades.  
Comparative religion, however, is not what I as a Catholic am about. 
That is what I would want for my child.  
However, the indication that I have heard from the bishops in Newfoundland is twofold. 
If they so desired, the law provides that they can.  
If it is not there, then they can ask for it. 
Thank you for your comments, senator. 
Certainly, I respect them.  
I welcome the bishops here. 
I believe that this chamber is graced by their presence. 
The presence of the bishops before us is indeed historical. 
I have discussed this particular matter with Bishop Tonnos. 
My understanding is that religion must include dogma. 
They cannot be courses in religion.  
Certainly, your statement in regard to religious education courses is exactly precise.  
Your Grace, there are two points by which I am guided. 
One is that minority rights are not absolute. 
Their stated objective was quality of education.  
This is certainly not the case here. 
Just the opposite, I believe, would be true.  
I am not qualified to comment beyond that. 
As a practising Anglican, I am humbled. 
There is no question about that. 
That is what I believe. 
Does it have the right not to be indoctrinated?  
I did not recognize anyone else. 
Senator Pearson, have you completed your questions?  
How can they say no?  
They have cherished and nourished and paid for that system over the past 150 years. 
Why should they reject that? 
I cannot think of any reason. 
Your statement is valid and correct. 
This being the case, the other provinces always base their theses on minority rights. 
In my view, that is true, but there are denominational rights as well.  
Perhaps there is a slight difference in our opinions here. 
I consider that the right to educate a child is also a fundamental right. 
What is left to the state? 
Where does it end?  
We have had that debate for a long time in Quebec. 
There is a distinction.  
I thank you both for being here today. 
I have one comment in addition to the questioning from Senator Carstairs. 
This involves an important issue.  
I wanted to make that point.  
I cannot answer for the bishops of Newfoundland. 
Senator Robichaud ( L' Acadie-Acadia) :
The difference will be a total demise of the denominational school. 
Catholic schools, as such, will simply no longer exist. 
In the other provinces, except New Brunswick, they do.  
Senator Robichaud (L' Acadie-Acadia ) :
Senator Robichaud (L' Acadie-Acadia ) :
I am glad you noticed.  
My question seeks clarification. 
I am trying to discover the real basis of your objection to the proposed resolution.  
I added to that "where it was viable to have a school of that denomination."  
So that it is not a fundamental right, it is a conditional right.  
It is based on the right which has existed historically for that length of time.  
I want to discover what kind of right we are talking about here. 
There are certain rights which philosophers tell us are based on eternal principles. 
The other kind of right is a historic right. 
Those familiar with the common law know all about historic rights. 
You seem to want to have both worlds. 
I think you weaken your case when you try to ride both horses.  
For example, a large minority in Canada practise Judaism. 
I think there is room for improvement in the existing structures. 
Is there any accommodation made now for young Jewish people in Newfoundland? 
I am sorry, senator, I cannot answer that. 
I am not aware of the situation in Newfoundland in regard to Judaism. 
I appreciate the arguments you have been advancing, but it is a changing Canada. 
I wish to welcome you to this Committee of the Whole of the Senate. 
Ms Oonagh O'Dea, Education First:
We represent a group of non-political, multi-faith citizens. 
There are fungus problems at others. 
We want to optimize the educational opportunities and program offerings for the students. 
I am speaking of 14- and 15-year-olds. 
That process is reversed in the afternoon. 
This scenario is repeated throughout the province. 
The Roman Catholics in our province represent 37 per cent of the population. 
We are the largest single denominational group. 
Our children are Roman Catholic. 
Did the voters understand the question? 
Well, the question was quite plain and simple. 
There was ample discussion on both sides of the question through the various media. 
We asked for funding, and they turned us down. 
The religious course would follow the same pattern. 
Indeed, the various religious groups have been asked to provide their input. 
The option is there for children to opt out.  
These councils are legislated bodies. 
As parents, our only concern is for our children. 
In January, we will begin registering our senior high students. 
No one knows where they will go next year. 
It was a good, positive experience.  
All she wanted was neighbourhood schools.  
Can the religions continue to flourish outside the school system? 
Ms Brenda Bryant, Education First:
I should like to clear up a couple of issues that were mentioned earlier. 
The process was seriously flawed. 
My seven-year-old daughter attends that school. 
Most of us were not willing to take that chance.  
Currently, my children play with children in our neighbourhood. 
What do I tell my children? 
People want their children to attend the same neighbourhood school. 
Let them go and play and pray together. 
Let them learn together.  
Thank you for your presentations, Ms O'Dea and Ms Bryant. 
We will now proceed with questions.  
Thank you for your presentations here today. 
I come from the province of Ontario. 
On my reading of the Constitution, that is an important question for us. 
You are both parents of the Roman Catholic persuasion. 
I am quite satisfied that is the case. 
As I said, we are a multi-faith group. 
We had people from all the religions, including the Roman Catholic religion. 
I must say that it is total confusion in our province. 
We have a school board in St. John's East where the board is split. 
There is a greater percentage of Roman Catholics than those of the other religions.  
They cannot make any decisions on the educational issues. 
They are fighting the whole time. 
People are fed up. 
They want to get on with it. 
I, too, would agree with that. 
I wish to give you the opportunity to elaborate on two points. 
The question of timing is definitely important. 
Because of the religious issue, it was reopened. 
We in the west have the opposite experience. 
It seems to be more reasonable. 
In other words, the tax load does not seem to be as heavy. 
Can you put yourself into this mindset? 
We have 87 schools in the Avalon East area. 
Those seven students take up a teaching unit. 
Our teaching units are based on one teacher for 14.5 students. 
Those children could have been accommodated across the way. 
That teaching unit has gone out of a school that needs it.  
We have schools in St. John's that should not be kept open. 
We do not benefit whoever owns the buildings. 
We do not maintain leaky buildings that are 150 years old. 
That is where all our money is going right now. 
This is what we are looking for. 
We are looking for parents to sit on the boards. 
In turn, the schools get a proportion of the money. 
We govern the schools. 
The principal can come to us and we can work together on resolving issues." 
In what way have you come to that conclusion? 
I would like to know a little more about it.  
As I said, I am not a statistician. 
For every 100 Catholics, there were less than 50 "no" votes. 
The numbers were greater in other areas.  
There was no incentive for them to vote "no." 
These areas are very heavily populated by Roman Catholics.  
You said 28 districts. 
That is out of how many?  
They have leaking roofs and asbestos, and anything else you want to mention.  
However, those things do not relate to the set-up of the system.  
Second, I am sorry that you downplay your system. 
I am interested in the wishes of the people of Newfoundland. 
We have heard a good deal about the process of the plebiscite. 
We know the outcome pretty well.  
Did they disregard the views of their electors? 
They certainly were reflecting the views of their constituents. 
We were very pleased to see that they had done so. 
How they may have voted privately, we do not know. 
Thank you for returning. 
That is very important at this time. 
The people of Newfoundland and Labrador voted "yes." 
They knew the question. 
They knew what the proposed Term 17 would be. 
We have a very rich religious background in our province. 
We definitely want religion in our schools. 
Their trust in the democratic process would be, if not destroyed, not far from it. 
I will direct this question to Ms O'Dea. 
You are absolutely right. 
Religious education and the opportunity for religious observances will be protected. 
I should point out that there is nothing prohibiting the establishment of private schools. 
We have, in fact, two religious private schools that are not publicly funded now. 
The Baptists and the Seventh-day Adventists both run their own schools. 
It just does not come out of the public purse.  
I have listened with great interest to the testimony today. 
Across Canada we hear expressions of deep concern about our education system. 
We hear there is a crisis in education. 
I take it that is really the situation, from the testimony that you have given.  
How do you answer this? 
How do you propose that these traditional rights be protected in some form? 
Would time be set aside towards the end of the day? 
Would the right exist that this could even be done?  
How much moral training is given to young people by their parents? 
Do you have any hard evidence of that? 
We have a troubled society, as far as education is concerned.  
Do you think they are doing it?  
I would like to think I am. 
I have raised three kids who are good. 
I think Brenda has raised two children who are good.  
You mentioned the demise of Sunday school. 
Sunday schools go on in some of the churches. 
Some of the Catholic churches have them. 
Let us say that a certain area is very largely Pentecostal. 
There are three bodies involved. 
I wish to welcome the witnesses.  
I have never supported that view. 
That is precisely the system in place in Newfoundland right now. 
My problem is not with the question but with the proposed new term. 
In my opinion, the proposed new term is quite different. 
Could either of the witnesses respond?  
I agree completely that the question was amply debated. 
I may be wrong on that. 
There is a fundamental difference in principle on this. 
I am far closer to the stand of the bishops on this than to yours. 
However, I thank you for your comments.  
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Mr. Minister, welcome once more to the Senate. 
I invite you to make a statement, if you so wish.  
Honourable senators are, of course, already aware of the government's support of this amendment. 
On that occasion, the Supreme Court explicitly stated that: 
With respect to section 93, the court said that: 
Let me deal with this issue now. 
The fourth paragraph of article 18 deals with education. 
I know that the proposed Term 17 specifies that the government: 
...shall provide for courses in religion that are not specific to a religious denomination.  
Therefore, I conclude and maintain that the term is in compliance with the covenant.  
The third paragraph of article 26 states that: 
The second issue I wish to deal with is the consent of the affected minorities. 
The Canadian Constitution is the fundamental law of the country. 
As such, any amendment to the Constitution should be undertaken with great care. 
Change affecting a minority deserves even greater prudence.  
There are many different rights and freedoms. 
( a ) freedom of conscience and religion; 
( c ) freedom of peaceful assembly; and 
( d ) freedom of association.  
As lawmakers yourselves, surely, honourable senators, you know the difference. 
The federal Parliament must take into account the specific context of each case before it. 
In no way do I wish to down play those concerns. 
To conclude, we believe the evidence in support of the amendment is overwhelming. 
Thank you, Mr. Minister.  
To my simple mind, and as Clifford Lincoln said, rights are rights are rights. 
I cannot in my mind make nuances between one being different from another.  
We must balance those rights. 
In fact, in Canada and many provinces, it does not exist. 
Those provinces are still liberal democracies. 
The difference is important.  
It is still a right. 
I think it important that we clarify this point right now. 
I am happy that you do not contest that.  
If it was the tyranny of the minority, the aristocrats would still be in power. 
We must take that into account. 
I will not prolong the discussion. 
They have identified themselves, and they have come before the committee.  
Perhaps the position of the Quebec bishops was a little more conditional. 
In Quebec, they did not have a referendum. 
It was important to know if there was support. 
Therefore, we requested various opinions, and the opinion of the bishops is important. 
Many associations, Catholic and others, support the change. 
If the bishops were in support, I would not be here today. 
You would have voted on this a long time ago. 
You have difficulty because the bishops oppose it.  
There is the unanimous vote in the House of Assembly of Newfoundland. 
You must take it all into account. 
It is specific to Newfoundland.  
I wonder how far we will go.  
I will stop here. 
It was part of the context where there was a referendum.  
It is the same in Quebec. 
It is part of what we have to consider. 
I think we must take that into account. 
It could well be. 
I thank you, minister, and Mr. Chairman.  
Thank you for coming, minister. 
I maintain this is not a fundamental right.  
I am not disagreeing with you.  
You spoke about section 35, regarding aboriginal rights. 
In that way, the Constitution reflects the fact that section 35 is important. 
The second part of your question was with regard to the Pentecostals. 
We have to take into account the different aspects. 
Since they are not easy to identify in the vote, it is quite difficult. 
Then, however, how the Pentecostal members of the House of Assembly voted becomes important. 
I believe that we now have to move on. 
I will support the resolution.  
Minister, please address the question directly. 
It is easy to have a vote. 
After all, the smaller the minority, the more they will be overwhelmed in a referendum. 
However, 72 per cent is a strong indication.  
As Dr. Regular has indicated, we cannot know for certain. 
Surely he cannot claim that his people voted against. 
That means that people were not strongly against the proposition. 
If there is strong opposition, the turnout should be high.  
Do you get the drift of my question?  
Yes, I understand the meaning of the question very well. 
I did not want to ruffle your feathers. 
I will try to dispel that impression. 
It maintained denominational rights that are not maintained this time.  
The two speakers who followed them were also Catholics. 
I have been questioned a lot on this. 
This is another consideration to take into account.  
In a society, I would oppose having just the minorities vote. 
This is not how society is built.  
I have no questions on the merit of the amendment. 
Those who testified before me provided ample proof.  
We have always taken a bilateral approach.  
The situation is probably reversed in all the other provinces.  
In the other provinces, the focus is always on minority rights. 
Religion and religious groups are protected.  
The Archbishop says no, the two people following him say yes. 
If I understand you correctly, you say yes. 
How do you reach that conclusion? 
You tell us the majority voted in favour of the amendment. 
We must look at the context. 
Nothing in the Constitution requires a referendum. 
Nor does anything forbid it. 
The context must be taken into consideration. 
To the best of my knowledge, the vote in Newfoundland was also unanimous. 
Do you have any figures on this?  
Keep in mind that voter turnout was rather low. 
This is a well-known phenomenon in electoral sociology. 
Nonetheless, there were majorities in those ridings with a strong concentration of Catholics.  
For the purposes of this amendment, the matter is resolved. 
We all agree on that. 
Parents are entitled to demand religious instruction for their children.  
I am conscious of the fact that we have quite a list of speakers. 
However, if this is a supplementary question, then the honourable senator should proceed.  
You made the distinction between fundamental and other types of rights. 
They could no doubt try to do so. 
You will agree with me that they nevertheless constitute very respectable liberal democracies.  
It depends on the religious makeup of the society.  
I add my greetings to the honourable minister.  
Section 92 of the Constitution deals with exclusive provincial rights. 
I am not sure that is the right attitude to be taking. 
Now we can see that there was a majority of a minority. 
It will be an awful day when that happens.  
He requested this change. 
Of course, the Parliament of Canada is also the Parliament of Quebec. 
Senators, it is important for you to make up your minds. 
What you are suggesting is the reverse of what the PQ government was saying. 
Yes, we must be suspicious of them.  
I can be suspicious of my friends.  
In my view, the provincial governments are our constitutional partners. 
We must take into account their points of view. 
It is part of the criteria that we must take into account. 
That is quite different.  
I want to work with the provincial governments. 
It revolves around the question of determining the position of affected minorities. 
My memory of that situation is somewhat different. 
He told me that was impossible. 
Subsequently, I heard the same statement made here during debate. 
That was quite startling.  
They had no documentation. 
I asked for some, but none was available.  
I have not heard from him since. 
I am asking you, sir, if you can substantiate that statement. 
It would be much appreciated. 
I contend that we can find no such offer, or proof of offer.  
It is our understanding that it has been offered.  
It is an understanding, but you have no substantiation.  
I just gave you a reason.  
I am not aware of a vote that has been done that way. 
When I go to vote, I do not want to identify myself as a francophone.  
I do not understand the concern. 
In any event, that is secondary. 
It is not my responsibility to devise a system. 
If it is not, we should be very careful about how we phrase it.  
Mr. Minister, you may be correct on that point. 
I am not arguing with that. 
I guess the answer is that you cannot.  
We have every confidence that the results will be what we expect. 
That is a difficult question for me to answer. 
I cannot explain that step-by-step process. 
Unfortunately, I do not have an answer for every question. 
At least two other senators have related their experience in Western Canada.  
It seems that the experience in the west is quite different from that in Newfoundland. 
Many denominational schools are opening their doors. 
Have you looked at that?  
This will be a bilateral amendment. 
That must be very clear. 
The fact that we are removing it from Newfoundland will change nothing in Saskatchewan. 
Sometimes we do not learn a great deal from history. 
I was in New York about three weeks ago. 
It seems that we are moving the other way.  
The relationship between the churches and public life has changed since the nineteenth century. 
It is a debate of public opinion which we may take into account. 
For the Government of Canada, freedom of religion is sacred.  
I should like to welcome the minister here today.  
Yes, I have said that in the past.  
We must be sure whose constitutional partners are the true partners.  
I have great respect for the Constitution of Canada. 
The Senate of Canada has an important constitutional role. 
You are fulfilling your duty. 
I have great respect for all senators. 
I know many personally, and I have great respect for them.  
Can we get back to the matter at hand?  
The resolution before us to amend Term 17 states that: 
...the Legislature... shall provide for courses in religion...  
We are not talking about that today. 
That is not now the case. 
Minister, have you ever heard of Paul Marshall? 
He is at the University of Toronto. 
He had this to say: 
Religious education is the seedbed of religious freedom. 
Mr. Marshall wrote that in his 1997 book entitled Their Blood Cries Out .  
No one is stopping religious education. 
That will exist in Newfoundland as it exists in any other place in Canada. 
You have not persuaded me.  
You could certainly win a gold medal in the Olympics.  
I come at this issue as an Ontarian. 
Would you comment on that? 
Senator, it is most important to take into account the specific context of each province. 
You must take into account the specific context of each province.  
Each context is proper to each province.  
That was 48 years ago. 
The population would not have supported such a change. 
That is not in the spirit of the Constitution. 
When something is placed in the Constitution, we use the word "entrenched." 
It was important for all of us to discuss the merit of the changes. 
The question is more about minority support.  
It was only in 1987 that they received this right. 
We have to change the Constitution according to the changes in society.  
The roots are the same but it changes in different ways. 
The Constitution does not put us in a strait-jacket. 
Minister, thank you for attending and for your thoughtful rendition. 
We are not dealing with fundamental rights in this instance. 
As senators, we must be sensitive to the differences in the Constitution. 
What do we have here in Newfoundland? 
Excuse me, senator, what are you referring to?  
I am referring to the existing Term 17.  
I will now deal with the proposed change in the current resolutions. 
It is including courses in anthropology. 
That is what that means.  
Senator Bolduc, you may be right.  
Let me move to the next section. 
Let us turn to the Oxford dictionary as to what "observances" means. 
It defines "observance" as an act: 
the act or process of keeping or performing a law, duty, custom, ritual 
an act of a religious or ceremonial character; a customary right.  
It is a substitution from one order to another order. 
That is not what the courts have said.  
It sounds like it is what the courts said.  
I think the change requested is overdue. 
It will be good for the children of Newfoundland. 
It will be compatible with the Charter and with international covenants.  
It was run by the Anglican church and paid for with taxpayers' dollars. 
Anglican ministers came in to teach religion. 
They had no rights under the Constitution. 
They had no rights to religious observances. 
However, they will have rights under the amended Term 17. 
That will be clearly set out in the law.  
We are moving to an equality of minorities. 
What we had before was an inequality. 
Term 17 was the equivalent of section 93.  
They continued to operate schools. 
That was set out in the Constitution under Term 17. 
Term 17, therefore, was our section 93. 
It is important to understand that.  
Senator Rompkey, do you have a question for the minister?  
The senator has brought some passion to this debate. 
Many people today have a lot of trouble because of the existing system. 
However, they will be less difficult for most people.  
In addition, every denomination will keep the right to have private schools.  
I also agree with the two witnesses who appeared before us. 
That is not an issue in this case. 
The issue here is the education system for the people of Newfoundland.  
That is not the democracy that I understand we have in Canada. 
It sounds great to say, "Let us find out what the minority wanted." 
I am sorry that I do not have a question.  
I have a comment, Mr. Chairman.  
The evidence I have given to you, however, is compelling.  
Thank you, Mr. Minister, for contributing so much to our deliberations.  
It contributes a great deal to our better understanding of the important issues under review. 
Again, thank you, Minster Dion.  
Honourable senators, do I have permission to rise and report?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the sitting of the Senate is resumed.  
Report of Committee of the Whole 
Your Honour, the Committee of the Whole reports that it has concluded its deliberations.  
Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
Establishment of Fund for Healing Centres-Government Position 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
How will it be distributed? 
These questions must be addressed in consultation with all three of the aboriginal nations. 
They are the Inuit, the First Nations and the Metis.  
Where is our apology? 
This meant that these children were not treated equally.  
My father and my uncle were put into a Blackfoot Indian boys school. 
The Blackfoot and the Cree were always bitter enemies. 
Many of our First Nations women have left the reserves for many different reasons. 
This is not just an issue of abuse in residential schools. 
This generational tragedy must be addressed.  
Honourable senators, I deal on a daily basis with the results of this abuse. 
This is a very serious matter and must be dealt with immediately.  
Rationale for More Investing Abroad 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
That was the simplified version of my question. 
Today I would like to talk of the context in which I placed my question.  
Supply was okay, the banker and the economist said. 
My banker and economist friends say this will affect us.  
How many billions did the Reichmann investors lose? 
Why did the Bramalea managers fall on their face, not they personally, but their investors?  
I am a Liberal. 
I reject all dogma. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does he have permission to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret, permission is denied.  
Fines Levied Under Sign Law 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I wonder what Camus would have made of this state of affairs in Quebec. 
There is one consolation in this curious affair. 
This is, indeed, the festive season and the season of wonderment. 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
UNICEF calls this situation "the silent emergency" because it is largely invisible. 
This situation is largely preventable. 
We have the science. 
We have many examples of best practices. 
What we need is political will.  
Annual Report of Parliamentary Librarian Tabled 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Business of the Senate 
Committee of the Whole Authorized to Reimburse Travel Expenses 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed?  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The reports show that it was only 4.7 per cent.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is a good question. 
I wish I had an equally good answer.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
There does not appear to be anything or any initiative on behalf of visible minorities.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Lack of Visible Minorities Employed in Senate-Government Position 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is another good question. 
That is the third good question in a row. 
This is a problem. 
Alleged Advertising Signs in Corel Centre-Government Position 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
I think it behoves the government leader to explain.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I wish I could explain. 
It certainly is news to me. 
Sable Island Gas Projects-Rumours of Agreements Reached 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
It is a report by Michael Tutton of the Irving Group. 
Michael Tutton, the author, cites another representative of the Irving Oil group who states: 
That's very good news for Atlantic Canada.  
I have defended Irving for the last 25 years. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Simard, could you put your question?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The first sentence reads: 
In answer to the specific question, yes. 
Whether an announcement should have been made immediately, I do not know. 
Whether one will be forthcoming, we will wait and see. 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Does the leader have any information as to what caused that crash? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Bryden for his question. 
As he knows, the government's top priority is safety. 
It is too early to speculate on the probable causes of the accident. 
This announcement should be available for all honourable senators.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we have a delayed answer to that question. 
I am not aware whether whether the workers were transferred. 
What is the policy of the civil administration?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, I will certainly bring that information forward.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Obviously, they have been in touch with the federal government about assistance for this.  
Is the current outbreak under control? 
Does the Leader of the Government have any information available at this point? 
This has just occurred within the last two weeks.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Is the leader knowledgeable about such representations?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, I certainly would be very happy to do so. 
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on December 16, 1997) 
It has also updated a general border alert for illegal importation of this product.  
Employees have grievance procedures available to them which the Department has been following. 
They will be given the Department's decision just as soon as it is available.

I did not get any sleep whatsoever last night. 
It was a sleepless night. 
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Bill 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Is Senator Kirby intending to speak at third reading?  
Then I should like to make a few very brief remarks.  
He said it on more than one occasion. 
We agree with the thrust and necessity for those increases. 
Those were the two remarks I wanted to make. 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
There is another region in this country that might have something to say. 
That is the rationale for the trip.  
I have a question for the chairman of the Banking Committee. 
Yesterday, honourable senators were talking about formulas. 
It is a very expensive area. 
Honourable senators, I do not know the specific answer to the question. 
I have one further point. 
They can afford it.  
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
I spoke very briefly when Minister Paul Martin was here yesterday. 
Minister of Finance Paul Martin did not give me adequate responses to my questions. 
My question is for the bill's sponsor. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If no other honourable senator - 
I asked a question. 
I deserve an answer.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is not Question Period.  
I have been around this place for 30 years. 
Questions in a debate on a motion for third reading are allowed.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, I cannot force anyone to answer those questions.  
Would Senator Kirby respond?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If no other honourable senator - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
This is debate at third reading. 
Your Honour, I rise on a point of order. 
I asked a question. 
In closing, I want to say that I will vote against this bill.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
What is your point of order, Senator Simard? 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
Secretary to the Governor General 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Motion in amendment withdrawn.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted, on division.  
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
This memorandum has been sent to the Deputy Leader of the Government. 
I do know this, however:
It would have been unthinkable not to have heard from him.  
We also heard from Ms O'Dea and Ms Bryant this morning. 
These two witnesses had also been heard by the joint committee.  
The turnout at Newfoundland provincial elections is seldom below 70 per cent.  
Why then have I changed my mind? 
There had not even been a reference to committee at that time.  
This is a good, Canadian formulation. 
It is to be found in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
An injunction was sought and was granted by the courts.  
So, here we are again. 
To me, it is all so unnecessary. 
This is not Northern Ireland we are talking about here. 
However, the blood rushed to the provincial government's head. 
What have we here? 
There now exists a denominational school system in Newfoundland. 
We are being asked to constitutionalize generic courses in religion. 
There are bound to be challenges under the Charter.  
We have had two referenda, two resolutions and two debates. 
If this goes through, we will have had two amendments to the Constitution. 
It will become an annual event. 
They accuse us of possibly creating chaos! 
In fact, they corrected my earlier impression. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave?  
I thank honourable senators. 
I will not keep you long at all.  
What would we say about such a situation in Manitoba? 
I do not even want to contemplate it. 
Honourable senators, I leave it at that. 
These are small minorities that we are talking about. 
The Pentecostals are 6 per cent of the population in Newfoundland. 
They have 13 or 14 schools. 
They have only one school.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I have done my own soul searching.  
We have been sent a clear and very strong message. 
Do such circumstances exist? 
Let me take a moment to review some of the more controversial issues.  
Honourable senators, let me read to you the question that was put in the referendum. 
I find it difficult to imagine a clearer way to put the question to voters. 
Canadians take elections and referendum votes seriously. 
We must take their decision seriously.  
There have been suggestions that, perhaps, a majority of Roman Catholics voted against the referendum. 
I am a practising Roman Catholic. 
I have the highest regard for our bishops. 
Honourable senators, I do not know how individuals voted. 
A secret ballot is a fundamental part of our democratic process. 
However, there are certain things that we do know. 
Those are very solid majorities.  
That was five years after the Constitution Act, 1982 passed. 
The Constitution says what it says. 
We cannot abdicate our responsibility by unilaterally amending the amending formula.  
How would determining minority support work as a practical matter? 
What of Newfoundlanders who are Muslims, Jewish or Buddhists? 
What are we saying to them? 
Honourable senators, that is not the Canadian way. 
I believe that we now have to move on. 
He has changed his mind. 
Senator Petten supports the proposed amendment.  
They believe it is now time to change their system of education. 
They want one system where, in Premier Tobin's words: 
Honourable senators, these are values that I respect. 
These are values that I believe Canada stands for as a nation. 
That is what the people of Newfoundland and Labrador have voted to support. 
It was written by a teacher, Elizabeth Noseworthy of Mount Pearl, Newfoundland: 
I realize that some Newfoundlanders are worried about what the new system will mean. 
It is about trust and belief in one another. 
How can we accept it in our own?  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
I think he called it a "religious error."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion please say "nay?"  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, honourable senators, the "yeas" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The vote will be held a 3:35 p.m. 
Motion agreed to on the following division: 
Bill to Amend-Order Stands 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
On the contrary, it is very important. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I do not know whether or not this is a point of order. 
It is my fault; I did not watch the clock properly.  
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee Adopted 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee Adopted 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Hon. Jean B. Forest :
After this week, I guess I am still wondering. 
I jest, of course. 
It is a wonderful opportunity.  
Alberta's Famous Five have long been an inspiration to me. 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
They should be recognized amongst other great leaders of our nation.  
She has a slogan which I follow faithfully. 
I recommend it to all of you. 
Just do the thing and let them howl!  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I, too, should like to rise on this matter. 
Many Canadians were doing exactly the same thing. 
There is another Manitoba connection, Senator Spivak.  
Regrettably, many of the men who were leading governments in those days shared those views. 
We have every right to be proud of her for that particular reason.  
Emily Murphy was a dyed-in-the-wool Tory.  
Nellie McClung was equally a dyed-in-the-wool Liberal. 
They disliked her intensely, but she was true to the cause. 
These were special women, but they are representative women. 
They challenged Emily Murphy in her very first day in court. 
I agree there were many privileges that women had achieved long before this particular case. 
I went to her home. 
My daughters say some day there will be a mother-daughter combination in the Senate.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I have a brief intervention for the record. 
I should like to suggest, though, that I would support everything that has been said. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I should like to join in this celebration today. 
It is a celebration of effort and contribution. 
Ontario deserves more female representation in this chamber. 
I congratulate each and every one of you who has spoken on this item. 
Hon. Gildas L. Molgat :
The Senate appointed a woman Speaker before the House of Commons did so. 
We we were also first to have a woman whip.  
The Senate has every reason to be proud.  
That is something we should strive for. 
We have three women and three men. 
We are moving towards equality.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I will not take the time to repeat them here.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Or else not go home.  
I understand Frances Wright is in the gallery. 
Perhaps we could acknowledge her presence.  
Frances epitomizes the drive and energy of these five famous women. 
Maybe I did not get that close; I do not know. 
Her daughter was a great tennis player and used to always beat me.  
There is no reason why they should stop at that. 
We must reconstruct the system. 
This is just the beachhead. 
I look forward to one of my daughters replacing me.  
Thank you for the opportunity to say something on this matter. 
The Famous Five were certainly outstanding people. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
( a ) the natural resources of Canada are the property of all Canadians; 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
There was an agreement among Canada, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. 
The pipeline was coming and we went to look at the site. 
As I said, I was a member of the delegation. 
In fact, I have a picture to prove it. 
This was a quite an experience for us.  
They were doing an environmental assessment of the route. 
Therefore, there was no point in them coming before us.  
This project was very important to New Brunswick at the time. 
It meant thousands of jobs. 
Therefore, Senator Simard has a point.  
I know that cost is important. 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
I am not denying the competency of the National Energy Board. 
I would have liked to propose an amendment. 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
I listened to and appreciated her comments. 
I realize she did not move an amendment. 
My assumption made sense this morning. 
I cannot question the decision made by the government and Cabinet.  
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
I hope you will rule my point of order as admissible. 
I was sincere and I kept my word. 
I am asking Senator Carstairs to give us her reasons.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, but this is not a point of order.  
Could Senator Carstairs give me an answer? 
She can make a voluntary statement. 
This is a case of double-cross on the part of Senator Carstairs.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
To use such terminology does not reflect respect for honourable members. 
You were sitting in your chair.  
That did not, quite frankly, constitute any form of agreement. 
He made a statement. 
I made no reply to that statement.  
I will remember this day, December 18, 1997.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Somehow they have also ended up with the pipeline.  
That is a very unusual situation indeed. 
We have the joint public review panel report into this area. 
Admittedly, TransCanada and the other competitors come in awfully late. 
I would like to wrap my mind around this problem. 
We have agreed to cut our carbon emissions. 
Really, we must do so some pretty intense thinking. 
We are selling it to the Yankees so they can cut their emissions. 
Something has gone wrong here, somewhere.  
Quebec exports electrical power all the way down from the hydro projects. 
No one has considered these issues.  
Everyone has been asking only one question. 
Include the Kyoto agreement in the analysis. 
Instead of developing a petrochemical industry in Nova Scotia, we are exporting it. 
Someone must draw this whole picture and do some sort of economic planning. 
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
Hon. Eugene Whelan , pursuant to notice of December 17, 1997, moved: 
Honourable senators, this motion has been seconded by Senator Spivak. 
This has not been granted to them.  
Remember thalidomide as an example. 
The reputation of Canada's purebred dairy cattle is world recognized. 
No scientist can say that that practice can be guaranteed safe.  
We are asking for a one-year moratorium. 
Perhaps that is what we should be asking.  
Well, senators, it is not okay. 
Honourable senators, I ask you to endorse this motion.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Spivak, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Michel Cogger , pursuant to notice of December 17, 1997, moved: 
Of course, we have this vacuum. 
I thank you for your attention and wish you all Merry Christmas. 
If the helicopters should land upon us, perhaps we will see you sooner than February.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
We do our best, but we do not handle them.  
The Canadian military gave us specifications for the equipment they needed. 
In their judgment, it was the best we could get. 
The second was ship-borne replacement of the Sea Kings. 
One piece of equipment would be interchangeable and interoperable. 
The equipment the military recommended has a good reputation. 
They never get into trouble in convenient places.  
We have put this decision off for five years. 
That is too long. 
There are questions that must be debated. 
Senator Phillips raised that proposition a week or so ago. 
Something must come into place. 
They will make do; I know that, but that does not make it right.  
The $500 million was only the cancellation fee. 
Up to that point, we had paid half a billion dollars in progress payments. 
The cost was up to $980 million - virtually $1 billion. 
The costs caused by this delay are well over $3 billion.  
There are more costs to taxpayers from further delay. 
In addition to that is the cost of fuel for training.  
People's lives are what are fundamentally at stake here. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
( b ) determine an appropriate date...  
This particular motion is a directive to the Speaker. 
Honourable senators, this motion was never ruled out of order. 
More important, the very nature of the motion - 
Honourable senators, I have not agreed to take any questions. 
I have moved the adjournment of the debate.  
Senator Cogger, Honourable Senator Carstairs has moved the adjournment of the debate.  
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
That requires unanimous consent.  
A motion for adjournment is incorrect.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
How would we like to vote on it? 
We will just defer the vote until tomorrow night! 
Do we want to vote on it at 5:30 p.m. tomorrow?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
In my opinion, the "Yeas" have it. 
The motion is carried.  
Committee Authorized to Travel 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Leave having been given to Revert to Routine Proceedings: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
THE HONOURABLE WILLIAM J. PETTEN 
THE HONOURABLE M. LORNE BONNELL 
Hon. P. Derek Lewis :
I should like to say a few words in that respect, if I may.  
We are long-time friends, as are our families. 
I appreciate being associated with him over these years. 
He has been a great representative of our province. 
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
The House of Commons having been summoned, and being come with their Deputy Speaker. 
The House of Commons withdrew.  
His Excellency the Governor General was pleased to retire.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
- a very happy and healthy New Year.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Best wishes for the New Year.  
Senator Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Merry Christmas to you all.  
Hon. William J. Petten :
I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. 
It has been great being with all of you all these years. 
I move that the Senate do now adjourn.  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, February 10, 1998, at 2 p.m.
