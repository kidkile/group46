GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
This is a very comprehensive and important report. 
Some of the recommendations will be acted on. 
We have been dealing with this species recently. 
I ask that all here today make time to see that display today.  
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
FOOD AND DRUGS ACT 
This bill is my effort for the 36th parliament. 
It is much more sophisticated than my previous bills.

Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
There is another point.  
They were clearly thought out. 
These amendments were not controversial and should have found very wide support.  
It includes maximum penalties. 
We in the Reform Party support that kind of approach. 
This was our opportunity to do something about it. 
The government in its wisdom saw fit to include maximum sentences. 
We should also put in more parameters for judges. 
The range of sentencing is astronomical. 
They agreed that it made a great deal of sense. 
We would like to support government legislation. 
We had another amendment to bring in. 
We have to be careful now that we include women. 
There is a caveat that says that certain people will not be eligible. 
We think that in itself needs to be addressed. 
What was the response of government members in this regard? 
The government states that it wants to make homes and streets safer. 
British Columbia is a big province as is the province of Ontario. 
British Columbia is a very big, rugged province. 
That is the exception that is allowed. 
He is part of the government. 
It occurred and they reported it on Monday. 
The RCMP got to it on Thursday. 
That is not acceptable.  
What is getting tough on crime? 
It is not prostitution. 
What can I say? 
What is a member of parliament? 
Do I belong to the government? 
No, I am not a member of the government. 
I do not want to be tied that way. 
Am I a government representative? 
I am not even a Reform Party representative. 
I am a representative of the constituents of my riding. 
The Reform Party is the vehicle I use.  
What is interesting is the scheduling. 
I do not think Canadians can take this government seriously.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
This is a major ongoing concern and it is not going to go away.  
In actual fact, none of this was created by them.  
For example, there was a multiple murder in my riding. 
One case like that can put the taxman's budget well over. 
We cannot plan for contingencies like that. 
These are major investigations.  
The public is becoming more and more uncomfortable. 
Basic policing is something that government should be providing. 
That is a prime responsibility. 
It is affecting overtime monitoring, our helicopters, our boats and our airplanes. 
It is affecting capital spending. 
It is affecting the future of the RCMP. 
The training centre in Regina is now shut down. 
It is affecting morale on an ongoing basis. 
This is just not acceptable. 
That is my comment.  
This makes it very difficult. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for raising these points. 
First, it is what the RCMP relies on to get coverage. 
I think it is absolutely shameful. 
The government wastes phenomenal amounts of money. 
How does the government respond to that? 
It closes down the training centre in Regina.  
No new people are coming on. 
The government says it is a temporary measure. 
I went through this in the air traffic control system. 
The government was running it at the time. 
The government said ``Gosh, we made a mistake. 
We have a problem in this country. 
The trouble that we have today is temporary. 
It is not going to stay like it is. 
It has no plan for making our homes and streets safer.  
We have to wonder. 
The government should be ashamed.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I must say at the outset that there are some positive aspects to this bill. 
Some of these measures indeed have been long in coming. 
It is refreshing to see that these changes will be enacted.  
It could have delivered much more and there was an opportunity to deliver much more. 
That is to say, it did not go far enough. 
We have no bill as yet to replace the Young Offenders Act. 
That is a shocking statement from someone in that position. 
I would embrace it as a positive measure.  
This is a positive change.  
I might suggest that a hybrid type of sentencing option might be more appropriate.  
I do agree that the initiative taken by my colleague is a good one. 
Another is stopping the clock on conditional sentences. 
It would begin on the offender's release. 
I commend this as a positive change to the Criminal Code.  
The judges may, in their wisdom, decide that these type of sentences are not appropriate. 
If it is there, the lawyers will ask for it. 
That is the way the system works. 
It is something that should not come as any surprise to us. 
Why not simply remove that type of discretion for certain codified offences?  
We need to send a stronger message when it comes to violence. 
There is in fact a review taking place. 
Recognizing this and doing something about it are two different things. 
Resources of course are a problem that the government is wrestling with, its priorities. 
Where does it spend the money? 
Where does it cut the money? 
There was an international report tabled, ``The International Narcotics Control Strategy''. 
I express guarded support for Bill C-51 on behalf of the Conservative Party. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his comments.  
It is something our law enforcement community has certainly expressed its opinion on.  
Surely we can do more. 
Some of these children are as young as 11 and 12 years old.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It was drawn to my attention by a letter I received yesterday. 
However, the topic I want to discuss is the transfer of money. 
Of course we have this argument that surely people should have the choice. 
I will give a little history. 
Probably about 30 years ago I met a friend. 
He met me in the hall of a building and he looked both ways. 
As a matter of fact, I did not consider it. 
We could talk about the mathematical aspect of gambling. 
I had the students compute the probabilities. 
They might wait for 26,000 years, on average, if they spend $5 each time.  
All of these schemes indicate that there is a reasonable expectation of winning. 
Otherwise people would not put their money down.  
There probably will not be too many poor people on them.  
It is just indefensible in our society.  
Then there are these absurd conditions. 
They must be on the ship. 
As well, the ship must be at least five nautical miles from a port.  
We have been cutting RCMP in the west. 
We do not have money for it. 
Now what are we going to do? 
They have to leave the country for a while. 
That is the height of absurdity in my humble and unbiased opinion.  
I shake my head and wonder how the Dickens we are going to enforce this.  
I shake my head in wonderment at the government sometimes. 
Why should we be encouraging and permitting lotteries? 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Does he ever think, for instance, about the city of Windsor? 
What is his problem? 
Is the Reform Party writing Windsor off too? 
The hon. member mentioned the jobs that will be created. 
There is no value attached to that.  
I also agree with freedom of choice. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
All of that requires enforcement.  
What are my colleague thoughts in this regard?  
I was very young at that time. 
It used to be that we did not need drivers' licences. 
We did not need to license our vehicles.  
Now we have to buy drivers' licences and automobile licences every year. 
We have come to accept that. 
Those are the real issues of justice that we should be concentrating on.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
We only see pictures of someone winning a million dollars. 
They do not show poverty. 
They do not show marriage break-ups. 
Mr. Speaker, that is my point exactly. 
That is the expectation and and it is false. 
It is an outright lie.  
Yes, it is false advertising.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The House has heard the proposal of the chief government whip. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
I believe you would find consent for the following motion: 
The hon. member for Vancouver East is here and consents. 
The House has heard the proposal of the chief government whip. 
Is there unanimous consent of the House to propose the motion?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
I am sure I speak for all of us here today when I say this.  
I can only regard them as either blind ignorance or outright hypocrisy.  
There is no constitutional basis for this at this time.  
There is a process for dealing with this problem. 
The problem will never end for these people. 
Shame on a government like that, shame on this government. 
This raises an important point about the concept of self-government.  
We only ever hear the exact opposite. 
But these are only superficial and empty words. 
Does it only hear what it wants to hear? 
This should not be. 
Listen to what some of them have said. 
What has happened to us has been passed down through the generations. 
Do you think money is going to heal us? 
Only the Creator can do that. 
It is going to go to drive the Indian industry. 
The chiefs, the government and their lawyers are the only ones who will benefit. 
We must make sure that our rights and freedoms are protected. 
We must stop this cycle of desperation''.  
The supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law are at issue here. 
Essentially there are none and this is wrong. 
This legislation is found to be flawed on these grounds alone.  
However, I wanted this issue to go on the record today.  
But again, self-government is not the real problem. 
But I wonder if the minister really knows what that means. 
We would see a different kind of action and not just words. 
Clearly this is the way things appear to be.  
This is what I would call extreme, extreme injustice. 
This is what I call extreme inequity. 
Fourth, lawful obligations must be recognized. 
What has changed since then? 
I submit that very little has changed. 
At the time he said: 
I remind the House that those words were spoken in 1969. 
It must be all Canadians, non-aboriginal and aboriginal together willing equality. 
One people, one vision and one goal: one Canada, equality for and among all persons.  
Making things right is never easy. 
With this legislation the government is at another crossroads. 
But I wonder, does it have the moral fortitude to choose the right way?  
The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development needs to be significantly restructured. 
These treaties have not been negotiated in an open, public manner. 
If it were only that easy. 
Inequality breeds injustice, suspicion and prejudice. 
I know this is clearly not what the majority of Canadians want.  
Why can Canadians not refer to themselves as a people? 
Why can they not do the same? 
On the beach behind us, 
Canadians gave their lives 
So the world would be a better place.  
In death they were neither anglophones nor francophones, 
not from the West or the East, 
not Christians or Jews, 
not aboriginal peoples or immigrants.  
This government must regain sight of this vision of Canada. 
It is impossible to move ahead while dwelling on the past. 
A weak and halting apology has been extended. 
Forgiveness, however grudgingly accepted, was given. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to move: 
We said that gathering strength was about addressing the needs of communities. 
We said it was about building a real partnership with aboriginal people. 
The bill before us delivers on that vision. 
It is about putting the daily management of their own affairs into their own hands. 
In other words, it is about empowerment.  
The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples recognizes that complexity in its own report. 
The Indian Act is paternalistic. 
First nations authority will apply on first nations land. 
First nations will control the issues of leases, licences and other interests in their lands. 
However, at the same time it may withdraw that right at any time.  
Some have wanted, for example, to develop forest companies. 
Those decisions ought to be made at the local level.  
This is what the framework agreement gives them the authority to do.  
We look forward to making a further announcement on this initiative in the near future.  
Most of all, this legislation will benefit the first nations themselves. 
The leaders led this process. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
We had been talking about this bill for a long time but nothing was happening. 
We are very happy to have the bill now before us.  
In Saskatchewan, we have the first nations of Muskoday and Cowessess. 
In Manitoba, we have the Opaskwayak Cree. 
In New Brunswick, we have the first nation of Saint Mary's.  
Of course, it would be very difficult to scrap this act.  
No, you cannot sell cattle.'' 
At the present time, however, that is the way the act is worded. 
According to the details we have at present, there was such consultation. 
These nations are fully in favour of Bill C-49.  
I find the reaction of the Reform Party rather disappointing. 
There are just as many of them off reserves as on. 
Autonomy can take several forms. 
Self-government is often mentioned. 
Native people see it all very differently. 
They see it more collectively, with the land belonging to everyone. 
I also told you I would get back to the issue of marriage breakdown. 
This is an important issue for aboriginal women. 
The case has not yet been heard. 
The bill is currently under consideration. 
As I was saying, this does not apply on the reserve, however. 
In so doing, the minister acknowledged the existence of a legal vacuum. 
Therefore, I ask her to act quickly regarding this issue. 
Now, several months later, that commission has not even begun its work.  
The approach is innovative, and concerns land management. 
So this bill puts paid to injustice. 
The government is trying, clearly. 
That period is over.  
The bill also contains provisions for environmental assessment plans.  
The land code will resolve this.  
There were several negotiations. 
It seems like a relatively long time. 
It has been an on-again, off-again process. 
Ten years is quite a long time. 
This is a bill that leaves participation optional. 
There are several ways this could come about. 
As I have said, it could be through self-government and land claims. 
They are the ground-breakers, the ones that decided to move ahead toward self-government. 
First, there are the Siksika, of Alberta. 
The reserves are getting over-crowded. 
This is what has happened with the Siksika.  
Their language is part of the Algonquian family of languages. 
They administer a number of programs. 
Theirs is a beautiful area. 
This situation continues to be of concern to them. 
I feel this would be in the best interests of both aboriginal people and whites. 
For them, there is the concept of sharing. 
They subsequently divided into three separate bands. 
The reserve was confirmed with the Williams treaty of 1923.  
This big reserve measures some 1,951,000 acres. 
On two occasions they gave up part of their lands. 
Their reserve, like the others, was confirmed by the Williams treaty in 1923.  
The Ojibways may be found in Ontario, in the great lakes region. 
I will shortly be speaking in a few aboriginal languages. 
I have asked for the translation of a passage I particularly wanted to read. 
A number of communities have sent remarks, which I will read, along with their translation. 
I raised the problem of marriage breakup. 
Mrs. Derrickson is Robert Louie's mother-in-law. 
This first nation is situated in the Okanagan valley.  
I wanted to say, in various native languages, what our wishes for aboriginals are. 
Since I have eight minutes left, I think I can manage.  
I have four translations to read. 
Member spoke in Cree ] 
Member spoke in Salishan ] 
That is why each translation takes a little longer to read.  
The Objibways sent me a translation of the same message. 
Member spoke in Ojibway ] 
``Mnaabmewziding'' means ``good luck''.  
Member spoke in Ojibway ] 
Finally, I wish them good luck in their new venture.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Before resuming debate, I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Saint-Jean. 
It is very difficult to speak other languages.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
These social problems are wounds that still have not been healed.  
But Reform's true intention toward the first nations is clear. 
Reform's real intention is the assimilation of the first nations. 
That is why Reform constantly tries to undermine first nations governments.  
Traditionally the Dene were a nomadic people and followed the caribou herds.  
Besides these tragic social consequences, another outcome was that the Dene people were divided. 
I am looking forward to addressing this shortcoming when the bill goes to committee.  
This is far from the case.  
There is also a chronic shortage of qualified health care professionals.  
This report paints a distressing picture. 
The impact on health in these first nations is massive. 
There are still many wounds to be healed.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I believe she believes that what she is saying is correct. 
Certain statements were made to Reform, its right wing agenda and its friends. 
I am not sure who she was talking about. 
She may have her terms of reference a bit out of whack. 
I will give an example of the real issue. 
I will stand behind my party's position and my own position. 
It is time the government does that. 
It has been a long time coming. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Nobody ever challenged the status quo. 
Members of my caucus and I are pursuing these things with vigour. 
We are challenging what is wrong and we are starting to see major fixes. 
In many respects I am quite sure they do not. 
Some of them may not at all. 
In many respects there are objectives in the legislation which I find admirable. 
If the member wishes to comment on my comments, she is welcome.  
Mr. Speaker, nobody is opposed to all the things the member mentioned. 
That has been the problem for too long.  
That is the truest strong change. 
That has been how democratic governments have progressed.  
We sit here and complain. 
I tried to indicate that when I commented on patronage. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
It is partly because governments did not listen to the people. 
The Reform Party is committed to that.  
I have some 26 first nations in my riding. 
I know that all other first nations will do the same. 
I believe that with my heart and soul. 
I know that is the right way to go for aboriginal people.  
The first nations people have the right to make that decision. 
This is the best move for them. 
They have discussed it in numerous communities. 
That is what is needed for all first nations. 
The hon. member mentioned women's rights. 
They have that support and they will continue to have that support. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I will discuss them in greater detail later.  
I congratulate the 14 first nations that are signatories to the framework agreement. 
Thirty or forty first nations have already expressed an interest in the framework agreement. 
This agreement however is reserve specific, affecting only the bands listed in the agreement. 
In summing up I would like to add a few points. 
This bill is about the whole concept of land ownership. 
These are all things that private ownership takes for granted. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of comments and a question.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question. 
It is a legitimate question. 
This is the case.  
I used fee simple because fee simple is what most of us understand. 
However, the idea of a common ownership of land is not completely foreign to us. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk about fee simple ownership. 
The band had a business proposal that included all of the land. 
After several years it is now one of the major developments. 
It is a major shopping area in the community and serves the whole community. 
It is highly successful.  
That is the upside. 
The downside is that there are taxation ramifications. 
Philosophically I agree with that.  
They can incorporate that. 
They have a system of government which has worked for a great deal of time. 
Things may change in the future.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Bill C-49 is the result of native initiative. 
Provisions have also been included to address the concerns raised by native women.  
Once again we hear the word partnership from the minister. 
Some of us will remember that the chiefs reacted negatively. 
I think we have come a long way from those days. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I would like the member to comment on that.  
There is another issue I would like the hon. member to comment on. 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member's comments. 
I served on the yes committee in my riding for the Charlottetown accord. 
I think it said far too much and was very unclear. 
Many people did not understand what it was getting at.  
I share the member's concern.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
I have news for the member. 
On investigation, however, some of them proved to be not very well founded. 
NATIONAL CRIME PREVENTION WEEK 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
My community of the Waterloo region has been a pioneer in this area. 
Crime hurts people and makes them feel unsafe. 
It decreases quality of life and changes the face of our communities.  
The evidence is conclusive.

Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
I am proud to offer my best wishes.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Helicopters and heavy equipment must be barged down. 
All must be acted on now. 
Act now and we can save lives. 
Procrastinate and people will die.

Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
I am proud to participate in Veterans Week. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Juliana's beauty is much deeper than her appearance. 
Here is just one. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, clearly Mr. Bouchard is caught in his referendum.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Too many are closing.  
These museums play a critical role in maintaining our heritage. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Given this fact, every community, including my riding of Markham, has been affected.  
Many harmful myths exist about those who are affected by Down's syndrome. 
It is time to realize that these myths are wrong and destructive. 
The fact is many individuals with Down's syndrome are productive, happy members of society.  
I am honoured to- 
The hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton.  
ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCE CANADA 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
But ministers recognize that no single group can win this battle alone. 
Oral questions, the hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We are willing to give the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt. 
We do not think he was trying to mislead the House. 
In fact, we just think he happens to be living in a fantasy world. 
He has imaginary homeless friends. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Twelve million Canadians do pay EI taxes and they are getting pretty sick of it.  
When is he going to let them keep it?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Is that the position of the finance minister and the Prime Minister? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Millions of Canadians pay into this fund and in fact overpay into this fund. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, members of the opposition can repeat the same question time and time again. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I would ask the hon. member to withdraw the word misrepresent.  
I withdraw that comment, Mr. Speaker. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I guess we know the answer to that one.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister surprised us again yesterday.  
He is not the only one either. 
Several of his ministers were unaware of the fact as well. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is certainly our intention to lower them in future.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It is profoundly immoral to protect one's ships rather than unemployed workers.  
What kind of study is this gang of incompetents doing?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Minister of Finance has the floor.  
And all this is because of the good management of this government. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
It is clearly stated on page 47 of the study you commissioned- 
The figures provided on page 47 are wrong.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
These are the people they are talking about. 
Seventy-eight per cent of workers are covered; that is the real figure.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The Liberal Party of Canada is responsible for medicare. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The minister claims that he views privatization as a threat. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member does not know what she is talking about. 
There are two ways to kill medicare. 
This government knows how to do it. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I have a question for the solicitor general. 
Who are the government lawyers taking their instructions from? 
What is the purpose of continuing this charade? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We want our complaints heard.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am surprised the hon. member is asking this question today. 
We had two hours in committee yesterday. 
They did not violate any federal-provincial agreements.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I ask hon. members to be very judicious in their choice of words. 
I will let the hon. minister answer the question.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That will not happen.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Reform Party simply refuses to understand the true reality of the Canadian economy.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is absolutely not the case, Mr. Speaker. 
We know what a team is. 
We are a team and that is the advantage of working as a team. 
We could show them.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in 1993 two Canadian soldiers were killed while on duty in Bosnia. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think cheap is correct. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, 40 other officers and soldiers witnessed this horrible sight.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
What he is doing is casting aspersions on a senior officer of the Canadian forces. 
I think that is shameful. 
Any of these accusations will be looked into.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
That is what they want.  
Let us look at the figures. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
He was casting aspersions on the minister and the government.  
Yesterday the minister said he cared about military personnel. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the matter of pensions is a matter of privacy. 
It is a matter that is before the Department of Veterans Affairs.  
As to the other allegations, those are matters that are being looked into. 
I do not rely on what members of the Reform Party say. 
Most of the time they get it quite wrong.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
The minister ought to know that. 
He has had 24 hours to look into this matter.  
There are 3,200 other soldiers at least who were exposed to this radioactive waste. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again those are allegations. 
I believe they are creating unnecessary harm. 
They are fear-mongering and creating harm for our armed forces personnel. 
Without the evidence they are just shameful allegations.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
We are all aware that technological innovation is essential to this country's economy. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The RCMP believes the commission is biased. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We will not do it.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
He set up a toothless commission without real court powers to look into it. 
When are we going to get an independent judicial inquiry from this government? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the real question is:
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
This is a real crisis that demands immediate action. 
I do not believe farmers can wait until the February budget.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Today the deputy ministers are meeting. 
The next steps will be taken. 
We are addressing the problem of farm incomes.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
There have been over 100 suicide attempts since 1992. 
It has been two months and he has heard nothing.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Related fraud cases are costing Canadian taxpayers millions of dollars. 
Not one department is willing to take responsibility for SIN reform. 
Not one department has given the taxpayers a timetable for the completion of this project.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
One will be involved in cleaning up the registries. 
They keep those registries. 
We need that information.  
We are already working very hard at improving the security features of the card.  
We are making major improvements in this area. 
To do a better job we need the assistance of our colleagues in the House.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have considerably stepped up our efforts in this regard.  
We have invested $300 million in the transitional jobs fund. 
The hon. member for Bourassa.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
I will let that question stand, but we are getting close.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The truth is that Health Canada- 
I wish we were playing horseshoes. 
The hon. minister is now even.  
We made the results of that research available to other departments. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That will require a very different technology. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the health minister.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Etobicoke Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The hon. member's problem is being addressed through that process. 
In due time I think he will be very pleased with the results.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
But Canada will continue to take its own actions. 
We will continue to reduce levels of mercury. 
The hon. member for Vancouver East.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
I will save it the time.  
Two hundred thousand Canadians are homeless. 
The lucky ones find temporary beds in shelters. 
I would ask the hon. member to withdraw the word hypocritical, please.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Federal ministers are looking at the matter. 
They are working on it with provincial counterparts. 
It goes beyond the words of the hon. member. 
I cannot say they are hypocritical because the Speaker- 
I ask the hon. minister to withdraw the word hypocritical.  
I certainly do, Mr. Speaker. 
They have devoted their lives to enriching our cultural lives in Canada.  
There will be a reception for this group in Room 216. 
I invite all of you to meet the recipients.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is no doubt the best question asked today. 
Next week is a recess week for Remembrance Day. 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The report recommended standing order changes regarding Private Members' Business.  
I argue that recommendations Nos. 3, 5, 7 and 8 should be implemented immediately. 
These changes are very briefly as follows.  
That person or persons will be provided with sufficient staff.  
Recommendations Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 6 would require standing order changes. 
I will comment briefly on these changes.  
We are sort of getting into the debate and the explanation. 
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. 
The circumstances today are identical. 
We are coming up to a break week. 
The cabinet has absolutely no say in this matter of Private Members' Business.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief and address the point. 
That is what I understand his point to be.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
It was approved by that particular committee and tabled in this very House.  
It was nowhere near surreptitious.  
I would support the Reform Party's move on the basis of those particular points.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
This is a decision that has been made by this House. 
What the government is doing is wrong. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
At another time ``misrepresent'' could be taken that it is a very serious accusation. 
That has always been left to the Speaker to decide.  
Sometimes I will ask for a withdrawal. 
Witness the word ``hypocritical'' today. 
I would prefer that these words not be used.  
On the other hand what are you to do? 
I guess that is the best I can do to give you direction on that. 
Good luck the next time that you use it.  
A final point of order, the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
That did in fact take place.  
I take that as a question of clarification and I am going to permit it. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I hope that this is some clarification.  
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there are some legitimate concerns about Bill C-49. 
Guess who were the loudest complainants and the ones that got this travesty stopped? 
It was the native women. 
We find native women. 
It excludes any discrimination flowing from the Indian Act. 
That is a big problem. 
It does not protect native women from many of the things they are complaining about. 
They cannot win if they have everything stacked against them. 
I will quote from the letter: 
In order to do that it goes through great gyrations. 
When governments certify ethnic or racial status it can become very complicated. 
I does not matter who designs the system. 
It tends to be stacked against Indian women. 
It is also stacked against others.  
It is an inappropriate way to do things.  
It is an artificial definition. 
All their initiatives are still being milked. 
There are no original ideas. 
There is no new direction. 
It is apparent that is what is needed.  
Further, the bill we are dealing with right now dates back a number of years. 
It seems like that is always the case. 
We all know that there is very enlightened band governance in Canada. 
We could all name examples. 
That is what we are trying to change. 
In actual fact we are finding out that is what people want. 
I have some very major concerns about the bill. 
This is very troubling, especially from a local perspective. 
That is where everything happens.  
It died and has now been resurrected a year later. 
This was my critic area in the last parliament. 
Everyone knew the June 2, 1997 election would be called in April. 
The department of Indian affairs works in mysterious ways. 
The government gets stampeded by internal lobby groups. 
They all try to infect the opposition with a sense of undue haste and urgency. 
It is piecemeal, partial, non-satisfactory legislation.  
Another concern I have is about the leaseholders on reserve lands. 
That could really be considered a form of expropriation.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
We talk about the community consultation review process and the impacts of that. 
B.C. native women are concerned about what happened to the results of the process.  
It really did not want anyone to discover what all of those things were.  
The department started a cover-up operation a long time ago. 
It is a bureaucratic response to a problem. 
It would happen in every organization where there are no checks and balances.  
There is no other department with a mandate for activities on the reserve. 
This has become a very large problem.  
We are now developing some ad hoc mechanisms. 
This is all brand new and it took five years of tough fighting. 
An awful lot of people put themselves in a very susceptible position.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just want to help the hon. member a bit. 
There was an advisory group on three separate occasions. 
Mr. Speaker, I am aware of how the government pays lip service to consultation. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
We tried to introduce legislation addressing this issue in the previous Parliament. 
It was introduced in its new form as Bill C-49. 
I am pleased that we are prepared to go ahead with second reading today.  
Control of the decision-making process will therefore enable them to improve management of reserves. 
We are worried about one aspect in particular, and it concerns protection of aboriginal women.  
An independent inquiry is therefore set to study the matter.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  
I am now prepared to explain how the Chair will proceed on this matter.  
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I had reached the point of discussing the rights of aboriginal women. 
I was saying that these were treated as secondary.  
Family legislation in the various provinces does not apply on reserves. 
This is a source of considerable concern, in my opinion.  
It is the same for basic environmental issues. 
The environment and natural resources are integral parts of native culture. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
People are suffering from enormously. 
There are high rates of substance abuse and suicide attempts. 
The soles of communities are being torn out. 
Grassroots aboriginal people are dislocated from their political masters. 
Let us invest in aboriginal people to help them help themselves. 
It does not entail separate development. 
It does not entail a lands claim process. 
The essence of bill says ``You are aboriginal people. 
You are different from non-aboriginal people. 
Therefore you are going to be treated differently''. 
They merely want equality. 
Again, I implore the government not to treat aboriginal people differently. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
They are still in poverty. 
Stripping away their constitutional and land rights I would suggest respectfully would be disastrous. 
It has been disastrous for 100 years. 
Rights are given to a collective in aboriginal groups. 
They are not given to individuals. 
That is part of the problem. 
The individual aboriginal person does not have the same rights as a non-aboriginal person.  
I know he has experienced this himself. 
Aboriginal people off reserve are sustaining horrendous circumstances. 
They do not have the tools and abilities to fend for themselves. 
Billions of dollars are put into those reserves. 
The money is not getting to where it is supposed to go. 
I suggest that he find out where that money is going. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
There were others who stood.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
No, that is not the order. 
Mr. Speaker, I understand what you just said. 
However, if it is the same individual, does it still apply in that case?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The answer is yes it does. 
In response, the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.  
They have begged her for answers. 
All they have got is the cold shoulder.  
While that is happening, those people are living in third world conditions. 
People are committing suicide. 
Find out where those resources are going and do these people a service.  
Mr. Speaker, this is quite an interesting debate.  
It is expanding that to aboriginal communities outside reserves.  
We support those initiatives. 
That is what is happening.  
Meet with those people. 
The solutions are not difficult. 
Some of these solutions require that paradigm shift. 
We will certainly benefit from that.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
I congratulate them for their vision and determination.  
Those wheels turn slowly.  
Registration of leases takes six months to several years. 
Sometimes they are lost and have to be redone. 
The money from such leases are tied up without gaining any interest.  
We need control of pollution, of our water and a recycling system. 
We need some of our people trained to safeguard this area. 
We have many fruit trees which need to be cared for to be productive.  
I have many friends there. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
The aboriginal head start program is a good idea. 
It made good television. 
Where are the children who need this program? 
Where were the Liberals when those people were telling their stories?  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:
Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted to tell the hon. member where I have been. 
I have been in the community of the Chippewas of Georgina Island. 
That is not what I have heard the Reform Party purports to believe in.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
They are being locked into it by the style of negotiations taking place. 
There is no other explanation for what is happening. 
That is the situation in these settlements as they take place. 
Individuals do not have property rights. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:
This legislation puts control and decision making in the hands of aboriginal people.  
They then have to ask for their own money back. 
This is an insane situation. 
I hope the hon. member understands that.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want to enlighten the House on a bit of history.  
The member mentioned the Chippewas. 
The Chippewas of Sarnia have a different story to tell. 
It might be a lesson for hon. members.  
The financial institution in turn called on the collateral. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:
It is time the government lives up to those commitments. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
All the land was aboriginal land. 
Aski-kahna means what is left of the treaty obligation. 
It is like a corral. 
The traditional lands beyond the reserves have to be considered. 
I think the bill does not address that. 
It only addresses the administration of lands.  
It is still under the Indian Act. 
I will use Cree to explain to them what my thoughts are.  
Member spoke in Cree ] 
Member spoke in Cree ] 
A very crucial definition of the Metis comes into play. 
There is a huge dilemma with that definition. 
The term first nations does not cover every obligation with all people. 
There are Metis and Inuit. 
It is all for administrative purposes.  
Member spoke in Cree ] 
I understand the makings of the law.  
Member spoke in Cree ] 
In Cree we have a name for the Constitution.  
Member spoke in Cree ] 
This is the highest order of the country's definition of the law. 
However there is a dilemma. 
We have certain parties that would like first nations to be municipal governments. 
Are they the third level of governance?  
There is no higher level of accountability at their levels. 
Nothing has been designed.  
Those two will have to come into play.  
Member spoke in Cree ] 
Until then it is taken over for another purpose.  
Land opportunities have been mentioned. 
Specific statements have been made. 
The system of governance will have to evolve. 
The system of administration is evolving.  
They travels, take jets to Ottawa and negotiate. 
We should not knock them down. 
They have adopted a first opportunity to administer Indian affairs regional departments. 
Let us look at tribal councils. 
We are finally seeing aboriginal people making decisions. 
We should not knock them down. 
We should give them a chance.  
We live on a huge piece of land but we have problems with housing. 
Many northern communities have housing problems. 
It is the economic cycle.  
Hudson's Bay is still an economic, capitalistic process. 
It does not share its capital with its people. 
It is an opportunity to address these issues.  
That concern has been raised by a number of people.  
Member spoke in Cree ] 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
I just want to commend him on mentioning seventh generation thinking. 
We should be far-sighted.  
We should be establishing laws that make a difference. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
That goal is long overdue.  
If we can correct that it will be an achievement. 
I am particularly concerned with clause 37. 
I have heard a lot of others say they are concerned with the same clause. 
My colleagues and I recognize the need for effective self-government. 
This division is unacceptable.  
Not only is it creating divisions, it is promoting an ``us against them'' mentality. 
Those things are denied. 
That is only one example of the problem that may arise from enacting this legislation. 
There are all kinds of problems. 
They want exactly the same things the rest of us want.  
I see it all the time. 
It will never change. 
These things happen every day. 
People talk to me about it.  
She enjoyed her job. 
She was well educated and she was good at her job. 
She witnessed the abuse and corruption on her own reserve. 
When she complained her life was threatened. 
The stories go on. 
The RCMP said it would begin a criminal investigation. 
I can go on and on. 
There are endless stories such as these.  
That is the message being sent to me all the time. 
The truth is there are no polls reflecting the views of grassroots aboriginal people. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Does everybody understand the law?  
The B.C. Native Women's Society certainly does. 
It understands the implications of this law and opposes it. 
Do people hear both sides of the debate?  
They want control over their own lives.  
That is not what aboriginal people want. 
They want control over their lives just like we have.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I take this opportunity to say that I fully extend my sympathy with them. 
They were not recruited. 
I have some of those veterans of the Indian ancestry within my constituency.  
I have talked to many of them. 
We allowed white people, caucasians, to come in. 
I want to say this to correct a wrong. 
We simply prolong it. 
This is what my colleagues and I agree on fundamentally.  
In 13 months we are facing a brand new millennium. 
It is time we got with it. 
This bill will not do that. 
The Indian Act today does not do that. 
It is not only one call; this goes on and on.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House resumed from September 25 consideration of the motion.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is not true. 
I state unequivocally that this is also a priority of our government. 
Third, there are Canada study grants to help those in need. 
For example, students with disabilities face multiple issues relating to access.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I would like to read the motion: 
I understand the motion. 
The issue is an extremely valuable one to discuss. 
If that premise is true it certainly would need to be addressed very clearly. 
Should the student pay any of the costs at all? 
Another question comes to mind. 
There is an anomaly here. 
That is something to address as well.  
That is not going to be of great excitement to most students.  
Those are the issues we need to talk about in this debate. 
I commend the member for bringing forward this serious issue. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Motion M-132 reads as follows: 
Quebec already has a program for providing financial assistance to students. 
This comprehensive system was not created yesterday. 
It aims to have Quebec's consensus on the matter respected.  
This consensus is not surprising. 
Where education is concerned, Quebec has its own developmental tools. 
It has had promising results as far as accessibility is concerned. 
In other words, we know how to manage education. 
That is particularly clear in the case of the millennium scholarships.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
I would like to dedicate what I have to say today to three young women. 
These are the people I am thinking about when I talk about this motion.  
The Liberal government has called itself the government of youth. 
This motion attempts to rectify this injustice. 
We want the government to listen to what the students are saying.  
They really are handicapped by the schedules of others. 
Deaf students in Ontario have recently found their grants turned into loans. 
It can reach up to $60,000 per student.  
I want to put forward some facts about post-secondary education. 
Currently we have 130,000 students in default. 
The number of bankrupt graduates is estimated at 37,000. 
There is a legacy. 
I really cannot get that out of my mind. 
The implications to that are staggering. 
Who is to say which guidelines cabinet will set? 
For example, how profitable is it to get an education in the arts?  
Why does business want in? 
Big business has taken note. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
I am confused by the wording of the privatizing of Canada student loans. 
Their families worry about it. 
Graduates must deal with it''.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I would like to just briefly summarize why this motion was brought forward.  
We do need accessibility as a national standard. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.18 p.m.)
