The House met at 10 a.m. 
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1998 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The minister will be taking part in a CEPA debate on Monday.  
We have much greater insight into the stresses that humans place on the environment. 
We know more about what must be done to reduce and remedy these stresses. 
Legislation must reflect the growth and change of society. 
CEPA must reflect the awareness and concern of Canadians.  
These interactions are key to our continued health and existence. 
An ecosystem approach is an integrative, transdisciplinary approach. 
Protection and amelioration of the environment demands this integrative and transdisciplinary approach.  
The costs of inaction are simply too high.  
Good environmental practices make good business sense. 
Canadians want a healthy environment and they want to be involved in the solutions. 
Government alone cannot be expected to protect the environment. 
The new CEPA seeks to improve opportunities for public participation. 
This inventory exists now on the basis of a policy decision. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Reform's position on the environment is very clear. 
This is the key to protecting our environment. 
It was also aimed at enabling Canada to fulfil international obligations. 
That is quite an expansion.  
There are many areas in this bill that Reform supports. 
In speaking today there are four major areas that I want to discuss. 
I will start off with the jurisdictional issues.  
Federal-provincial co-operation is essential to ensure environmental policies are carried through. 
This is a start. 
Furthermore, Bill C-32 creates a national advisory committee. 
I have talked about the jurisdictional issues. 
I am now going to talk about public consultation.  
Some of the issues concern the public consultation process. 
Access to this registry should be open and the form clearly announced.  
These are very common sense things.  
The third area I want to talk about is science.  
This is not always the case with the present government. 
This section has now been amended. 
Yet it is defined in the section on controlling toxic substances. 
This was a major concern in the last parliament. 
Without that all else fails.  
The Reform Party has many clear positions on enforcement. 
Yet this has proven to be quite the exaggeration.  
That is quite a commitment to the environment.  
What must be emphasized, however, is more than enforcement. 
The operative word is compliance, not enforcement. 
Compliance is number one. 
That applies to all legislation in the House. 
The business community certainly knows about natural incentives.  
Recognition of voluntary instruments has also been added. 
How does a bureaucrat cut red tape? 
The answer is lengthways. 
There are still areas of concern that need to be worked out. 
We had the recent example of the fiasco over Kyoto. 
We do not need another one of those. 
We had no cost benefit analysis, no idea of how to get to our commitment. 
It is sort of like make it up as we go along.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
A short-sighted view will not enable us to solve these problems. 
We must treat the environment as the limited and unique resource that it is. 
We must treat human life like the fragile thing that it is.  
Let there be no illusions about this. 
There can be no quick fix. 
There will be more crises, more ecological accidents. 
These are just symptoms of a larger problem.  
In this respect, we are witnessing a real revolution in attitudes. 
They choose health over the pursuit of economic expansion at all cost. 
These new values are priorities. 
This government cannot be satisfied with reacting to environmental crises. 
This is my view of Bill C-32. 
Economic development must not jeopardize the planet's natural balance. 
The misunderstanding does not lie at this level. 
The difference resides in our identifying with distinct peoples. 
We want to acquire as many tools as possible for orienting our development.  
Paralysis and uncertainty were the poisoned fruits of this inability to live together.  
For a long time these scientists and ecologists were reduced to preaching in the wilderness. 
There is no lack of examples. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Once again, this decision widened the gap between two blueprints for society.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
How can an opposition motion ever cause a vote of confidence in the government? 
Why is the government putting its politics before the needs of these victims?  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
In fact the bridge has become an attraction in itself. 
But we are not yet satisfied. 
The industry this year is aiming for 1.4 million visitors.  
I can assure them they will not be disappointed.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Research shows that children learn better on a full stomach. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, volunteers open doors to a better world. 
That is the motto for this year's National Volunteer Week.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Fifty thousand never returned to their homes. 
Our country was third in allied military might. 
Canada's factories built 17,000 planes. 
Now we belittle our proud war effort. 
Quebec ought not drop the torch. 
Quebec must hold it high. 
All three must be remembered. 
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
This group opposes the protocol.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, hepatitis C is a killer disease. 
Its victims suffer and die. 
Blood is not for sale in Canada.  
Canadians trusted our government, but our government failed them.  
Then the government made another mistake by not compensating fairly all the victims. 
The hon. member for Mississauga Centre.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Tobacco addiction is a major public health threat. 
Tobacco use is an addiction that is almost always acquired in childhood. 
We have an opportunity to prevent some of the 40,000 annual tobacco deaths. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Unfortunately, the government opposite has always refused to recognize the Armenian genocide. 
Yet, the facts speak for themselves. 
Today, along with the Armenian community, the Bloc Quebecois remembers.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
This grim anniversary is an important reminder to all of us. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
However, the Croats had different plans. 
They attacked Canadian positions with heavy artillery and machine-gun fire. 
The Canadian soldiers returned fire to defend themselves. 
One unit came under repeated attacks but held its ground. 
I would encourage MPs to attend to hear their remarkable story.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
The Government of Canada stood behind that guarantee of safety. 
Now it is time for the Government of Canada to make good on our guarantee.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
The federal government is in a bind. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister knows that is simply not true. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, last month the minister- 
Helping hurting hepatitis C victims is one of those issues. 
Why will he not allow members of parliament to vote their conscience?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this vote is not a vote for anything but for the victims. 
The only person who is trying to raise the stakes is the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We should not be making it a political issue?'' 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the premise of the hon. member's question. 
We are confident that we will win the vote.  
The hon. member did not deal with that point and this speaks for itself.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have already answered yes to this question.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
The rate of assimilation in Saskatchewan is assessed at 71%.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
It is impossible to hear the hon. member.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Those discussions are ongoing and would be put into effect for- 
The hon. member for Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
This should not be a political issue. 
This should be an issue of principle. 
Why does the Deputy Prime Minister not take muzzle off his colleagues? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we need to address this problem. 
Almost every member of the House has rural communities that are dealing with this issue. 
It is a problem that crosses party lines.  
Rural firefighters across Canada deserve the same benefits as urban firefighters. 
This Liberal government has refused to assist in addressing this problem. 
They can only give them a small contribution. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
It is government policy that infected them, not fate.  
He is a lawyer. 
Can he not see the difference?  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
It is an accepted part of life. 
It is the government's fault because it refused to screen the blood.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I repeat what I just said to the member a moment ago. 
The hon. member for Matapedia-Matane.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the reply, but it is no answer.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
What is my constituent supposed to do to look after his children today? 
What will become of his family in the future?  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
All of them did that in partnership. 
The hon. member for Wild Rose.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
It would have been taken care of.  
This young man in my constituency wants to know what he has to do. 
Does he have to resort to begging, selling pencils on a street corner? 
He cannot get unemployment insurance. 
He cannot buy life insurance. 
How can they sit over there and not offer some alternatives? 
Does he suggest they sue the government? 
Is that the only alternative? 
Come up with something better.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
It would be more helpful to recognize the fact that there is something available already.  
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Mr. Speaker, the ruling was published yesterday. 
The government has 60 days in which to respond. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this lacks conviction.  
Let us see some conviction, please.  
Again, in this case, the ruling was handed down only yesterday. 
We are going to study it and, within the 60 days, make a satisfactory reply.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Several million doses have already been cleared as safe. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our approach is to ensure that Canadian forces personnel are protected. 
Certainly not by the Reform Party.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
My question for the Minister for International Trade is quite simple. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We will continue these efforts.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. 
This government takes its responsibility seriously. 
I hope that attorney general also takes his responsibility seriously.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
It is obvious that these discussions are not getting anywhere. 
The situation is worse now than before these discussions. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The hon. member for South Surrey-White Rock-Langley.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, he is quite correct that the senate judiciary committee did approve it. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We are working on the second question the hon. member is referring to. 
The United States government is sovereign. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Continued dependence on this product could be hazardous to your health''. 
Hepatitis C victims learned that the hard way. 
Now young people and old people are in peril. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member has tried to confuse several issues here. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
I am sorry about that. 
The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
The agreement has been finalized. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This is good for tourism and it is good for the economy. 
It shows how this government is committed to putting funds into Canada's highways.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There is still time to realize the objectives he has raised in the House.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
More than 400,000 Canadians have been taken off the tax rolls completely. 
This is what this government has done for Canadian taxpayers.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
The owners of these plants were treated like criminals. 
People in my region want to know what is going on.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
The government spoke about the need for early action. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
We will be active.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government recognizes the enormous potential that there is in electronic commerce. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the ice storm was in January. 
He is still waiting for a response. 
Why is this minister stonewalling western farmers- 
The hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no double standard. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I believe you would find unanimous consent to the following motion.  
In other words, it will take place around 7.00 p.m. 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
If the House gives its consent, I move that the report be concurred in.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
The petitioners support the development of a bioartificial kidney in Canada. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
The hon. member has a problem. 
They are not up for discussion today.  
Mr. Speaker, I will raise that on Wednesday.  
I would like to know from the parliamentary secretary when I can expect a response.  
I am simply trying to save the time of the House. 
Is it agreed that all questions stand?  
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT 1998 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
What is the purpose of this bill? 
There is a broad range of such substances. 
We are in favour of including the Native peoples in the environmental assessment process. 
What powers will the renewed CEPA delegate to Quebec and the other provinces in Canada? 
This case has always been contested by Quebec. 
Bill C-32 also contains a number of new features. 
The provinces will advise the federal minister through a national advisory committee. 
The bill also includes provisions relating specifically to aboriginal governments. 
In addition, they must be consulted with respect to all environmental matters affecting their territories. 
Up to six representatives will sit on the national advisory committee. 
This registry will complete the 1993 National Pollutant Release Inventory.  
As regards pollution prevention, this issue will become a national objective. 
It incorporates the power to limit engine emissions. 
We have touched on some of the aspects of this bill. 
That is what the Bloc Quebecois deplores.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The book provoked controversy. 
The book was Silent Spring by Rachel Carson. 
It is a practice few countries embrace by deed or implement by actions. 
The environment and human health cannot be considered as separate entities. 
They are tied together as one. 
A healthy environment provides healthy living. 
Why do we need the legislation? 
We were being poisoned. 
Our children's future was being compromised. 
The polluters polluted; the victims suffered and died. 
All species suffered: the wildlife, the flora and the fauna.  
The next Plastimet will be someone else's travesty. 
The Swan Hills plant will continue to spew poisons. 
What is wrong with this Liberal picture? 
Its report entitled ``It's About our Health:
Pollution Prevention'' echoes Ms. Carson's Silent Spring . 
There are however bad apples.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Chris Axworthy):
The hon. member for Fundy-Royal.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
It is an extremely complex piece of legislation. 
That will be our role in committee. 
There are a couple of areas of concern to me. 
First is the issue of pollution prevention. 
However I am concerned about the consequences of this commitment. 
Has the government thought it out? 
How much will it cost? 
How detailed will it have to be? 
Will it be the same for small business as for big industry?  
Any kind of environmental legislation must be based upon science. 
The government should be applauded for this very prudent initiative.  
We talk about the Progressive Conservative Party. 
One such area is a prudent approach to science. 
We believe categorically in the science of climate change. 
The Progressive Conservative Party believes the bill is important. 
It was brought forward by the Hon. Jean J. Charest.  
So inspections can be done, but violations cannot be enforced. 
That is the intention of harmonization and that would be a good thing. 
The federal government is getting out of the environment business. 
It is abandoning its role as a setter and a guarantor of national standards.  
It is not just New Brunswick. 
The environment is a shared jurisdiction. 
Each applies and enforces laws and regulations according to their needs. 
With 100 clauses the government is making a major commitment to enforcing CEPA. 
That is the record of this government. 
The Mounties would be going after polluters.  
This is a bizarre situation.  
This means that by default the task in enforcing CEPA will fall to the provinces.  
These statistics are very sobering; indeed, alarming. 
These statistics are indeed sobering. 
I would like to point one thing out. 
High debt levels actually affect our country's competitiveness to be able to compete. 
Then it comes to establishing our priorities. 
This particular clause makes me very uneasy. 
That is why this bill is so disappointing. 
We will have to look at in terms of what comes out of committee. 
It is a more workable bill than Bill C-74 was. 
It is our cornerstone bill of legislation with respect to the environment. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated my Conservative colleague's presentation. 
We also agree on the federal government's inability to resolve the problem. 
I think that we can agree on that.  
Does the Government of Quebec have jurisdiction?  
The harmonization process and the agreement were quite clear. 
Today, the government brings in Bill C-32. 
Every aspect of this bill is set in a national context or spirit.  
I have a simple question for my colleague from the Conservative Party. 
Canadians believe that the management of the environment is a shared jurisdiction. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
That is my concern. 
How will they succeed in doing this? 
Will there be an environmental police on the highways? 
That is impossible, because they do not have the means to do it.  
I do not know whether my colleague has any comments in this regard. 
Let us look at the broader picture and cut in financial terms as well. 
I would like to hear what my colleague in the Conservative Party has to say.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the question. 
That said, I fundamentally believe the environment is an area of shared jurisdiction.  
The hon. member touched on a couple of points. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
My question relates to the member's comment. 
Mr. Speaker, the short answer to that question is absolutely no. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
The basis for economic progress is wealth creation. 
This is not a bottomless treasure trove. 
They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature''.  
You lived through it as a young person in university. 
You earned quite a name for yourself in this regard. 
In 1988 the Canadian Environmental Protection Act was launched.  
But we recognize that governments alone cannot solve the problems. 
The present Canadian Environmental Protection Act includes participation rights. 
It was also the case for concepts such as globalization. 
Today, the world is smaller. 
No country can live in isolation, particularly when it comes to toxic pollutants.  
Canada must be ready to face the challenge of globalization. 
The proposed new CEPA gives a very clear and certain sound. 
Canada needs this legislation for the 21st century and beyond. 
POLICE AND PEACE OFFICER NATIONAL MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC) moved: 
In particular Scott Newark has assisted me in my efforts in bringing this motion forward.  
That situation changed one tragic summer night in 1977. 
After the salute, one brass shell case was saved and mounted on a commemorative plaque. 
It is certainly hoped that great care will be taken.  
Sombre but telling words. 
There is no consent.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
That memorial takes place on the last Sunday of every September. 
Responding to crime and criminal behaviour is no easy task. 
It means focusing correctional resources on those who need it most. 
This is demonstrated on a number of fronts. 
It is essential in order to build an effective and efficient criminal justice system.  
The record on public safety speaks for itself. 
Fourth, we will continue to take tough measures against violent and dangerous offenders.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
As members know, I am a former police officer in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
The Bloc Quebecois enthusiastically endorses this motion and will support it.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
I congratulate the member for bringing this matter forward. 
That is a financial question that most members of the House would support. 
However it is not what is being asked today. 
The motion does not ask the government to provide funds. 
Canadians would wonder why.  
Neal Jessop, president of the Canadian Police Association, said: 
It is a duty and commitment of all of us. 
They will stay forever young in memories, but we will not forget them.  
Surely all of us in the House share those words and sentiments. 
His name was Brian King. 
It is not enough to say that and go no further.  
Surely the member for Nunavut is not opposed. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
More important, it brings us all together to thank them for a job well done. 
Unfortunately this has not yet been the case.  
I have firsthand knowledge about police service in Canada. 
Again I have been intimately involved with that.  
This government will continue to make public safety its priority. 
This is demonstrated on a number of fronts. 
The record on public safety speaks for itself.  
This government supports Motion No. 342. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would just like to make a couple of brief comments.  
However, this is not the time nor the place to debate that issue.  
Fortunately, for most people, that is their only contact. 
However, I have a personal connection. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We have also heard mention of ill conceived gun registry. 
I am disappointed and saddened by the position taken by the Liberal members opposite. 
This is not a vote of confidence. 
There is no consent.  
(The House adjourned at 2.24 p.m.)
