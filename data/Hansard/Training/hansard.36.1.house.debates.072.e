EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 72 
Thursday, March 12, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1998 
STATUTORY PROGRAM EVALUATION ACT 
Mrs. Ayotte enlisted the support of a large coalition of organizations and individuals. 
Her petition against violent toys has collected 260,000 signatures. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
No further meetings have been held since December 8, 1997.  
At this time no further meetings are scheduled between the parties.  
The issuance of cheques will be automated to the extent possible. 
Departments are also doing some preparatory work to accelerate the issuance and delivery of cheques. 
Cheques to former employees will follow. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The operator centre for this system is located in Ottawa. 
The traffic for this service is carried on the Government Intercity Network. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ): moved: 
This action translates into a net loss for the Quebec education system. 
Is this what students really want?  
Why did the Liberals create this millennium scholarship fund? 
I personally asked the Prime Minister what he had had in mind. 
They are going to know it in this case, you can be sure. 
The government wants to gain visibility at the expense of debt-burdened students. 
Did Quebeckers see through this scheme? 
As we can see, Quebeckers are not fooled by the federal government's manoeuvres. 
Maple leaves were good in Nagano. 
Why not put the money towards the existing Canadian Student Loan Program? 
Why create something entirely new?''  
Quebec is not the only one to say what we are saying today. 
I support this generation which, in fact, is my generation. 
The dumping of responsibilities starts here, with the federal government. 
As a society, we have to ask ourselves some tough questions.  
We have to ask ourselves some tough questions.  
Let me tell you how I see things. 
These are the facts confronting my generation. 
It is urgent that we answer this question.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member.  
Mr. Speaker, one thing seems rather obvious. 
Is it an agreement or an intrusion to gain visibility? 
It is making no bones about what this is all about. 
But what is at issue here is cost-effectiveness. 
Education is an investment. 
That is my answer. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is the fundamental essence of the Canadian millennium fund. 
If what we can achieve with values is visibility of values, why not do that?  
Mr. Speaker, I want to make one thing clear. 
There are maple leaves everywhere in Quebec. 
I have nothing against the maple leaf.  
In our province maple leaves grow on trees.  
They die in the fall.  
Yes, they die in the fall.  
My objective is efficiency. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
That is precisely why our motion refers to national testing. 
It only makes sense that it be in charge.  
This is yet another blatant federalist contradiction.  
We do not know. 
It will therefore have to put in place a new bureaucracy. 
That is the first impact.  
Perhaps some elements should be consolidated. 
Perhaps there are other priorities. 
The drop-out rate is high at the secondary level. 
It would be better off if it sent 100,000 individual $3,000 cheques instead. 
The maple leaf and the federal government would be visible all over the place. 
This is obviously nothing but a political game.  
I would like to come back briefly to the spending power. 
Over the years, this spending power has become the power to get into debt. 
The federal government stepped in when it did not have the money to do so. 
It has invaded provincial jurisdictions on borrowed money. 
Now that we have a balanced budget, I bet things will only get worse. 
I will have the opportunity to come back to this later today. 
I am talking about Alain Dubuc, editorial writer of La Presse . 
What does he think about this? 
This is what a Quebec federalist who usually supports the central government said.  
Now, let us see what the people in the education area had to say. 
They only had to dump it onto the people below them''.  
That sums up the political ploy very well. 
In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment is in order.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
It is on page 79 of the 1998 budget plan.  
There is nothing to fear.  
Mr. Speaker, that question allows me to deal with another aspect of the issue. 
Of course they knew what they were talking about.  
They make me laugh with their speeches on flexibility. 
These are the words of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
Did his opinion change since then? 
I conclude on flexibility. 
In Quebec, we know perfectly well what it means. 
Flexibility means leaning always on the same side, that is toward Ottawa. 
We want nothing to do with that kind of flexibility.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):
Let us begin with the Canadian millennium scholarship fund.  
These challenges are legion. 
Let us take a closer look at this fund.  
What does that mean? 
It means that basically we have created an independent foundation based on partnership. 
The members of this foundation will come from all walks of life. 
The mandate given to them by the government is to hold consultations.  
Let us take Quebec, for example. 
My question is very simple. 
Why not to the students?  
But it is not contagious.  
No, thank God, it is not contagious. 
I will conclude, as I can see that time is quickly running out. 
The issue of national testing was raised. 
That is a totally false statement. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Madam Speaker, the secretary of state surprises me. 
The federal government does not recognize its own Constitution. 
This is the first thing we can say about such remarks.  
The second thing concerns the minister himself. 
I have great difficulty understanding the minister's position.  
The Quebec Liberals are telling you this, as are all the economic stakeholders in Quebec. 
I will conclude my remarks here. 
However, the member made an interesting point. 
We have been hearing nasty things from the opposition. 
Why then are they so upset? 
Only because they do not want to have a federal presence in Quebec. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Could I ask for the co-operation of hon. members.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We will check for quorum. 
Call in the members.  
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I will read from the Reform policy on education. 
We need to respect provincial jurisdiction in the area of education.  
In fact it is a tragic record. 
They began to give national tests in 1989. 
I notice that the Bloc motion talks about national tests. 
I would like to say a few words about that.  
I do not believe this is the case. 
I believe that the Bloc motion is misguided. 
That should be strengthened and made better, not done away with altogether.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Why can Reform not acknowledge that such funding has been increased with the present budget? 
I hope that is a smile of approval.  
Madam Speaker, it is a smile of disbelief. 
This millennium scholarship fund is something that does deserve to be talked about. 
I wish I had time.  
The other 94% will go without any assistance.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Those of us who are not fit for business will not be fit for anyone. 
Madam Speaker, it is interesting what other people sometimes hear when you talk. 
That does not mean that the private sector alone should be setting standards.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
There was no consultation with the provinces. 
There was not consultation with professionals nor with students in the post-secondary educational field. 
Let us talk a bit about the funding.  
However, I do understand this. 
The figures are well known. 
Every indication is that it will be a program based on scholarship. 
It is a privately run foundation. 
We have no idea what they will be. 
We have been listening. 
I want to ask the government why it has not been listening. 
We believe that passionately in the NDP. 
We must have a new national standard for accessibility in post-secondary education. 
We would also want to see put forward a tuition freeze. 
We will continue to see them skyrocket.  
The students of Canada and others have been demanding an adequate level of funding. 
The students of Canada need help today. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have been listening to the debate carefully. 
They are also only talking about the cash component. 
They are simply wrong in the numbers.  
Provincial priorities seem to be something other than health care or education. 
They seem to be totally out of line with the priorities of Canadians.  
Tuition is a provincial jurisdiction. 
She said directly that it was for scholarships. 
That is not true. 
Accessibility is an important priority. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
The government has no credibility to debate this point. 
It can throw mud at provincial governments and say that they are at fault. 
The issue the government has to tackle is the issue of financial need. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Madam Speaker, the resolution reads: 
Our caucus will be voting against it. 
She sort of put the problem with students in perspective. 
We will be voting against the motion for three or four reasons. 
However, in reality there is only one reason and that is students.  
That is simply not happening in Canada any more. 
There are supposedly 50,000 high tech jobs that we cannot fill. 
At the same time 1.5 million Canadians are unemployed. 
That is a very significant problem and a real shame. 
Why do we have jobs unfilled and people unemployed? 
There is a direct correclation between employment and education. 
We cannot do that with an uneducated populace.  
We are voting against the resolution. 
The problem is too grave. 
The student situation, as I say, is by far the most pertinent. 
This is not something new.  
I am from the province of Newfoundland and represent St. John's West. 
I have a couple of other reasons. 
We agree there are serious problems with the millennium fund. 
This means 1.5 million young Canadians owe $7 billion. 
It is the reason why we think the federal government should be involved. 
We are also against any unilateral action by the federal government. 
I want to make that absolutely clear to my colleagues from the province of Quebec. 
For those reasons we will be voting against the motion.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I fully agree. 
The problem of Canadian student debt and accessibility still remains. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
We are talking about a millennium fund that has gained a lot of publicity. 
Does the member not see that as a direct possibility? 
I am sure the member for Vancouver East would agree that is a direct possibility.  
Madam Speaker, I agree it is very politically motivated. 
We thought the money could be directed in a different way.  
I still think the millennium scholarship is not what it could have been. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
The motion by the Bloc member reads as follows: 
It is just after additional visibility. 
I think that the term ego trip says it all.  
Not all that long ago, I was a student myself. 
One more promise we will never see kept. 
My generation has had its fill of empty promises.  
Young people are not fools. 
The government might be well advised to listen. 
For my part, I see it as provocation. 
What happened to its commitment to create jobs and fight against poverty?  
I can hardly wait for the day.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Therefore, we are not dealing with skills, but with accessibility.  
I have a few short questions for the member. 
First, does she think that the loans and grants system is exclusively provincial? 
I already have the answer, but I want to see if she knows it.  
What did students say? 
``We are not interested in the squabbles of Pauline Marois and others''. 
What are they interested in? 
In having access to that scholarship. 
I would like to know what the member thinks about all this.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:
I guess the hon. member for Bourassa longs to become Minister of Education.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:
I hope it will not be at the federal level. 
At least not as long as the Bloc Quebecois is here.  
I do not think Mr. Dubuc is a sovereignist. 
What does the hon. member for Bourassa think about this?  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the member mentioned youth unemployment.  
When they graduate they will be earning high incomes.  
Quebec has the highest rate of high school dropouts. 
These are the kids who need help. 
She thinks education is in the provincial jurisdiction. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his question. 
I can see that he is also concerned about the unemployment issue. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
The first problem is the criteria relating to income and merit. 
We are witnessing a quest for a Canadian nation at all cost. 
The notion of two founding peoples has now been excised from federalist utterances.  
Obviously, this was not done out of any great concern for decentralization, quite the opposite.  
Recently, this consensus has fallen into oblivion. 
We are dealing with a government that does not understand the meaning of traditional demands. 
According to the morning papers, there is not such thing as traditional demands. 
Is there such a thing as education? 
We do not know yet. 
In the federal government, education no longer means education, but opportunity.  
What opportunity are we talking about here? 
This government does not have a monopoly on this centralizing vision of Canada. 
It is shared by many members of this House. 
That is why the role played by the Bloc Quebecois is so important.  
This is a very popular theme in the rest of Canada.  
The provinces have different levels of education. 
The following objectives are set out on page 31 of the document. 
I will now read a quote that particularly surprised me. 
On page 33 of the Plan, he says: 
Yes, interprovincial standards and common curricula in education. 
I will conclude by saying- 
I am sorry, but the hon. member's time is up.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, some people are worried about the next provincial election. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:
Interfering is also something very real.  
Of course Bloc members are not pleased. 
I did not hear them talk about tax breaks. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:
What does political interference mean?  
It is the same thing. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:
You are off to a bad start as minister.  
We are listening to two young members. 
I am sorry they are playing politics like the others. 
One thing is sure, people understand the subject is not jurisdiction. 
We are not getting involved at all in the field of education.  
We are talking about accessibility.  
Can you hear them. 
You have no business there.  
The first problem is young people's debt.  
We have assumed our responsibility to ensure young people's access.  
After cutting transfers to the provinces by $10 billion.  
He seems pretty worked up.  
He just said a lot of things in two minutes. 
He talked about student debt. 
Yes, student debt is a reality in Quebec. 
That means that our scholarship system works. 
The member opposite talks about accessibility. 
It does indirectly what it cannot do directly. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
He said that the federal government has increased transfers to the provinces. 
That money was invested in education. 
Mr. Speaker, just a quick answer. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Those are the two themes.  
As a matter of fact, they are involved in only one particular aspect today. 
It is about the whole issue of accessibility. 
I put these in their proper order because that is where they belong. 
The new measures announced in the budget will do these things. 
Why should we, as a federal government, be concerned about that? 
We cannot dissociate social policy from economic policy. 
It is impossible to do that sort of thing. 
It is a good saving for taxpayers.  
The $2.5 billion we start with will not be the end of it. 
There is one most important attitude which federalists and Canadians should have. 
We believe in partnership with citizens, not necessarily with governments. 
Those are institutions created to serve people.  
I am thankful for the opportunity to say why this is such an important undertaking. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I listened very carefully to the hon. member. 
As usual, members opposite have forgotten all about it, of course. 
Therefore, my question to the member is this. 
This is what the federal government is trying to show us.  
This is basically linked to economic, social and demographic considerations. 
Manpower training should meet our needs. 
I would like the member to comment on this.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
I am a Canadian first and foremost. 
I do not have a lot of time for this parochial kind of discussion.  
There is nothing wrong with being distinct.  
Many of them are related to me.  
Now Alberta is helping others. 
We help Quebec in a lot of ways and we will continue to do that. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Many reports confirm this. 
Thirty per cent did not complete high school. 
A big portion of this lag has to do with access to higher education.  
We have also changed the registered education savings plan. 
It is the federal government in partnership with parents and students. 
Who are the benefactors of all these programs? 
I do not know why this would concern the hon. members. 
I do not understand. 
That is what this is all about.  
We have come to the realization that it is for real. 
I just read the report card. 
I do not think anybody would want to have that kind of power. 
The money is being spent in provincially mandated institutions.  
In my riding I have Durham College. 
It was also mentioned in the budget. 
The president of the college slapped my back and thought that was the greatest thing. 
He did not care whether the money came from Ottawa, Toronto or anywhere else. 
He thought it was great that we had empowered students to get a good education.  
It seems odd to me.  
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
We talk a lot in this room about young offenders. 
Sometimes it is nutrition. 
The provinces are partners in this and they participate in it.  
I presume this is something that really bothers my hon. colleagues. 
I do not see how it promotes anybody in this country.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
There will be no school buses. 
This is all we want.  
The millennium fund is just one way of helping. 
I repeat that the money will be spent in provincially mandated institutions. 
The course material is provincially mandated.  
The federal government has not interfered in provincial jurisdictional. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
What is also clear is the intrusion of the federal government in this area. 
The money must be made available through the transfer payments. 
The federal government does not just print money. 
It collects this money by imposing taxes and then redistributes it.  
Quebec has no need for scholarships based on merit. 
The Prime Minister candidly replied that yes, it was.  
How can we buy them?'' 
That is what they are trying to use this fund to do.  
That is a thing of the past. 
Today, people want programs to be effective and to have a positive impact. 
That is what we want.  
We have seen Quebec students take to the streets these past few weeks. 
This is really what today's motion is all about. 
This is no longer tolerable.  
The branch offices will merely have to administer the programs.  
Quebeckers do not share this vision of Canada. 
People want provinces to be responsible for education. 
We can certainly understand that Quebec students would want to have a smaller debt.  
This is not what we want in Quebec. 
This is what we are saying on behalf of all Quebeckers.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I have listened to my hon. colleague with great interest. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Chateauguay for his comment and question. 
This is somewhat of a heritage of the Pearson years. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
I am also aware of the real problems in Quebec. 
The motion reads as follows: 
We know they are tricky.  
What have they written about it? 
I will read it to you. 
What business does the federal government have interfering? 
And they have just told us they do not want any conflict. 
When you do not want any conflict, you respect your partner.  
This centralizing attitude is not confined to education. 
Is it a question of partisan visibility? 
This visibility precludes effectiveness. 
That is the Liberals for you.  
They want millennium scholarships to be awarded on the basis of merit. 
Need is also important. 
Is the government really going to alleviate the problem of indebtedness?  
Why interfere in an area of provincial jurisdiction, such as education? 
We have just heard a motion about respect for a distinct society. 
This will be accomplished not just through words, but also through actions. 
Quebec was cut $3 billion to be put towards the millennium scholarships.  
Why are they bent on interfering in Quebec's jurisdictions? 
I think it was a wish to mark the new millennium. 
This is what students are telling us.  
Many people are against the creation of the millennium scholarships. 
The population was polled on this issue. 
They told us a while ago we were talking through our hat.  
This poll was carried out by Sondagem for Le Soleil and Le Devoir .  
But the Prime Minister always goes for half-truths. 
Some columnists are not very favourable to sovereignty. 
Lysiane Gagnon from La Presse said ``This is a glaring case of duplication''. 
The criteria are different''.  
She adds ``Provincial policies will be thwarted''.  
What did Alain Dubuc, from La Presse , have to say? 
``The cat is out of the bag''. 
The red book is entitled Preparing Canada for the 21st Century . 
This motion asks that the provincial areas of jurisdiction be respected. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
But we see these are words without any meaning.  
I would like to quote someone. 
This is a little like a riddle. 
I would like you to guess who said these words. 
I will help you at the end. 
The person I am quoting said ``Unconscious, but nonetheless specious, paternalism. 
How can the central government be so hypocritical? 
This is insulting for the provinces. 
This is harmful to the principles of representative democracy''.  
Who said the first part about federalism, paternalism and all the rest? 
So, this must be true.  
I hope this will be food for thought for the Liberals. 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, if he were here, should agree with us. 
We would be able to count on his support. 
Let us hope that his pupil, his spiritual son, will think likewise.  
Madam Speaker, I thought he was asking me to guess. 
This is bad faith. 
I would not like to associate with a partner having so little credibility. 
Ordinary people are the ones who will suffer because of this. 
What we need is a real strategy to reduce student debt loads. 
The dropout rate in Quebec is a problem. 
Universities and colleges are underfunded. 
This is an insult. 
Mr. Trudeau should be consulted about the millennium scholarships. 
Would he change his mind? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I will be sharing time with the member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
Let me enter into the substance of the debate. 
I can remember the early days of the ``quiet revolution''. 
The ``quiet revolution'' had a lot of interesting ideas. 
He asked me to sit on this. 
The British have never lived under federalism. 
There are social problems and the problem of community decision making. 
That is key to the concept of subsidiarite that the European Union is concerned with. 
Co-partnership, cogerance and co-management are the order of the day. 
All the new federal systems, the non-Anglo Saxon federal system, realize that. 
That is the real tragedy.  
Who can object to money being spent on students? 
Why cannot any government take the initiative? 
That was the real challenge.  
He gave the ruling.  
Later he announced the doctrine that the constitution is a living tree. 
It is not rooted in the concepts of 1867. 
On the immigration issue, Quebec and Ottawa have worked together. 
Rene Levesque signed the Cullen-Couture agreement with Prime Minister Trudeau. 
Quebec and Ottawa share power on immigration.  
With respect to education the question is come and join us in this new adventure. 
On that particular attitude I will end my formal comments.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I always enjoy listening to my learned colleague. 
I believe it is important to the provinces and to the House.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his thoughtful question. 
The notion that one can be bilingual and that is sufficient is dead. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I would like to ask the hon. member about his feelings relative to national testing. 
It is an issue, especially with each province investing differently in education. 
The quality of opportunities for young people are not equal.  
I would appreciate the member's feedback on that.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that thoughtful question. 
Let me personally excuse myself. 
They have invested in education. 
The member has identified a key problem. 
The municipalities are underfunded. 
I think the member identified one of the key problems in education.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
It proposes to ``censure any action by the federal government in the area of education''.  
The reason is obvious. 
The facts speak for themselves. 
This has become a fact of modern life. 
The scholarships will average $3,000 per year. 
The foundation will be a private body operating at arm's length from the government. 
It has been designed to be sensitive to provincial jurisdiction and differences. 
The need is pressing. 
This will benefit up to 100,000 graduates in financial hardship.  
The educational credit is a major form of tax assistance to students. 
So far it has been available only to full time students. 
Now part time students will have access to the credit as well. 
This will assist 400,000 students.  
The Canadian opportunities strategy meets this challenge as well. 
This can be repaid over 10 years.  
The Canadian opportunities strategy is not just concerned with today's immediate needs. 
That is very important for Canada and for the jobs it creates for Canadians.  
Having access to a computer puts the world literally at your fingertips.  
Education is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. 
The budget makes clear that we respect that profoundly. 
What we are talking about is equal access to opportunity.  
One of the issues was education. 
That is what the Canadian opportunities strategy is designed to do. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
I would like to know how a power can be shared effectively. 
Powers and jurisdictions can be shared. 
You could call that sharing jurisdictions.  
It is as if two cooks were preparing the same soup. 
The result is a very salty and unpleasant soup. 
That is the problem with jurisdictions.  
But education is ours. 
We know this field best. 
Is that really the focus of this government? 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member opposite for the question. 
We understand that, we know that and we respect that. 
That is what this government is providing.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Would there be unanimous consent to do that?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is not unanimous consent.  
I find the motion totally negative. 
There is an unfairness in the whole proposition. 
Let me put the context together for us. 
It is pretty clear that we are moving to a knowledge based economy. 
Knowledge based industries are going to be the big thing. 
Many factors are influencing that change.  
Moving and sharing information has become the new economic engine. 
This is where our young people ought to be trained.  
The costs of communication and information processing have fallen dramatically. 
Competition is going global. 
We need to recognize that distance is no longer a relevant issue. 
He said wireless digital communications.  
Where are the young people who have the skills to meet that new world?  
We do not have them here in Canada. 
This program should have moved in that direction.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
In 1848, 150 years ago, Europe was in upheaval. 
It was the year of revolution. 
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL WILLIAM BARKER 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
He was 35 years of age.  
In his day Lieutenant-Colonel Barker was a hero's hero. 
He had 50 great war air victories to his credit. 
Lieutenant-Colonel William Barker is one of Canada's forgotten heroes. 
He is also one of this country's greatest heroes. 
It is high time Canadians recognized his extraordinary achievements.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Yesterday, a group in Ontario took similar action before the courts.  
This is food for thought for the Minister of Health and his finance colleague. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Monsieur Lafontaine however was defeated in his Quebec constituency. 
The people of York North readily elected Mr. Lafontaine.  
Baldwin and Lafontaine were reformers in the true sense of the word. 
Perhaps today's Reformers could take some inspiration from their example.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to a highly respected Canadian woman. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
The Canadian government is pursuing two specific goals. 
First, it is strengthening partnerships between universities and industry. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
The hon. member for Laval East.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
All this on page 3 of a Conrad Black newspaper.  
There is no doubt about it, Canadian patriots can be proud of themselves. 
Canadian patriots are great. 
Canadian patriots love us. 
I believe Quebeckers would like to know in what high esteem they are being held.  
MEMBER FOR EDMONTON NORTH 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
She only became more determined and more enthusiastic.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
We only have this to say to our champion:
Maurice, we will let you have a rest between periods, but no more. 
Take good care of yourself and surprise us once again. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, whatever happened to the national children's agenda? 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This would enable our justice system to build a case against those- 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Whose idea was it to hide the surplus from the taxpayers? 
Was it the Prime Minister's idea or was it the finance minister's idea?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no hiding of anything. 
If anything, the auditor general is saying that we are too open.  
The Canadian people did better than previously. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's memory needs to be jogged. 
He said he found serious breaches in accounting rules. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
These people are bullies.  
This department is always playing catch-up. 
It is always playing fast and loose with people. 
My question to the minister is this, and I demand an answer. 
Why do these people write these letters at all? 
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
She has grievances against different employees and supervisors. 
It has had a long history.  
It has been withdrawn and an apology has been issued. 
The legal adviser involved is also being counselled on the matter.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Why in the world is this minister allowing his officials to personally harass this woman?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is a good example where again they have it wrong. 
There is no harassment. 
Poor judgment was exercised in this case. 
The letter has been withdrawn and an apology issued.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
There is nothing to add. 
We have made the necessary changes so that it does not happen again.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
How can she justify that?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I would like the hon. minister to please withdraw that word.  
Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the word ``lie''.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, what kind of a hoax is this? 
Who is the Prime Minister kidding? 
Let me show him firsthand the disastrous effects of these policies.  
Does he have the guts to face unemployed Nova Scotians? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This did not exist before we passed the new legislation.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
My question is simple. 
Is her answer yes or no to the recommendation?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I find that very excessive. 
It is clear that we will find a more balanced approach.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the minister's answer. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the facts are simple. 
There was an error in judgment. 
A letter was sent that should not have been sent. 
The letter has since been withdrawn and an apology has been issued.  
It is a process that this government solidly supports.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
He has done that before.  
This type of intimidation seems to be rampant in the minister's department. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
In this case there was a long history. 
There was an error in judgment that was exercised. 
QUEBEC'S TRADITIONAL DEMANDS 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Manpower training has been transferred to the provinces. 
We have given the provinces control over subsidized housing. 
We even have a resolution on spending powers.  
We do not take the whole list. 
We solve one problem at a time. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this is really not clear. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member himself has just raised the issue.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
That puts Canadian NHL teams at a tremendous disadvantage. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the interest of the hon. member. 
If he participates in the subcommittee, he will get good results.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
This is a very serious situation.  
First we lost the Quebec Nordiques. 
Then we lost the Winnipeg Jets. 
Now we are in danger of losing the Edmonton Oilers. 
Thousands of jobs are dependent upon our hockey teams. 
This is more than about economics. 
It is about our national culture.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Never have the numbers been so low. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
When it comes to the College militaire in Quebec, they get a special deal. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We are prepared to underwrite firms only when the Canadian objective is very clear. 
On the matter of the standstill, we are willing- 
The hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Does this offer include costs for all athletes coming to Canada for these games?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The information that was given is totally wrong. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
That is important and is something the subcommittee will address.  
No one is dismissing the issue. 
It will certainly be looked at and should be.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister has identified giving subsidies. 
We are talking about taking them away.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the environment minister.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Important principles are embodied in this legislation, one of them being pollution prevention. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We have removed lead from gasoline. 
We are dealing with benzene. 
We have accomplished untold numbers of things.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of immigration.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I said that I am concerned about that requirement.  
We are taking our responsibility but it is clear that the provinces- 
The hon. member for St. John's East.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
That would appear to favour immigrants from wealthy countries.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I invite the member to read all the report. 
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Parents are crying out. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The government believes it is our responsibility to help those families as well.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
Violent group crime by young Canadians appears to be growing. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
This is not what Canadians want.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Charlottetown accord was leading the country to an elected Senate. 
The Reformers campaigned very hard to make sure that the Charlottetown accord failed. 
Unfortunately they were successful.  
DECONTAMINATION OF CN LANDS 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Various governments delayed that, looking at all of the various options.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
They were advised not to do so by ports Canada officials.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very serious accusation the hon. member has made. 
If he has any evidence of that, I would like him to bring it forward.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
This is one of those good days. 
We have the Deputy Speaker and representatives of the Parliament of Slovakia.  
We also have Bonnie Mitchelson, Minister of Family Services of Manitoba.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
He is in great spirits and we expect him back soon.  
We would like to know the projected government agenda for the next several days.  
I am sure all hon. members are glad to hear the hon. member's news.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
This is the Small Business Loans Act. 
Tuesday shall be an allotted day. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
He was nonetheless recognized. 
This was certainly an oversight, and I wanted to point this out to you.  
I respect what the hon. member for Repentigny said. 
He certainly raised a good point. 
I hope this answers the question for the time being.  
Are there more questions on the Thursday question? 
The chief government whip on a point of order.  
The House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
What has happened to education? 
We need information technology. 
In other words, the courses have not changed. 
Something has to be changed.  
Universities are not getting the resources to expand their efforts in the field. 
There is a bright light. 
It is coming from private industry. 
That is what needs to happen.  
This millennium scholarship fund simply perpetuates what has always been. 
We need new thinking. 
We need innovative thinking and Nortel is showing us the way. 
This is probably one of Canada's greatest shortcomings.  
The minister of industry says this is new money. 
It is nothing of the kind. 
It is simply replacing the money that was there in 1994-95. 
What has this shortfall done? 
It has lowered the number of positions available for these researchers. 
We need to address the shortfall.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I have three children. 
They go to school. 
These are the responsibilities of individuals.  
Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted to answer that question. 
That is what I said. 
The point is that we need incentives. 
This is not an incentive program. 
Let me put this in perspective. 
It is available to perhaps 6% of the group. 
That is what I said and I hope the member listened this time.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that is a good question. 
The answer is that education is constitutionally a provincial responsibility.  
It is the same thing today. 
We need a partnerships.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Moreover this fund will do nothing to lower the present debt load of students. 
Eligibility criteria are fuzzy. 
Will the scholarships be granted on the basis of merit or need? 
We campaigned on that during the last election campaign. 
We wanted to reinvest $4 billion back into health care and education. 
We have seen that on the part of the Bloc too. 
Its amendment and the direction that it is heading with this motion is quite clear. 
It cares about education. 
I would agree with the Bloc. 
As I mentioned, education is a provincial responsibility. 
We do agree with the Bloc on that level.  
As I said, that is up for debate.  
This motion does not at all address that issue and that concerns me. 
We are open on this side to that debate. 
Maybe we can work together to create something better in this country.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Second, he shows some open-mindedness. 
The hon. member from the Reform Party describes our motion as too vague, too broad. 
I am therefore raising the matter of this contradiction.  
I would like his help in understanding it better. 
I do not think I contradicted myself at all. 
We made that clear during the course of the last campaign. 
They are most effective in dealing with those problems.  
I am not contradicting myself. 
I am actually in favour with the Bloc on that point.  
That is what is not clear. 
That is not clear in the motion. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member caught my interest.  
Unfortunately that is what some of the provinces had to do.  
The Liberal government should consider giving more trust to the provinces. 
It should start reinvesting back into them in the form of transfers. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I have been a member of this government for two years. 
The member for Saint-Eustache-Sainte-Therese, on a point of order.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
We are not interfering in education. 
Its mandate is to avoid any duplication. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
I am sorry, but when they talk about co-operation, I cannot agree. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
In the Lac-Saint-Jean area.  
Everyone said ``Things will change. 
Now, back to the issue. 
Let us talk about it. 
There are numerous economic indicators showing that things are going well and it is true. 
In 1993, there were 1 million children living in poverty in Canada. 
Now there are 1.5 million. 
I wonder what mechanisms they want to use to distribute wealth in this country.  
When we talk about the efforts of each and every Canadian, we must be cautious. 
Often, it is the provinces who make the efforts. 
But there is something else that we do not talk about often enough. 
It is the corporate sector, businesses. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
He is not a minister yet.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
That the member for Lac-Saint-Jean is talking about. 
And we will see if it takes 18 months to adapt.  
The same thing applies to the national child benefit. 
It is all written down in the budget.  
We remain true to this vision of Canada. 
I think it is an extremely comforting way of contemplating our future.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Moreover, young people with a low qualification level are more affected. 
Let us look at the combination of those figures. 
There is also a 56.4% dropout rate.  
It is a matter of how the well-being of the people is interpreted.  
Our perspective of the well-being of people is we looked at the millennium fund. 
Now they will have to look at other options in life.  
The millennium scholarships fund is very exciting and dynamic. 
It is responsive to a changing world. 
Epidemiologists say that a well educated society is a much healthier society. 
It will reduce the costs of our social services and health services. 
It will improve the quality of life within our society. 
I lived for nine years on the opposition benches. 
This will not help anybody in Quebec and is not in our best interests.  
There is much in the millennium scholarship fund. 
In her comments, the hon. member dared to lecture us, and with good reason. 
What was done about family trusts in order to help our poor children? 
Three thousand dollars a year for some students beginning in the year 2000? 
I too would be uncomfortable. 
That is not the objective of our debate. 
Secondly, we have the necessary tools to manage the money. 
It should go to the students. 
I have a question for the hon. member. 
Mr. Speaker, my sense is that this is an important undertaking. 
Members choose to ignore the tax credits and child programs. 
Every school will have a co-ordinator. 
First and foremost we have a balanced budget. 
We have been able to put in order the finances of the nation. 
They contributed to putting the financial house in order.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
He goes on to say that the federal government is duplicating existing structures. 
Quebeckers have not been fooled. 
Quebec has made major investments in its young people in the area of education. 
What is the prime minister's word worth? 
This phenomenon is not new, but it seems to be increasing. 
Thousands of young people will emigrate to urban areas. 
This misdirected program is a waste of money.  
Out of the $10 billion cut from education, $3 billion was in Quebec. 
The Quebec loans and scholarships system is very efficient. 
That is another action by the Chretien government that will be remembered.  
There will be a final evaluation in the next referendum.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Other provinces, particularly my own province of Ontario, scored very low.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Madam Speaker, I thank my kind colleague for his question.  
Let us decide what we want for our students. 
We want nothing but the best. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I also listened to the comments. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Madam Speaker, I believe the member misunderstood me.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
That is what it says. 
Let me give you my reasons for supporting it. 
We have five young members who are doing a mighty fine job. 
All day long, they led the debate. 
Ask our colleagues from New Brunswick and western Canada. 
All the provinces have had to make cuts in education and health. 
What does this Canada social transfer include? 
It has three components: social assistance, health and education. 
In education, $10 billion was cut back. 
And this is going on across Canada.  
The objective is to provide assistance to 100,000 students starting in the year 2000. 
I was listening earlier to the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
It could work in some cases.  
I know young Quebeckers have a critical mind. 
They know how to read, they are educated and intelligent. 
Why are we so protective of our education system? 
It is a question of language. 
What do we teach in our schools? 
We teach the Civil Code and different traditions. 
We may not be unique, but we are different.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member's remarks. 
It is in Montreal.  
His intentions are good, but that is not the case.  
It was another member.  
Let us forget that, it has nothing to do with it.  
He would understand that we are different. 
He would understand very quickly that we are different. 
That is an everyday occurrence.  
It is true for people in business, or other sectors. 
We must honour that.  
It is not that we do not want to get along with others. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I congratulate my colleague for his speech. 
I repeat: ``A Canadian Education Excellence Fund''.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Our government thinks otherwise. 
Our government, on the other hand, has taken a different approach. 
They confuse access to education and education itself.  
Nowhere is it mentioned that the foundation will interfere in education programs. 
Of course education is a provincial jurisdiction. 
Has that system served us badly so far? 
It goes without saying that the foundation will consult closely with the provincial governments. 
As he did last year, Mr. Landry accused us of practising predatory federalism. 
Always given to verbal exaggeration, he added another adjective, abusive. 
I wonder if we can consider him to be serious.  
All governments are called on to play a role in this field. 
It is crucial to the future of our children and our country.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I have a question for the member for Vaudreuil-Soulanges. 
The federal government had been trusting us since around 1964. 
Loans and bursaries are granted on the basis of family income. 
This is my question to the member from Vaudreuil.  
The millennium fund is aimed at giving a better future to young people. 
It gives them the opportunity to pursue post-secondary studies to better prepare their future.  
There are other examples. 
With regard to the GST, we have administrative agreements with the provinces. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The facts speak for themselves. 
The costs of post-secondary education have risen dramatically over the past 10 years. 
Student debt has become a heavy burden for many Canadians. 
First, students will get tax relief. 
In many respects, this plan resembles the home buyers plan.  
We are proposing two new measures to help those people. 
The measure will benefit up to 250,000 Canadians.  
I think this is important. 
This measure itself will benefit some 50,000 part time students with children. 
It is unfortunate that I have limited time left. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
A point of order, the hon. member for Rosemont.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
This is a debate about education. 
There will be the millennium scholarship plan. 
There are also all the other measures in the budget. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Madam Speaker, it will be difficult to comment. 
I feel as though I have listened to a budget speech.  
However, I am going to speak about all sorts of things. 
I have the impression that members speak but do not listen. 
There are some things we can talk about, but we must be specific. 
That is the first step.  
We have even been accused of not caring about the future of young people. 
We covered a lot of things. 
These are the type of questions I ask myself.  
There are other aspects which I feel were only briefly touched on. 
My hon. colleague did not even address today's motion. 
Why bother electing members? 
These are immediate comments, but I will have more to make later. 
I could go on for an hour. 
Madam Speaker, he doth protest too much. 
It is wonderful for Canadians.  
I am very glad that we are here as a government to assist those students.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I will explain why. 
We must think about the regions that need help. 
I believe it is important to maintain transfer payments. 
And the war goes on. 
I am very proud to be Canadian. 
The same thing applies to those on welfare. 
We have national programs and we should keep them. 
Student debt has increased. 
Twenty-five per cent of all bankruptcies were the result of student loans. 
As at the end of 1997 there were $37,000 bankrupt graduates. 
In my riding, I could have two full time employees just to deal with that. 
They are getting telephone calls from financial institutions that want their money. 
Young people come to my office. 
They do not have any choice, really.  
We must ask who is going to benefit from this.  
The youth unemployment rate stands at 16.5%. 
We should take a look at what is going on in education. 
Since unemployment insurance was reformed, 730,000 people were forced to go on welfare. 
Nowadays, they have to do without such a program.  
Just imagine the monster we have created.  
What would the NDP do about this? 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
But I must add that the millennium scholarships are for the year 2000. 
I have to agree with my colleague's position.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I sponsored the motion this morning. 
I will disagree slightly with what my colleague just said. 
He said that he disagreed with the NDP member.  
I think we should hear more speeches like that in the House.  
I do not believe there is nothing we can do about it. 
In my opinion, speeches like this one are taken far too lightly. 
I cannot be unmoved. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Bloc for his kind words.  
You might say he hit the nail on the head. 
They count on me to see to it that programs are maintained.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I concur with my colleague that the motion needs to be reconsidered. 
There is no national vision of education. 
The federal government has devolved its constitutional responsibilities to the provinces.  
It should not stop when they receive their high school diplomas.  
Let us look at the educational journey. 
We can look at an education in trades or in university. 
After children leave high school they need guidance. 
It was a vision of sharing the land of Canada. 
They guaranteed the educational rights of their children. 
This is a national vision.  
It is unfortunate but true. 
That is not a vision of education. 
That is industrialization and privatization of education. 
It should be given to our communities.  
There is also the French language. 
My cultural background is Metis. 
I speak Cree because that is what my parents spoke- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must, unfortunately, interrupt the hon. member at this point.  
OBSERVANCE OF TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE ON REMEMBRANCE DAY ACT 
One in ten had no answer at all.  
The results were shocking. 
It is for that reason that I have brought forward this bill.  
Many Canadians, many tens of thousands of Canadians, recognize Remembrance Day. 
They gather around the cenotaphs and memorials. 
They gather at the Legion halls in their communities across this country. 
However, many millions more do not pay that tribute. 
It is to remember the struggles in which they fought.  
I stood and watched for several minutes. 
Not a single person approached him, regarded him, commended him or spoke to him. 
Not a single person bothered to stop and take a poppy from him.  
Every business place would shut down. 
Factories would stop their equipment. 
Local and national broadcasters would cease broadcasting.  
The Royal Canadian Legion has launched a similar campaign. 
The bill is a very simple one. 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Over 60,000 men would not come home. 
Those scenes touched the hearts of all of us.  
Actually we are not alone in this. 
The British people have embraced the idea with great enthusiasm. 
So, too, have our Australian cousins. 
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
We do not oppose the bill. 
What will happen if another minute is added?  
I am including the veterans of the merchant marine. 
They took part in world conflict and were not treated fairly from the start. 
Did we have better reasons for getting involved in Vietnam?  
Let us strive instead to correct the injustices of the current system.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
We have shown leadership and have been recognized as such.  
The distribution of grants and allocation of land to these people were not fair. 
Member spoke in Cree ] 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I commend my colleague from Calgary Southeast for bringing forward this initiative.  
Veterans from across Canada were with us.  
I had two brothers who were overseas and fought in the war. 
The people in Dieppe, France never forgot the sacrifices our people made. 
We had an opportunity to visit the French cemetery in Dieppe, France. 
We all stood very stunned. 
She was Sister Valois.  
Five of our men who were there fighting during the war died in her arms. 
At our Canadian cemetery we also had a huge service. 
We had Canada pins on. 
They would say ``Please, please'' and point to the pins. 
When we gave them our lapel pins, they said ``Merci, merci'' and hugged us. 
It meant so much to them. 
It was absolutely marvellous to see.  
It should be done here for our veterans right on Parliament Hill.  
I as well as others are concerned that their legacy will fade.  
The legion reminds the children of what it really means.  
The veterans saw that the children understood and cared enough for the veterans.  
We must fuel the flame or the torch will never be passed on.  
We must continue to commemorate our veterans' legacy. 
I commend the DVA for this initiative.  
I quote from his letter to the editor dated November 15: 
There is nothing quite as expressive as silence. 
Trains, buses and cars came to a stop. 
Office workers took their phones off the hook. 
The floor of the stock exchange fell silent. 
TV networks turned off the sound.  
Is there any reason that Canada should not follow the example? 
We owe it to the yet unborn.  
I agree with the president of the Royal Canadian Legion. 
Two minutes is not a lot to ask for a lifetime of freedom.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Some of the suggestions are traditional and some are novel. 
Silence is an important component to healthy reflection. 
Many scorn those who wish to reflect on the past. 
Respect is often contagious.  
I applaud the hon. member for Calgary Southeast for this initiative. 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
It is the very least we can do.  
I urge all members of the House to vigorously lend their support. 
It will take time and effort on the part of all of us. 
These are simply words on paper until such time as they take action. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to conclude debate on the bill. 
This is a tradition which is decades old. 
It is what the Royal Canadian Legion has recommended as an appropriate period of observance. 
It is what the mother parliament, Westminister, has enacted by way of a motion. 
I am not particularly concerned about the precise wording. 
I am more concerned about the sentiment which the bill attempts to express.  
It would be for all Canadians to observe it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think that was more a point of debate. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I am interested in the real rate of return on an annual basis.  
I know the minister has in hand a pre-written, canned response. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
This is comparable to the returns of any large pension plan in the private sector.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This is totally unacceptable.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but his time is up.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The old system encouraged ongoing dependence and did not address structural unemployment. 
Labour market conditions are now substantially improving. 
As 1998 begins the unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest level in seven years. 
More than one million- 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
These teens beat this girl to death and threw her body in a gorge.  
He will not be allowed to drive for five years.  
That is quite obvious.  
He signs off by stating ``Thanks for nothing''.  
The Reform Party has drafted the necessary proposals for change in record time. 
The justice minister no longer has any excuses. 
These people have refused to move. 
The act has been in place for 14 years. 
They have done a 10 year review. 
They flew across the country to consult, consult, consult.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Criminal behaviour committed by young people needs to be denounced as wrong. 
The intervention, however, must be appropriate and effective. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but the time has expired.  
(The House adjourned at 6.49 p.m.)
