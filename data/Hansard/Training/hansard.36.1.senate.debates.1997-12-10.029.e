Wednesday, December 10, 1997 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am happy now to have them in our galleries. 
I introduce them to you, honourable senators.  
Fiftieth Anniversary of Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
His book Human Rights and the United Nations:
...those rights without which there can be no human dignity. 
They are derived from the inherent dignity of the human person.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Economic Rights as Human Rights 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
It does this both in Article 25 and in Article 22 which states: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
As you know, many other speakers wish to be heard.  
Human Rights and Ethnicity 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Let us make this our special millennium project for the protection of human rights.  
Human Rights and the Law 
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
The declaration has been cited by Canadian courts in 115 cases.  
In light of the gravity of these consequences, the presumption of innocence is crucial. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to interrupt the honourable senator, but his time is up.  
Human Rights and Parliamentary Freedoms 
However, must they become obdurate commitments hardened against or resistant to any influence or persuasion? 
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the normal time for statements is over. 
However, I make reference to rule 22(8).  
I must now ask the Senate if leave is granted.  
Hon. Phillippe Deane Gigantes :
The Hon. the Speaker :
In that case, statements are concluded.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Human Rights and Slavery 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Article 4 of the declaration states: 
Human Rights and the Status of the Citizen 
People have the right to govern or to select those who shall govern them. 
This calls for an explanation.  
The freedom and dignity of Canadian citizens has been strengthened as a result.  
Human Rights in Tibet 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that: 
Human Rights and the Family 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Honourable senators, the family has an essential role to play in our society. 
Often we take the family for granted. 
It is the family that must be focused on as a whole.  
Children are poor because their parents are poor. 
However, each of these families is a group of people united by a common affiliation.  
The Canadian family has undergone other changes over the past 30 years. 
Women have joined the workforce in unprecedented numbers. 
The result is that the modern family is faced with many new challenges. 
The two parents have to divide their responsibilities between the workplace and the home. 
They have to find reliable and affordable child care services. 
Families are closely linked to the economy and to the community. 
Governments have to be responsive to these changes. 
There are three paragraphs to Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
I should like to draw your attention to the second one: 
This has been a problem.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Human Rights and the Right to Privacy 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators, Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: 
We must be protected against the unauthorized collection or use of such information.  
Human Rights and Property Rights 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: 
Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others.  
2. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.  
These are my reflections on property rights, honourable senators.  
Section 1( a ) of the Bill of Rights states: 
Human Rights and the Legal Personality 
Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.  
He is a subject of law anywhere in the world.  
They also have a legal personality.  
Article 1 of the Quebec Civil Code provides: 
Every human being possesses a legal personality and has the full enjoyment of civil rights.  
There is little United Nations' jurisprudence on the question. 
These principles are being systematically violated in Canada today. 
This is primarily because of funding problems. 
Costs are even higher for Masters and Ph.D. students. 
Human Rights and Health and Well-Being 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
Article 25 provides for rights related to health and well-being. 
Industrial countries have health problems, too. 
Nearly 2 million people are affected by HIV. 
Malnutrition is on the rise. 
There is, however, another dimension to this picture. 
To paraphrase Arnold Toymbee: 
Human Rights and the Right to Religious Freedom 
On this day, honourable senators, let us follow Professor Humphrey's example. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.  
There are, however, those countries in which this right is not recognized. 
Notice of Motion to Permit Committees to Meet During Adjournments 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, December 11, 1997, I will move: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, December 11, 1997, I will move: 
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Eighth Report of Committee Presented 
Wednesday, December 10, 1997 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs (Legislation): 
Professional and Special Services 
Special Committee on Post-Secondary Education: 
Professional and Special Services 
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Canadian Human Rights Act 
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday, December 11, 1997, I will move: 
Human Rights in Asia 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is a very useful suggestion made by Senator Kinsella. 
I think it is a very commendable and worthwhile suggestion.  
United Nations Committees-Possible Change in Government Policies-Government Position 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It is one of CIDA's six priority areas for programming. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
We took the lead in encouraging other countries to come forward. 
Honourable senators, there has been absolutely no change. 
Honourable senators, we took a particularly aggressive role in this area. 
We can learn and gain from the scrutiny of other countries. 
In turn, we have asked other countries to do the same. 
This appears to be a fundamental shift in Canadian policy.  
Is this not a change of policy which has been directed by cabinet?  
It would surprise me to learn that we have not agreed to cooperate.  
However, I will endeavour to obtain a proper answer to my honourable friend's question.  
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
Do common justice and common decency not prevail in this case?  
Has Senator Thompson produced a medical certificate indicating that he has an illness? 
If so, which ones?  
Is his office not receiving telephone calls?  
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for his questions. 
I will try to answer them in order as best as I can.  
The honourable senator asks whether all due diligence was taken. 
As far as I am concerned, the answer to the question is "yes."  
The honourable senator asks if Senator Thompson was notified. 
His office was notified before the report was tabled in the Senate.  
He has the opportunity to do that. 
I think that is fair. 
That opportunity was given to him.  
Those actions fairly accurately reflect the actions that were taken yesterday.  
The short answer is that Senator Thompson was notified.  
Does Senator Thompson have a medical certificate? 
I understand that he has tabled medical certificates with the Senate. 
I point out that our report made no mention of medical certificates. 
He is not here to carry out his duties. 
The indication we have is that he will not return to carry out his duties. 
Did Senator Thompson break any Senate rules? 
We are all here in attendance in accordance with that proclamation. 
I believe that is a sound basis on which to make a decision.  
There is no evidence that he intends to come. 
Does it make medical certificates null and void? 
Are there separate rules for individual senators? 
Did we state that the RCMP or Revenue Canada should be called in? 
I hope that will be clearly reported. 
That clearly is not the case.  
If so, when and how? 
Is his office not receiving mail or telephone calls?  
The honourable senator mentioned that Senator Thompson has broken the rules. 
Nor did the honourable senator answer the first question. 
Was it at the same time?  
It was not at the same time. 
I hope that that has answered the honourable senator's question.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I certainly will ask the appropriate authorities if that is possible.  
Linkage of Issues to Provision of Aid-Government Position 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
And for limousines to drive their ministers.  
That is your view, Senator Haidasz, and I have my view. 
Like the Three Gorges Dam, you will flood them out.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate explain this censorship?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Jennifer Lang, an official of the Prime Minister's press office stated that: 
They directed me to take this out, take that out. 
They're lying and I don't appreciate that.  
I will certainly endeavour to get that information, if it is available.  
Answers to Order Paper Questions Tabled 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Income Tax Conventions Implementation Bill, 1997 
The letter is dated December 9, 1997.  
The final paragraph reads: 
The Honourable Paul Martin.  
Honourable senators, I should like to table the letter with the clerk.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the tabling of the letter?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Will that letter be included in the Journals of the Senate if it is tabled? 
It should form part of the record.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does the Senate wish to order that it be included in the Journals?  
( For text of letter, see today's Journals of the Senate.)  
Hon. Nicholas William Taylor :
However, I will undertake to inform Senator Kirby of my honourable friend's request. 
I believe, in due course, it will in any event.  
Bill read third time and passed.  
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
Secretary to the Governor General 
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Honourable senators, I yield the floor to Senator St. Germain.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Combined with that is the Guaranteed Income Supplement paid to our poorest seniors. 
Their conclusion was based on the following reasons: 
Employment will decline in either case.  
What is this government trying to do? 
Does the government want the rate to go even higher? 
I recognize that, recently, premiums were reduced by a few cents. 
I am talking here of our young people who are graduating from our educational institutions. 
Honourable senators, the changes before us will hurt working Canadians. 
I look forward to continued discussions in committee. 
I believe these types of appointment are wrong. 
We must rise above such dealings. 
Do you wonder how this pure patronage has taken place? 
I am sorry to say that I most likely fit into one of those categories.  
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Honourable senators, I rise to take part in the debate on Bill C-2. 
The bill sets out the powers and responsibilities of this board.  
That will include many of us, I dare say.  
Suffice it to say that these changes will hurt virtually every Canadian. 
The Liberals had something to do with that too. 
Once in a while lightening strikes, Senator Taylor, and they see the light. 
That is the theory. 
Let us look at the reality.  
The board should be subject to the Access to Information Act. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave to extend?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am very grateful to this end of the Senate. 
Parliament will not approve the selection of the board of directors. 
The only thing that Parliament will get is the annual statement.  
Will this board perhaps be accountable to the provinces? 
There is a requirement that the minister consult first on appointments - not listen, but consult. 
Can you imagine the conversation? 
What do you think?" 
The provinces say, "Please don't." 
No, honourable senators, it will not. 
He or she picks the board. 
He or she alone fires the board. 
Some will follow a proper balance between non-interference and proper management. 
Some ministers will use it as a toy for economic re-engineering. 
Fortunately, there is a simple solution. 
Mr. Ambachtshere says this: 
I know you have experience in mismanagement, but - 
I do not think it takes into consideration the best interests. 
I think it could be changed for the better. 
CANDU reactors to China.  
How many of your friends invested in Bre-X and lost all their money? 
The assumption is that you guys know better, and you do not. 
You have fallen on your face many times.  
Tell us about Dome Petroleum.  
I do not think that question deserves an answer.  
Honourable senators, I would like to adjourn the debate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Debate has been adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I had not yet asked if it is agreed.  
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Now there is a notice of motion before the house.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The pertinent part of this rule states: 
We were cut off yesterday by a motion to adjourn the debate by Senator Gigantes. 
We were up on our feet immediately today when the item was called. 
We brought forward two speakers, one after the other. 
I find this totally unacceptable. 
It is contrary to what the rule states.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, there have been some discussions with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. 
There has been no agreement. 
In that, he is quite right. 
He was not informed of Royal Assent today. 
I even phoned his leader in an attempt to contact him. 
Unfortunately, I failed to make contact with him. 
However, I did attempt to convey that information to him.  
Might I ask a question of the honourable senator? 
This is only the third day that this bill has been before the Senate. 
The government moved second reading on Monday. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I believe this whole discussion is out of order. 
This is a motion to limit debate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have no knowledge of the background leading up to this notice of motion. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
As Senator Kinsella pointed out, the rule is very specific. 
The rule could not be clearer.  
There is also an absolute contradiction in the deputy leader's approach. 
It is an interpretation. 
One cannot use motivation to support a procedural point. 
One can certainly quote a rule which is very specific. 
The conditions in this rule have not been met. 
Therefore, the notice of motion is out of order.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
The House of Commons withdrew.  
The Right Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to retire.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of Opposition) :
That is to say, no notice of motion can be given on that basis.  
The rule is specific. 
It is not general. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The notice of motion was given today.  
This is simply a notice of motion.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, we are making a parody of the rules. 
The deputy leader is putting the cart before the horse. 
Once it is imposed, you cannot seek agreement.  
She is condemned out of her own mouth.  
The Deputy Leader of the Government has contradicted herself at least twice. 
He again made that suggestion on October 23. 
We cannot be accused of delaying the passage of this bill. 
That is an opinion which does not relate directly to the point of order.  
Even the deputy leader, perhaps unwittingly, has admitted that herself.  
No such admission has been made. 
At that point, I told him that I would be introducing a notice of motion.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The plain language in the section is clear and has at no time been contradicted. 
Hon. Richard J. Stanbury :
Rule 39(1) says: 
That is not speculation, that is a fact.  
...that the representatives of the parties have failed to agree to allocate...  
That again is a matter of fact. 
They do not have to have a discussion.  
On the basis of the plain wording, it could be without discussion. 
That they have failed to agree. 
That is all it says.  
That is why it was adjourned. 
If so, at that time, notice of motion to allocate may be given. 
It is very clear on the plain language of the rule. 
It is a matter of fact. 
However, she has had a discussion about it. 
They were talking about the time of day.  
That is a matter between the two of them.  
Senator Stanbury neglected to deal with the operative words of the rule. 
That one phrase in the entire rule is the operative phrase.  
I would disagree completely.  
Those are not the operative words at all. 
They have failed to agree. 
The essence of the application is to allocate time. 
There is a request that this chamber allocate and fix the time.  
They failed to agree to allocate.  
The essence of the application is allocation.  
It is your responsibility to protect us.  
I request that you favour the position of Senator Oliver and not Senator Stanbury. 
I am asking you to rule wisely, Your Honour.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
It would make life easier for the Speaker. 
I am quite aware of that.  
It is impossible for me to rule on that matter. 
I must accept that the notice of motion is in order.  
The ruling should be appealed.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, we are appealing the ruling.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the question before the Senate is:
Will the Speaker's ruling be sustained?  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the ruling?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "yeas" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Please call in the senators.  
Speaker's ruling sustained on the following division: 
( Saint-Louis-de-Kent ) 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, honourable senator, but your question is out of order.  
I ruled quite clearly that the notice of motion was in order. 
On motion of Senator Spivak, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Motions in Amendment-Votes Deferred 
The Hon. the Speaker :
According to Beauchesne's 6th Edition, citation 580 at pages 176-177, a sub-amendment: 
Debate can now resume.  
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Honourable senators, I move adjournment of the debate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is before the Senate.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of adjourning the debate, please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to adjourning the debate please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion the "nays" have it. 
Therefore debate shall continue.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion negatived on the following division.  
( Saint-Louis-de-Kent ) 
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
Courtesy does have its limits and I believe we have reached that limit today.  
There have been several points of order and several adjournments.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
What question are we speaking on?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The question before the Senate is the sub-amendment moved by the Honourable Senator Phillips.  
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
I am entitled to speak on the sub-amendment and on the amendment.  
Let us review the progress we have made. 
The Speaker ruled that no breach of order existed. 
On November 25, the order was called and was stood. 
That means no one spoke to it. 
On November 26, the order was called and it again was stood. 
On November 27, debate finally resumed, one week after it began. 
Up to that point, there had been only one speech - mine. 
No one spoke to the order. 
Senator Lynch-Staunton moved the adjournment. 
On December 3, the order was stood.  
On December 4, Senator Kinsella adjourned the debate.  
On Monday of this week, December 8, Senator Phillips adjourned the debate. 
Honourable senators, I would suggest, have had plenty of time to prepare their remarks.  
The amendment and the sub-amendment do not change the basic debate, honourable senators. 
The motion for second reading is self-explanatory. 
The amendment and sub-amendment effectively negate the original motion. 
There may be merit in it. 
I should like to talk about the consequences of not passing Bill C-16. 
The whole neighbourhood was, to say the least, disrupted. 
Evidence can disappear and violence can erupt in these situations.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We cannot hear Senator Moore.  
We should adjourn the debate, then!  
The solutions to the Feeney situation vary from region to region. 
In some areas, it is arguable that the preferred solution could be unconstitutional. 
The very fact that solutions vary is very problematic. 
The Supreme Court has not ordered Parliament to do something. 
A perusal of the decision of Mr. Justice Sopinka confirms that. 
The Supreme Court has opened the door for Parliament to speak on this issue. 
It is an opportunity that Parliament may choose to seize. 
This is one of the reasons why we are here.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I have a question.  
I move second reading, Your Honour.  
You cannot do that, Your Honour, because it is now six o'clock.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
No, not quite six o'clock.  
It is two minutes before the hour!  
Let the honourable senator ask a question.  
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Honourable Senator Moore. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
No, to send it to the committee.  
Honourable senators, I wish to speak but the clock reads six o'clock.  
You have spoken already!  
The clock reads six o'clock.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
You can begin your speech, honourable senator. 
There is about a half a minute left. 
At the moment, you have one minute. 
Therefore, you may begin.  
I will use the 15 seconds available to me.  
I have begun to think - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am sorry, but I must interrupt the honourable senator. 
The clock now reads six o'clock. 
Is there a desire for me not to see the clock? 
Am I to see the clock?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The sitting of the Senate was suspended.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Mr. Trudeau was reflective, insightful, and forthright. 
I would ask that the committee deal with this matter expeditiously. 
AND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE that the said motion shall be made on the following grounds: 
and such further and other grounds as this Court may permit.  
DATED at Ottawa, this 7th day of November, 1997.  
Counsel for the Intervener, 
The Attorney General of Canada 
Mr. Roy's affidavit reads at paragraph 11: 
At paragraph 24, Mr. Roy spoke of Minister Don Boudria: 
Mr. Roy's affidavit continued at paragraph 25: 
This is a grievous and solemn matter. 
Bill C-16 was submitted to the Supreme Court for judgment. 
Mr. Roy continued at paragraph 29, describing parliamentary proceedings, saying: 
At paragraph 32, Mr. Roy spoke to the Senate's proceedings by saying: 
The Senate will now have to give consideration to Bill C-16. 
The extension he sought was exclusively for this body. 
The Senate is not a supplicant to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
The contempt is profound. 
Mighty and lucrative are the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats who drive them. 
Their interests are numerous and varied. 
I am a Liberal. 
This is a dictate, a command, from the Supreme Court of Canada.  
I speak now to the Royal Prerogative. 
Their limits are the limits of responsible government. 
"Judicial authorization" is a meaningless term. 
This is judicial legislative-making, judicial activism.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to inform the honourable senator that the 15-minute time period has elapsed. 
Are you seeking leaving to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Thank you, honourable senators.  
Judicial legislative-making is anti-democratic and subversive of Parliament. 
Judges must stand aside and let current democratic parliamentary majorities rule. 
It is naked political judicial activism. 
I reject the Supreme Court of Canada's legislative activities. 
I thank honourable senators for their attention.  
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
I should like to ask Senator Cools a question. 
Would she mind tabling the affidavit from which she quoted? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to table the document?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I would be delighted to table the document from which I was quoting. 
The top page is the judgment itself. 
It is a document of some 35 to 40 paragraphs. 
I would be quite happy to table the document.  
I encourage all senators to read it and to study it carefully. 
If they have any doubts whatsoever, it is here.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, Honourable Senator Cools, you have had your speech. 
It is simply a question of tabling the document, if you please.  
I was in the process of tabling it. 
Usually tabling takes a word or two.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
No, I am sorry, Honourable Senator Cools, it does not.  
How can it be tabled if it is not identified by name?  
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
I find this objectionable. 
Feeney, when arrested, was wearing clothing still heavily splashed in blood. 
We must be mindful of the condition of, and the frailty of, our very elderly. 
In recent weeks, there have been many articles in the media regarding the judiciary. 
I would like to mention just a few.  
With Legal Aid, that wallet may be bottomless.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
This is not a partisan political issue. 
There is a clash, honourable senators. 
In this instance, it is before this chamber. 
This goes further, honourable senators. 
In other words, that is a threat, a blackmail in other jargon of similar kind.  
The problem is that there is a time line involved. 
We are in a bit of a box. 
We are in a bit of a conundrum. 
At least we will have a few days in which to consider this.  
Senator Cools has done us a service by raising this matter. 
This is a subject to which I have never attended previously. 
A number of other honourable senators are beginning to give serious consideration to this matter.  
Also, we have the sub-amendment to which I am speaking.  
I support the sub-amendment that Senator Phillips has moved. 
This debate is not occurring just in political science graduate classes. 
Many Canadians are discussing this issue because they are beginning to understand the impact.  
We recognize that our role is to legislate. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The documents are 10 pages in length and some of them contain much material. 
It is simply an impossibility.  
I trust this will be acceptable.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, we will try to obtain the translation as quickly as we can.  
The question immediately before us is on the sub-amendment.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the sub-amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those in favour of the sub-amendment please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the sub-amendment please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is there an agreement as to the length of the ringing of the bell?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Thank you, Senator Lynch-Staunton.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec." 
2. This Amendment may be cited as the "Constitution Amendment, year of proclamation (Quebec)" 
What does this mean in plain English? 
This is a more fundamental issue. 
It seems to me that this is a much more fundamental issue.  
The assembly is made up of 33 Quebec bishops, representing 25 dioceses throughout the province. 
What does this letter say? 
I shall read it to you: 
The Catholic church is a hierarchical organization. 
However, the bishops raise another point in their letter. 
...maintaining the denominational guarantees provided by Bill 107.  
What does Bill 107 say? 
So, what are the bishops asking for? 
Again, let us look at Bishop Morissette's letter: 
What about the representatives of the Anglican faith? 
The rule of fairness must prevail.  
What does all this mean? 
They are content with the general guarantees applying to all faiths.  
Honourable John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I have a question for Senator Joyal. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to continue, honourable senators?  
There is no doubt in my mind about that. 
There is no doubt about this, in my opinion.  
I totally agree with you. 
This is an essential part of the decision we must make. 
That is the basic question we must ask ourselves.  
The debate comes down to this fundamental issue.  
They do not actually have this right now. 
In his letter, Bishop Morissette asks: 
- that the denominational guarantees afforded by Bill 107 be maintained.  
They do not have these guarantees. 
By approving the resolution, we are discouraging the renewal of the notwithstanding clause.  
However, I refer you again to Monsignor Morissette's letter, in which he states: 
The bishops leave it up to the political authorities. 
The bishops are prepared to accept this situation. 
They tell us this is their fundamental position.  
Under the circumstances, I can only accept their decision. 
As we say, "Rome has spoken." 
May I make one last comment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it a question, Senator Lynch-Staunton?  
We are allowed to make comments and to ask questions?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That guarantee is not there.  
The Anglican bishop, in less direct terms, came to the same conclusion. 
Those guarantees are not there.  
Hon. Jean B. Forest :
Honourable senators, I wish to address a question to the Honourable Senator Joyal. 
I respect the weight of evidence my honourable friend places on the bishops' letters. 
However, I would make a different interpretation.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Does Senator Taylor have a question? 
If not, I was about to move the adjournment.  
Hon. Nicholas William Taylor :
Might I also ask Honourable Senator Joyal a question?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I must ask again leave of the Senate. 
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Why do you think this system will be better than the other? 
Quebec society has become more diverse since the Constitution Act of 1867 was adopted. 
It was not to prevent people from worshipping in the religion of their choice. 
That is the only reason.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Wood, debate adjourned.  
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of this report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I assume that that agreement still carries.  
We started with the Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs, the Honourable Stephane Dion. 
Honourable senators, these were people with significant things to say. 
They were heard out and listened to by the committee members. 
Was there unanimity among the witnesses? 
Not surprisingly, there was not. 
The proposed system would also be unique in Canada. 
There is no other option in Newfoundland. 
It is also one of the poorest provinces in Canada. 
We were told that school enrolment has declined severely. 
That amendment was a compromise solution. 
All schools would have remained denominational schools and there were provisions for unidenominational schools. 
Clearly, that compromise did not work. 
Accordingly, he granted a preliminary injunction. 
Honourable senators, would the honourable senator would accept a question?  
This time, the question was very simple and straightforward: 
Let's be very clear about what that means. 
We're proposing a single school system with provision for religious education for our students.  
People knew what they were voting for.  
All members but one were present for the vote. 
Doctor Bonaventure Fagan and of the Roman Catholic Education Committee told us: 
She said that subsection (2): 
It is a constitutional obligation placed on the legislature. 
The people of the province can rely on it, it was guaranteed to them.  
With respect to subsection (3) she said: 
There is no requirement, such as where numbers warrant. 
A single parent could exercise the right, a single parent of any denomination. 
Their children do not have to participate. 
These are the two fundamental propositions that flow from paragraph (3) of Term 17.  
The option is there for students to opt out.  
For some, this point will never be resolved. 
In fact, 73 per cent of voters in the province supported this amendment. 
They remain distinctive, and I am one of them. 
They too voted in that referendum from their own special perspectives.  
It is a mythical political day when any proposal produces unanimity among the electorate. 
He voted in favour of the amendment, saying: 
I believe that now we have to move on. 
I will support this resolution.  
As Mr. Dion said on Monday, in speaking in the other place on the resolution: 
Changes affecting a minority deserve even greater prudence.  
He went on to suggest the principles that could be applied, saying: 
If you're Jewish, you don't. 
It's as simple as that.  
We also heard concerns from a representative of the Labrador Metis Association. 
As one Roman Catholic teacher and parent expressed it: 
The religion comes into the school with the children.  
He strongly supported this proposed amendment.  
Let me single out two stories which underline some of the very practical, everyday concerns.  
This scenario, we were told, is repeated across the province.  
There is, and has been, little money available. 
Schools are often bare, poorly equipped and poorly landscaped. 
Libraries, even in better schools, have few books. 
In some a book cart will suffice. 
I think you understand the problem. 
We don't have the protection contained in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  
She said some do not know the complete parts of a sentence. 
Another integrated school student summed up her views as follows: 
I think it would be a good thing. 
It seems so petty to me. 
What kind of message is this giving to elementary kids? 
One witness told us: 
I have to say there is stress on our children. 
And they didn't know last year. 
Honourable senators, I have gone on, I know, a very long time. 
We have been here in this chamber a very long time today. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to interrupt the honourable senator, you her 45-minute speaking period is over.  
I am winding up. 
May I have leave to complete my remarks?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Honourable senators, we also will be engaged in a free vote on this issue. 
Each of us has an equal choice when the resolution is before us. 
I would encourage colleagues to support their decision.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Would the Honourable Senator Fairbairn entertain a question or two?  
Honourable senators, that is a question, of course, that I cannot answer. 
Honourable senators, I cannot decide what is right for Newfoundlanders. 
Our committee heard from many voices. 
We read many briefs and received much information. 
I respect that, honourable senators. 
They see that as a sufficient commitment to justify the change.  
Yes, there are strong minorities. 
Among the protected churches, there are a whole set of other minorities. 
Obviously, each one of us will do that.  
I heard her speak of the other minorities. 
I repeat that it was enshrined in the Constitution of this country. 
How does my honourable friend know that?  
I believe Senators Kinsella, Murray, Pearson and Gigantes would agree.  
Circumstances change people's minds. 
Hon. William J. Petten :
I continue to say that I am a new Canadian, and I am. 
It was very important vote to me at the time. 
I voted in favour for the current school system to continue. 
That is why I will be voting in favour of the resolution.  
Might I ask the Honourable Senator Petten a question, honourable senators?  
That is the point I am making.  
What is the point of constitutional amending formulas, then?  
With due respect, I disagree.  
On motion of Senator LeBreton, for Senator Doody, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
