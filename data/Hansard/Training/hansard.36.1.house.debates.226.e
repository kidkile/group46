The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions from various areas. 
The first petition is from the Toronto-Mississauga area. 
The second petition is primarily from Lethbridge, Alberta. 
The third petition is from Scarborough and other areas, including Calgary. 
The petitioners pray that parliament adopt this law.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 215 will be answered today. 
Question No. 215- Mr. John Duncan:

Last week the bill was in committee. 
We had witnesses on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 
By Thursday morning, the bill was in committee for clause by clause. 
It deals with $100 billion. 
It is the livelihood of the retirees of the civil service. 
Last Thursday morning, the bill was in committee for clause by clause. 
I have the transcript from the committee meeting. 
On page 13 of the transcript I said: 
There is no limit on my time, Mr. Chairman, I'm not aware. 
Can you tell me where I'm limited on my time?  
It was an absolute impossibility.  
I will now refer to some comments by the member for Humber-St. 
Barbe-Baie Verte in Newfoundland. 
As he was interrupting my speech, he said: 
It was an affront to the democratic process in the House. 
I will mention another comment that I made in committee. 
He has perhaps the best expertise and is the most qualified person in the country.  
Unfortunately there was no opportunity. 
I think one word was changed. 
The word ``and'' was deleted and the word ``or'' was inserted, or vice versa.  
They were not interested in talking about substantive change. 
They were not even talking about analysing for minute change. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
The government is picking on people who already are not well off. 
Obviously, the funds have accumulated some surpluses. 
First, they began by cutting transfer payments to the provinces. 
The government had some responsibilities toward them. 
It then congratulated itself ``See how well we are running things''.  
They are the ones who bore the brunt of paying down the deficit. 
Pay equity is also involved. 
These are the women who paid off the deficit. 
They are paying off the debt.  
We are talking about $14.9 billion for the public service. 
A lot of these people work in my riding. 
It recalls for me unfortunate examples from the past.  
He was one of the first to take money from pensions of his own workers.  
I see the President of the Treasury Board travelling about on his own Titanic . 
We will let you have a few debates in the House. 
If you are not happy, we will use closure''.  
One also wonders about the signal that is being sent to private businesses. 
A bill like this one will send signals if it is passed. 
The answer we get is ``No, there is no problem. 
No, we have no commitment in that. 
We were not the watchdog, settle your own problems''. 
This however was not the government's intention. 
It could see the surplus that was accumulating.  
We can see all the intentions of this government. 
This is a terrible example for private employers to follow now. 
The dictatorship of the majority must stop. 
It is time to stop treating employees with disdain. 
The government must assume its responsibility. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I cannot use the word theft. 
Is the word excrement allowed in the House of Commons? 
That is one word which certainly comes to mind. 
I do not believe it is in the book. 
I wish them well when they go back to their ridings.  
Opposition to this bill is building up steam as we speak. 
Right across the country seniors are rallying. 
That is exactly what is happening with this bill. 
Like every good son, I had brunch with my mother on Sunday. 
She collects a pension through the public service pension plan. 
It was a very nice brunch. 
Her question was ``Is that not part of our pension?'' 
That is an innocent question which came right out of the blue. 
An 82 year old woman saw immediately what was happening. 
You get your benefits, but the surplus is not yours''.  
It is part of the pay package. 
That is where we got off to a bad start.  
First of all, he is wrong. 
It is not the union that is trying to claim the money. 
None of that money would go to the union. 
The union is arguing that it should go to the beneficiaries. 
The government had made up its mind in a cold and callous way. 
This is a pattern we have seen before. 
This is not a Cadillac pension. 
Nobody is living in luxury as a result of it.  
The legislation is really silent on that. 
The only goal would be to produce the maximum profit. 
That would be fundamentally wrong. 
I think the beneficiaries would want to speak out against that. 
They will not get a chance to speak out against it now. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. members for participating in the debate. 
In my own personal view it has some merit.  
Basically, those who contribute to the pension plan are all public servants. 
That is the way the policyholders themselves would like the pension plan to be administered. 
I ask hon. members opposite to bear that in mind.  
A point has to be made. 
There were very few amendments put forward by the opposition. 
Very few amendments were put forward by the opposition to this particular legislation. 
Therefore, that in itself was a limitation on debate. 
That is a point in which I think members of the House would be interested. 
Now we have a chance to renew the debate. 
We have to maintain a focus on very specific issues. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I think it was a red book promise. 
Again that was cynical. 
The level of morale in the public service is at an all-time low. 
I see some hon. members present who serve on the finance committee with me. 
We are studying the issue of productivity. 
Committees are being operated as branch plants of the ministers' offices. 
Government members are told to pass bills but not really discuss them. 
Why is it doing that? 
Because it wants to get its hands on that $30 billion surplus.  
The government would tell Canadians that that money is being applied to the debt. 
This treatment of parliament and of public servants has to end.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
It is a tragic abuse of this House. 
We are only on Group No. 1 amendments at the moment. 
The House was aware of any changes that were made. 
There was public scrutiny. 
That served the public interest and the employees covered by this plan.  
What does this legislation propose to do in that arena? 
They are appointed to the positions.  
After this legislation, guess what? 
Backbench Liberals will support that.  
It may make decisions without full consideration of the long term implications of those decisions. 
We are trying to bring some quality control back into the process.  
At present there is no obligation to inform us. 
Let us look at some of the other Reform amendments. 
Who would this protect? 
It would protect the employees who are contributing to the pension plan. 
Without this protection rates can go up or down. 
Without that there is no protection.  
Let us look at Motion No. 32. 
With great chagrin I have to stop. 
I hope my colleagues in the House have heard my appeal. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
Nor does the interest of the public seem necessarily to be served.  
Such action is precedent setting. 
What the federal government is doing with Bill C-78 is unfair. 
It is setting a poor example for companies and decision makers.  
There are several indications that it is acting in bad faith. 
I am not in the least surprised. 
What did the federal government do for unemployed workers? 
Exactly the same thing. 
This is of course unfair. 
It is also a misappropriation of funds. 
It is the workers and employers who contribute to that plan. 
This is unfair, and even immoral and dishonest. 
The government collects a lot of taxes and has a lot of debts. 
Taxes have increased considerably since it took office. 
Since 1993, there have been about 38 increases. 
As has been said, this is dishonest. 
It is a kind of piracy. 
There are plenty of examples. 
The President of Treasury Board does not seem to be contemplating this possibility. 
Once again, this is a roundabout way of taxing people. 
Unfortunately, this is a most unfair way as well.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I read something very interesting yesterday in the National Post . 
Government wants to know what creates unhappy workers. 
The government is to spend $1 million to do that. 
First there is the pay equity concern. 
It totally ignored pay equity. 
It broke its promise on pay equity. 
There is an absolute disregard for their future in terms of their pensions. 
It will take this money and spend it willy-nilly.  
The RCMP does a fantastic job. 
It is a disgrace what the federal government is doing. 
The government has done it in many other aspects. 
It never took the government four hours to write up this legislation.  
If he says they are right then they are absolutely bang on. 
Why is it hiding it? 
Why is it ramming the bill through so fast?  
It will not even allow elected parliamentarians to speak to it.  
It will not do that because it is afraid to face the public.  
Does it need a new road? 
Does Halifax need a new building? 
Do they need this or that? 
Do they need tax cuts? 
Liberals keep saying that it is Canadian taxpayers money. 
It was not new money. 
It could be a tax reduction budget. 
That is where the money will come from. 
It is nothing new.  
There is nothing new about it. 
I would be ashamed to be a Liberal backbencher. 
They are like sheep or grazing cattle. 
They sit back and do whatever cabinet tells them.  
We know what we would tell them. 
It should improve pension benefits. 
That is what the money was there for. 
I could talk all day on this subject. 
Canadian electors are too smart for that. 
They will see through this smoke and mirrors in a heartbeat. 
They will know right away. 
I echo the words of my colleague for Winnipeg Centre. 
It is not union money. 
That is where the money belongs, not to the treasury board minister. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That is being seriously eroded by the present government. 
I wish there were someone over there with some principles. 
This is not the will of the people. 
This is not the wish of the people. 
This is a dictatorship. 
This is one way respect could be restored. 
We are dealing with public service pensions. 
I feel very strongly about it as well. 
It is unconscionable that the bill should be rammed through. 
For many years I taught at a technical institute. 
It just happens there are many amendments. 
What is the role of parliamentarians? 
It is to listen to each other. 
Therefore we have put forward a number of amendments. 
This will probably be my last opportunity to speak on the subject. 
I do not think that ought to be so.  
There are several groups of amendments. 
When it comes to pensions it is important to consider some basic thoughts. 
There is an MP pension plan. 
It was the same thing with the Canada pension plan. 
Now there is this pension plan. 
The question very simply is who should pay for it? 
We need to make sure the mathematics is done correctly. 
Whose money is it? 
It has to do with taking things that do not belong to you.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I find it interesting. 
That is not true.  
Is that not bizarre in a democracy? 
When we get a majority it means we are responsible to do things. 
It means we are the government.  
I do not think they would. 
How did that surplus build up? 
A surplus of some $30 billion has been identified. 
This is only one program of many.  
The math is quite mind boggling. 
I am really curious. 
I do not understand it. 
It goes contrary to everything they have stood for. 
Where is the public?  
We do not hear about the bill. 
There are things we could not agree with.  
That is exactly what has happened here. 
That process has taken place. 
Nobody is ramming anything through. 
That is the other point. 
The bill went to the natural resources committee. 
A member stood and showed this 200 page bill. 
They are minor amendments.  
We are talking about reducing the national debt.  
On the backs of the workers.  
It is not your money.  
The money belongs to the taxpayers of Canada. 
That is the position the opposition takes. 
The employer''-taxpayer-``shoulders the risk and should get any reward''.  
That is a statement right out of the Vancouver Sun . 
The Edmonton Journal said ``The reason is simple: that is government money. 
We know whose it is. 
It is the taxpayers' surplus.  
This bill is responsible. 
It is now in the House at report stage. 
In this case, democracy is working well.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
One would not give the job of managing blood to Dracula. 
This is the worst mistake the Parliament of Canada could make.  
The management board could properly manage the accumulated surpluses. 
It could establish contributions. 
It does not take a rocket scientist to figure this out.  
In the event of deficits, premiums would be increased. 
This is always part of negotiations.  
He has never needed to negotiate his salary and working conditions. 
As a general rule, contributions to the pension fund are on a fifty-fifty basis. 
The good member opposite should know that.  
So the fund shrinks by only $100 million a year. 
We find two things particularly maddening. 
This is $30,000 million. 
It is a huge amount of money.  
These three groups currently include 275,000 participants. 
Some have retired, so that makes around 160,000. 
Then there are 52,000 surviving spouses as well.  
With proper management, we could give workers several years' break from contributing. 
Were there any negotiations with anyone? 
This is another disguised theft the Liberal government is preparing to commit.  
He described this as robbery, as abuse.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
I feel quite comfortable on this side with the cowboys.  
It will increase the employees' premiums from 30% to 40%. 
This massive surplus has accumulated so quickly for several reasons. 
Since salaries were frozen, inflation was no longer a concern. 
This is money that belongs to the taxpayers. 
Taxpayers will not benefit by having this money forfeited to the federal government. 
There is another reason for opposing this bill. 
Does that include common law relationships between a man and woman? 
Does it include relationships between cohabiting same sex partners? 
Could it include two roommates? 
Taxpayers are the odd man out in this debate. 
It has already cost the taxpayer over $20 billion. 
It is high time that the taxpayer is shown some respect. 
The hon. member from Mississauga earlier said that there were only 15 amendments. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Several of the amendments that are proposed in this group were presented by Reform. 
These motions deal pretty much with accountability.  
We have to wonder why it is not.  
I do not think the government should vote against this amendment. 
All we are asking for is a reasonable degree of openness in this regard.  
Again it is asking for more accountability.  
With Motion No. 16 all we are asking for is openness and accountability. 
I do not believe that this government should oppose these amendments. 
It is not providing the answers. 
I believe it has invoked time allocation 51 times. 
It is a standard about which the government should be completely ashamed. 
I will talk more about that a little later.  
It wants to take $30 billion out of the public service pension plan. 
That is completely unacceptable.  
It is really hard to understand. 
It has balanced the budget, eliminated the deficit, on the basis of tax increases. 
There have been incredible increases in the amount of taxation.  
Now we have a balanced budget due to the increase in taxes. 
We would think that the tax grab would stop. 
That is an unacceptable development. 
So far that has been rejected by the government. 
These are not concepts I have heard first from these people. 
I have heard them from people across the country. 
Is that a democracy functioning as it should? 
Those people have recognized that and they are very concerned about it.  
It is forced through for two main reasons. 
These issues are kept within the confines of this House. 
Then they use their whips to whip their members into line.  
Watch the voting record on the groups of amendments we are debating today. 
I think they should be ashamed of themselves.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Why do I refer to the fact that he is the member for Hull-Aylmer? 
What distress me is that he takes them for granted. 
We will recall the Mulroney years, before this government took office. 
This shows once again how arrogant the Liberal government is.  
The Minister of Finance is still very much involved in the shipping industry.  
Let us not forget that the Minister of Finance- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He may continue, without referring to a vote held in the House.  
The member for Bourassa is a master at this. 
He was in the lobby and came back for a few seconds. 
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Like you, I am only too pleased to follow procedure. 
He has no business saying what he said. 
I believe that what we have here is an argument, not a point of order.  
The Speaker asked him to lower his voice.  
I am not, therefore, tempted to get into a debate with him. 
Anyway, we are getting to know the member for Bourassa. 
Those listening to us know what he is like. 
I will continue, systematically and seriously, the speech I began earlier.  
We should just let him sleep on, or go on home-.  
These are astronomical sums, to put it mildly. 
I am sorry to have to interrupt the hon. member, but his time is up.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We heard nasty words last week. 
We heard the word ``collabo'', and now we hear the word ``agitator''. 
I am concerned for the members opposite.  
This is not a point of order. 
This is a matter of debate.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Some will hear but few will listen.  
I feel it is imperative that this board be made up of qualified individuals. 
The board cannot be made up of political appointees. 
This is not the place for more public trough feeding. 
In turn, the board must be accountable for its investment decisions. 
During this parliament, the government has purportedly balanced the books. 
Where is the plan? 
This bill is akin to the signing of a blank cheque. 
I would ask my hon. colleagues to tell us the plan. 
Foolish spending today will certainly cause problems in the future. 
The financial strain on the pension fund will continue to grow, not shrink.  
Surely this is a recipe for disaster. 
This is not being fiscally responsible. 
Bill C-78 only adds to the fancy bookkeeping. 
The union representatives state that it is unconscionable that the government would seize the surplus. 
They are calling this a unilateral decision. 
I have several other concerns regarding Bill C-78. 
Why should the same rules not apply to all legislation? 
In conclusion, I have many concerns with Bill C-78. 
I am concerned with the way the board is being set up. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
The purpose of this bill is to make changes to public sector pension plans. 
The Bloc Quebecois is obviously against this bill.  
He said, and I quote: 
It is a rip-off.  
The Bloc Quebecois has always said the same thing about pension plans. 
They must not be changed to the detriment of seniors. 
Seniors have always spoken out strongly.  
The consultation of government's partners over several months was a failure. 
So there was no agreement on the necessary reforms.  
Seniors are no fools. 
This board cannot be independent of the government. 
Bill C-78 does not move in that direction. 
Pensioners want to be treated fairly. 
The surplus should belong to both the employer and the employees.  
As I said earlier, it is a rip-off. 
Losses can also be incurred on the stock market. 
Let us recall the ``Goodbye Charlie Brown'' episode, under the Mulroney government. 
Seniors should get everything they are entitled to. 
A commemorative stamp is not enough.  
The amendments the Bloc Quebecois has moved are needed to correct this flaw.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We need to go back in history. 
The pension plan was constructed a number of years ago. 
It was based on interest rates, inflation and salary increases. 
Does that surplus in that pension plan belong to the government? 
The surplus belongs to the people who paid into the plan. 
We should maintain that surplus. 
One such issue is privatization. 
The bill does that, and this is what we support.  
My colleague mentioned something called a designated partnership.  
PSAC has been very adamant about not supporting the bill. 
The surplus is being reorganized in a very questionable fashion. 
It is taking it from the workers and putting it somewhere else.  
In Victoria the cost of living is very high. 
The accommodation assistance allowance would be non-taxable. 
RCMP wages have plummeted to the bottom of the barrel. 
They do not have the money to prosecute serious criminals. 
The reason is that the resources are not there for them to do the job.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
There was no doubt in their mind about that.  
Of course, there are several categories of retired public servants. 
I asked Mrs. Smith how much a retired public servant gets. 
She gave me a few examples. 
With 30 years of service, that annual pension is $15,000. 
These are gross, not net figures.  
These houses have not been maintained or renovated.  
It was the same everywhere. 
But all these recommendations were naturally shelved. 
The government did not want to hear them. 
The government is benefiting in all sorts of ways. 
And they certainly were not asking whether their pension plan was well run. 
They trusted their employer, but it failed them miserably. 
We never had cause to complain about our federal public servants. 
All workers pay into the fund, but very few receive benefits. 
Once again, the government has grabbed the surpluses. 
This is misappropriation of funds. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I believe it is well over 50 amendments.  
I just wanted to mention that off the top.  
Well, they may listen but they are not actually going to do anything about them. 
That is quite obvious.  
I hear members from the Tory party agreeing. 
Why in the world would we believe that given the record of the Liberal government? 
I am going to point out something which I think is obvious to all people. 
Unfortunately it is not even that for many folks. 
Fifty-five thousand dollars is a large sum of money. 
It is shocking to hear where the government spent this money. 
How could this happen? 
The Liberal government dedicated $55,000 of taxpayers' dollars to that expenditure.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are talking about Bill C-78. 
We are talking about the superannuation act. 
The parliamentary secretary is correct. 
We are debating a series of amendments to the act. 
Members' remarks should somehow be relevant to the amendments to the bill. 
If so, we are all looking forward to hearing it.  
We do not seem to be on the same wave length here. 
There are a series of amendments before the House. 
It is not a point of this debate.  
I think the point has been made. 
I think that is a relevant point.  
It must defend that record because it is the government. 
It is our job as opposition members to point out the record of the government. 
This is a clear example of a waste of taxpayers' dollars. 
It has nothing to do with the amendments.  
I will say it for the third time. 
And it should be.  
The member on the opposition side says that it should be embarrassing. 
Absolutely it should be embarrassing. 
I think that as parliamentarians we are embarrassed by it. 
How could that possibly have happened?  
I cannot understand it.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
I understand that we are dealing with a group of motions this afternoon. 
I certainly stand in full support of those valuable recommendations.  
I know the government knows it is a closely watched debate. 
That is why it has introduced closure. 
As I said, the surplus stands in excess of $30 billion.  
Where in the world is the equity in that proposition? 
We have seen this movie. 
The member for Dewdney-Alouette was talking about movies. 
It put none of that money in. 
The people who are primarily left in the lurch are women. 
Again, that is not the low end. 
That was then and this is now. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
At least that is what I would suggest the title should be.  
Let us look at who it is taking this money from. 
That was absolutely unacceptable. 
They are very frustrated with what is going. 
In that city there is a fairly large detachment of RCMP officers. 
The government will not allocate the funds to train people. 
There are four vacant positions in Sidney, the community in which I live. 
Morale is very low. 
What is the government going to do to add insult to injury? 
It is going to raid their money. 
That is absolutely unacceptable.  
Thirty per cent of the pension plan fund is funded by the members. 
It is their money and the government is confiscating it. 
When the government does things like this it is clearly embarrassed about it. 
It is not putting up speakers. 
Because the government is embarrassed. 
The government treats those people like the musical ride and nothing more. 
It makes them go around in circles and they do not get anything out. 
What is the government doing now? 
These are the facts. 
Why is the government so silent? 
Because it is absolutely embarrassed about it.  
There is a very simple solution to this. 
The Reform Party has put forward numerous amendments. 
We will watch when they come up for debate. 
My colleague from Alberta put forward these amendments. 
There are a number of them. 
Who has balanced the budget? 
Who else is the government robbing? 
It is robbing the Canadian forces plan of $12.9 billion. 
It is stealing their pension money. 
I will retract that.  
Mr. Speaker, I will retract that. 
But the government is taking their money. 
That is so dead wrong. 
They have to be held accountable. 
They have grounded all boats. 
They have grounded the drug squads in Vancouver. 
They have cancelled overtime. 
It is not acceptable.  
At the very same time, what is the government doing? 
We have seen examples. 
The list goes on and on. 
It is outrageous that the government can even consider this.  
Members of the RCMP are not laughing. 
The PSAC members are not laughing. 
They are watching this. 
Members of the Canadian forces are not laughing. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
And it is holding the line on that. 
Now we have another bill that is completely in the government's favour.  
Thousands of people and billions of dollars are involved here. 
Overall, there are some 275,000 contributors to the pension fund. 
This $30 billion surplus directly affects government employees. 
On the face of it, the government has made an effort. 
He said the work had been productive.  
This is what the regulations provide.  
This is simple, but fair. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Why are our taxes so high? 
We would start by cutting most of the heritage department. 
What a tragic milestone for the 60th anniversary of the National Film Board:
Bubbles Galore , award winner of the Freakzone International Festival of Trash Cinema. 
Need I say more?  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last week was National Elizabeth Fry Week.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Bravo Donat and keep up the good work.  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
These and other solutions are in Reform's opposition report. 
The work has been done. 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
The government also created two programs to help and support the regions.  
The second program, Initiative regionale strategique, is also designed to help the regions. 
This program has two components. 
The first one is geared to technological development. 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Liberals favourite yesman is up to his old tricks again. 
The hon. member did not stop there. 
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
They are here full of hot air. 
On the streets they are full of hot air and nothing else.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, human poverty is more than income poverty. 
It is the denial of choices and opportunities for living a tolerable life. 
Let us mark the millennium by being a leader among the G-8 nations.  
Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, May 10 to 16 is Nursing Week. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
I applaud the Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union for its ongoing efforts. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Here is a short extract: 
I have come from the shadows 
to breathe in the light.  
I know that we must 
bind up the wounds of so many wrongs.  
That we must pay the price 
of so much madness, 
those who steal freedom 
and stifle the cries.  
We will no longer die 
We will find expression 
for our collective solitude 
that keep us apart.  
And in the night through 
we will kindle the memory 
of a world not yet born.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
The public right was also encapsulated in the Magna Carta. 
The right to fish belongs to the people, not to the sovereign or her government. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Our fishers deserve to be protected by a well equipped coast guard. 
I call upon the government to reinvest resources in this program.  
SUPREME COURT OF CANADA 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I do not see any reason to make any changes.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the public does not share the view of the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about consultation. 
It is a closed shop today.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government has followed a process for three years. 
We will accept whatever consensus is reached in the House.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There have been consultations with all the provinces. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raised a point of view, an opinion.  
There are arguments against the hon. member's opinion. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We, on this side, want superior service. 
This is why we are proposing amendments to the legislation. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the refugees are here on a minister's permit. 
Their intent is to return to Kosovo.  
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
They are highly vulnerable.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
This fee is not intended to be a tax. 
It is intended to cover costs of processing applications. 
I can assure the House of that.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Canadians are paying more taxes than they have ever paid before. 
It is taxpayers' money.  
When will he give that money back to the taxpayers? 
Why can we not have tax freedom day today in Canada?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
As the hon. member knows, we have cut taxes substantially. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Health care and education. 
What a joke, Mr. Speaker. 
Canadians are paying the highest taxes in Canadian history. 
The minister is sitting on the biggest surplus in Canadian history. 
When will he give that money back to the people he took it from?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, health care and education are not a joke. 
They are part of the social fabric of the country. 
That is one of the fundamental differences between ourselves and Reform. 
Second, we are generating surpluses. 
Think what a difference- 
The hon. Minister of Finance, if he wishes to continue.  
Mr. Speaker, I have not seen a movie since The Full Monty . 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I take this matter very seriously. 
This is the first escape from Kingston in 41 years. 
It is a very serious situation.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
That is an interesting thing that happened here today.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Why does he not just give some of the taxpayers' money back? 
Why does he not do it today? 
Why does he not do the right thing?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Does the hon. member not agree with that?  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Why does he not give Canadians some real tax relief? 
Give them their money back.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's facts are simply wrong. 
The fact is that personal disposable income growth is up. 
It is not down. 
Our national net worth is up. 
It is not down.  
Why will he not answer the question? 
What is he afraid of?  
This side asks the questions and that side answers them.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
In fact, China is now engaged in a series of discussions. 
The Chancellor of Germany is there on behalf of the G-8. 
To say that they will not negotiate simply is not the case.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
That is how it fixed it. 
The minister is sitting on a fat budget surplus. 
When will he give real tax relief to Canadians?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these are the facts. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
In 1997 the Canadian government spent $1,775 per person for public health care expenses. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Cut health care spending. 
Cut the transfers to the provinces. 
Cut the social fabric to eliminate the deficit''.  
The Reform Party has not had a balanced approach on any issue. 
It has been scorch and burn all the way. 
That is why it is at 6% in Ontario.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The program's integrity is important to a good manager.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
They have done a remarkable job. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Revenues have grown by over $40 billion a year. 
The surplus has never been bigger.  
Where has all the money gone?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is very difficult to understand. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have had very high housing starts over the course of the last year. 
Our revenues are up because Canada is functioning very well.  
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The standing committee strengthened Bill C-32.  
The unite the right to pollute reaches a new low. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Our environment is being poisoned. 
Our children are victims of pollution. 
Every Canadian family knows of a friend or relative affected by cancer. 
The links between chemicals and disease are proven. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We endorsed that approach wholeheartedly.  
However, it is very important for us to get it right. 
Getting it right involves working with the provinces and the territories.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
He outlined a number of recommendations which I will share with my colleagues. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, one bad law plus another bad law equals an injustice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I look forward to seeing the report and reviewing the recommendations. 
However, who in the House is stonewalling? 
MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have no intention of appealing this decision.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
As we all know, our youth are our future. 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
We also have an international component. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I always answer questions from the Bloc Quebecois. 
I am always pleased to do so. 
I will therefore look at the report to which the hon. member refers. 
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
We are talking about the RCMP, the federal public service and the Canadian forces. 
Thirty billion dollars will be taken from these people.  
That statement was made in February 1998 by the President of the Treasury Board.  
It is easy to understand. 
It has taken $20 billion from that program. 
Where to go from here? 
Wherever there is a little bit of money left. 
It is now turn to its own workers and alienating them. 
It will steal $30 billion from its own employees' pension funds.  
I can do it and I will do it.  
I am a bit skeptical about this whole thing.  
This is the example it is about to set. 
It could be hazardous.  
There have been lawsuits. 
I will let my colleague from Saint-Jean elaborate on that. 
Furthermore, we are expected to say ``Thank you very much''.  
They should monitor the adoption process of this bill. 
We should keep an eye on that- 
Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
Nobody has stolen from anybody. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I ask him to be more judicious in his choice of words.  
You are indicating that I have only 30 seconds left. 
It is still stealing.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Let us talk about what it does. 
Let us ask who is affected. 
It includes everyone who has ever worked for the public service. 
The RCMP is affected. 
The widows of our public servants are affected. 
We are not talking about multimillionaires who are affected by the legislation. 
They are the ones who are affected.  
What will the legislation do to them? 
In fact she will suffer directly because of it. 
Money that could go to improve her standard of living will instead go to whom? 
Perhaps the government could answer that question for us.  
What does the bill say about priorities? 
That leaves retirees in those communities. 
Many things could be said about the legislation. 
The government does not want to do that and we have to ask why. 
Rather than do that, it closes down debate. 
We spend hours in the House on many different pieces of legislation. 
This is among the most serious. 
The bill talks to three issues. 
Third, it speaks to the government's commitment to democratic debate in an open forum. 
Sadly the government's record on that issue is a failure.  
They would just as soon be at work or at home getting their gardens ready. 
I am sure this is happening in other cities.  
They know something is fundamentally wrong. 
They know the government is taking their money. 
They know they are entitled to the benefits. 
They are just making enough money to survive. 
They want to reinvest that money in their own families and their communities. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
It is beyond me.  
And it is a surplus.  
But there is more. 
What could have happened? 
This argument was not used very often. 
Return on investments is not the only aspect to consider. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
They had some very serious comments to make.  
They helped themselves to the workers' contributions. 
Then they needed even more money and increased indirect taxes. 
They hid these increases in the budget. 
He said, and I quote: 
I stress the expression at arm's length, because it is extremely important.  
I agree with the remarks of the alliance, which said, and I quote: 
The provisions of Bill C-78 must be completely overhauled.  
Bill C-78 has a number of other shortcomings. 
This says it all. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The bill will affect the RCMP, the armed forces and federal public servants. 
It will also establish a new plan for Canada Post employees at a future time.  
In private business within Canada that is the acceptable road to go.  
This does not seem to be the infrequent case. 
It affects too many members. 
However, the government wants to use the surplus to offset the government deficit. 
There is nothing to restrict those kinds of things from happening.  
That is a major issue.  
That is an absolute must within this bill.  
The mutualization of funds is taking place in some companies. 
The question had not come up. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
This government is very consistent. 
This resulted in a surplus of some $26 billion.  
We know what the federal government did with these $26 billion. 
What do we see in this bill? 
How is the board going to be managed? 
This is the main criterion.  
One will represent public service employees. 
It is very sad to see how the government has been operating lately. 
There is nothing much positive in this bill. 
How can we get federal Liberals to listen to reason? 
There was no consultation. 
Board directors will be appointed by ministers. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I would have liked to vote in favour of the legislation. 
I cannot, however, vote in favour of this bill. 
What we are asked to vote for is not insignificant. 
I am not talking about the mandarins. 
The government says their pension funds are none of their business.  
We are talking about a total surplus of close to $30 billion. 
I will be more specific. 
There are now 275,000 contributors in these plans. 
That is a lot of people. 
There are certainly a few of those workers in your riding, Madam Speaker,. 
It is true that the word ``stealing'' is very significant. 
It is true that we should use it most sparingly. 
This is no time to be reading the newspaper. 
This is the tragedy of this bill.  
There is a term to describe this kind of practice: it is called patronage.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):

( d ) by replacing line 16 on page 54 with the following:

Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.) moved: 
That Bill C-78, in Clause 76, be amended 
( a ) by replacing lines 27 and 28 on page 53 with the following: 
That Bill C-78, in Clause 81, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 26 on page 57 with the following: 
``nor the contributor's surviving spouse or children'' 
( b ) by replacing line 41 on page 57 with the following: 
``sion Act, all surviving spouses within the meaning of'' 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The bill changes the test. 
Prior to this bill the test was fairly clear. 
There is another group that is eligible. 
This terminology is new to law. 
It may seem like a small point but it is not. 
Let me explain why.  
Think about that for a minute. 
And whose business is it anyway? 
That is where this bill is taking us. 
It seems unworkable to me. 
How will anyone know? 
What are we going to set it up? 
What is that doing? 
It is leaving it to the courts. 
Where could this take us?  
What about three people living together? 
Are they both eligible? 
Nowhere in this legislation is it defined or addressed. 
It is a recipe for confusion and litigation. 
It is very poorly drafted and very poorly thought out.  
He basically told me that the lawyers made them do it. 
I could not believe it.  
Now the courts have redefined a section in one act in government legislation.  
It just does not make sense. 
It is a poor approach to the serving of the people.  
For that reason we proposed the amendments.  
It is going to be a very minor cost. 
Of course, survivor is subject to the conjugality test.  
Having said all that, I think I have shed some light on this. 
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have four amendments in this grouping. 
In other words it will be a return to status quo. 
I want to read it into the record. 
It refers to section 25 of the act to be amended. 
They use language very carefully. 
This is a very significant step down the road. 
Let us look at the word conjugal. 
It has an ordinary English dictionary meaning. 
It is very simple. 
By the way I have checked it in French. 
It has the same meaning in French as it has in English: 
That is its definition in the Oxford English Dictionary .  
Yet the word is used. 
What about the legal definition? 
Is there a difference? 
Then it provides legal citations for that definition. 
What does that mean? 
It means relations between a husband and wife.  
There can be only one reason. 
That is right on point with same sex survivors benefits here.  
What was the decision of that court? 
It could not have been closer, which is rather interesting. 
It was a 5:4 split decision. 
Four of the judges felt that it was perfectly acceptable. 
In this sense, marriage is by nature heterosexual. 
On Egan and Nesbit the Supreme Court of Canada has spoken. 
It will open up a Pandora's box of nightmares.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I believe the government should have settled the issue in a different way. 
So we wondered what to do about it. 
There is a risk for the House. 
So there is a problem.  
This shows some lack of courage on the part of governments. 
Now, what is the situation today? 
As I said earlier, there are distortions.  
We have been trying to avoid unparliamentary language. 
We also have the opposite situation. 
That is, however, a completely personal opinion.  
I salute the Government of Quebec for having had the courage to do this. 
That would save us a lot of discussion.  
We would do well to resolve this matter once and for all.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
To its credit, the government went on the road. 
From day one I have maintained- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, that is not a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That certainly is not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, thank you for that ruling.  
I disagree with that point of view. 
I wish people would take a more generous point of view.  
However, some of the issues that were raised are quite legitimate. 
We will not have time to do that. 
There are many aspects to it that we need to investigate. 
I spoke about seniors groups. 
That group was notified the night before the committee hearing. 
It represents hundreds of thousands of superannuates. 
The night before it was to appear it was given the 200 page tome. 
Those were the terms he used. 
We could hardly lift it. 
It is the size of the Manhattan phone book. 
The parliamentary secretary thinks there was adequate time. 
I cannot say strongly enough how much I disagree.  
The money, in this case, was split evenly. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
We were elected to support and represent all Canadians.  
This is simply an issue of fairness.  
There are some people who use the phraseology ``family values''. 
Family values should be an intrinsically positive phrase. 
The supreme court has been consistent in its interpretation of the charter of rights. 
We have seen how that has evolved. 
Canadians do not want a discriminatory policy to be part of our public service.  
It is unfortunate because this is a fundamental issue of fairness. 
Populism is not the proper means through which to develop minority rights. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous agreement?  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
If members realize that they will understand the motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. parliamentary secretary have the unanimous consent of the House?  
PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I certainly echo the sentiments that have been expressed by many members here today. 
The fact of the matter is that it is effectively being changed. 
It is contrary to the wishes of people in the House.  
The motion was soundly turned down.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member has seven minutes left in his speech.  
The House resumed from March 16 consideration of the motion.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on this motion. 
When our Criminal Code was codified in 1892 this section was included. 
There has been discussion over the years. 
These two issues are linked in my mind.  
They are still ongoing. 
I believe that discussion is necessary. 
It is now the opposite. 
This is a complex area. 
It is not simple. 
I would like to see some reform on this section. 
We should not excuse violence. 
I would certainly want a very high test level.  
It really is case dependent, factual dependent. 
I commend the hon. member for her work on the motion. 
I do not wish to prolong this debate by repeating myself. 
I think I have laid where I stand clearly on the table. 
I am at this stage glad that there is one in place. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
The member for Yukon has been forthright in stating the genesis of this motion. 
On the surface it seems easy to remedy a situation of this nature. 
On the other hand everything old is not necessarily out of date. 
It says the law is not static.  
This seems a bit frivolous.  
This is not how our Criminal Code evolved. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
It is really well defined in Quebec and Canada's jurisprudence.  
I will read it because it contains all the significant elements: 
The criteria are very strict. 
It can only reduce the charge. 
In other words, the accused must have totally lost self-control. 
This is even one of the arguments that judges use in similar cases. 
The victim has a legitimate right to defend herself. 
She can plead self-defence. 
As members can see, the defence of provocation is not easily used. 
Criminal law condemns antisocial behaviour. 
The Criminal Code identify actions that do not meet with the community's approval. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
The Criminal Code is a document that is not immune to such push for change. 
This of course was an issue which our party opposed. 
I do not believe for a moment that the law is condoning violence. 
The popular will of the day does not take into account the rights of minorities. 
Judges have the wisdom from years of service. 
They have the knowledge of legal precedence. 
They have non-partisan opinions to allow for the proper interpretation of the Criminal Code.  
This is the law of the land. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Allow me to read some paragraphs regarding two cases. 
These will illustrate the reasons the hon. member for Yukon brought the motion forward. 
This motion came on the heels of the Klassen trial's outcome. 
It is a one sided debate. 
The fact is this woman is dead. 
She cannot rise from the dead and present her case to the courts. 
The courts have only one person's view on the evidence. 
What did he get? 
Can we imagine what the parents of that child are going through? 
Where is the justice in that?  
In essence it is a licence for violence. 
It reads as follows: 
Couples end relationships every day. 
Let us vote to eliminate this unjust defence which promotes violence and inequality.  
The fact is that violence against women continues today as much as it always has. 
What would the parents of the victims say? 
What message is being sent out?  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Any change could clearly have a significant impact. 
Provocation was actually relatively limited at that time. 
This assessment has to be made on the facts of each case. 
This criticism is understandable. 
Again I congratulate her. 
These problems cannot be ignored or overlooked.  
However, the speeches of other hon. members reveal other sides to this debate. 
I would suggest that this is premature. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
That often does not happen in the House. 
I am sure among ourselves we recognize that and I am sure Canadians recognize that.  
Often that is not the case with the Reform Party. 
As has been mentioned, it is very complicated. 
The sad reality of that is that Canadians have lost faith in the justice system. 
They have lost faith in the laws. 
I listened to the hon. member from the Reform Party whose son was killed. 
I understand his passion. 
However, we need to be very conscience of all the ramifications.  
People are losing faith. 
How many Canadians would even hear about it? 
The defence of provocation has been used in situations which are unconscionable to accept. 
It should not be perceived as being a crass portrayal.  
They were sorry they felt that way. 
What my colleague mentioned is true. 
Are we accepting that as a defence of provocation? 
There are faults within the system which have to be addressed. 
I want to thank my colleague. 
We are failing to give them that with the way things are happening now. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
This is dated November 4, 1987.  
Then we move to another Department of Transport report dated October 4, 1989. 
Since then new buildings have been built. 
This is the second time they will try this. 
They have said this over and over again. 
At all times air traffic controllers at the Los Angeles airport can see the runways. 
It is not the same thing and it is not safe.  
This is a safety issue. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.34 p.m.)
