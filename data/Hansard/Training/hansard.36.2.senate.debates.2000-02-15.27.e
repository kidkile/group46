The Senate met at 2 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
Honourable senators, today is Canada's Flag Day. 
Do not be shy.  
Our Olympic athletes wore it proudly as early as 1904.  
I am quoting from Mr. Pearson himself, who said: 
- the former prime minister recalled.  
The Flag is one such symbol.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted to allow the honourable senator to continue?  
We celebrate a nation filled with hope and promise. 
What unites us will always be far stronger than what divides us.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
It is a symbol of our national unity. 
Canada's flag is known universally. 
We are proud to be Canadians, and rightly so. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The other was ithe Honourable Bob Coates. 
I should like to pay tribute to those who really deserve such tributes.  
Senator Bolduc, my new seatmate, said, "You should have been here."  
Honourable senators, I wish to speak now about the Canadian flag. 
We three parliamentarians are alive and, hopefully, kicking. 
I was pleased to hear Senator Graham's words. 
What has happened to this country? 
It is totally forbidden by my doctor. 
However, I sometimes tend to get carried away. 
What has happened to this country? 
What has happened to all of us? 
What has happened to les Canadiens-francais who have given so much to Canada?  
The Late J. Angus MacLean, P.C. 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
The Honourable J. Angus MacLean attained legendary status in his home province. 
J. Angus MacLean was a truly special individual, a man I was honoured to know. 
Rarely has someone achieved such levels of success in so many different venues. 
He will be missed.  
East Timor-Use of Land Mines 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
They have said that these land mines are not indiscriminate. 
Canada passed the legislation banning land mines in November of 1997. 
This is the ultimate hypocrisy, and one that I hope can be answered.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are speakers from provincial legislatures. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The next is the Honourable George Hickes, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Two other honourable provincial speakers were here yesterday. 
They were accompanied by their clerks, whom we welcomed as well.  
I bid them all welcome on behalf of the Senate of Canada.  
Report of Committee on Study Tabled 
Aboriginal Governance in Canada."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
These petitions contain 2,607 signatures.  
Civil War in Sudan- Request for Clarification of Diplomatic Policy 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I wish to thank the honourable senator for her question. 
In response to the Harker report, he has announced a series of new Canadian initiatives. 
If so, what action will Canada take?  
Canada's interest will continue on an ongoing basis. 
At the same time, there were implementation strategies to reinforce civil society.  
If that is so, for what purpose? 
Obviously, that is totally unacceptable and deplorable. 
In excess of 4 million people have been displaced from their homes. 
Honourable senators, the minister has talked about past efforts. 
These are not new issues.  
Civil War in Sudan-Involvement of Talisman Energy Inc. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Civil War in Sudan-Human Rights Violations 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I assume that we support that resolution in general.  
Does the minister not agree?  
East Timor-Use of Land Mines 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
If so, which minister is right and which is wrong?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, a distinction must be drawn here. 
In this case, armies have weapons that kill people, and that is regrettable.  
That is my understanding.  
When is a land mine not a land mine?  
Let me put it as simply as I can, honourable senators. 
That is as clear a position as any government could ever take. 
They breached the spirit of it!  
We are talking about a public battle between Minister Axworthy and Minister Eggleton.  
On whose side is the Leader of the Government, honourable senators? 
Where does the leader stand? 
On whose side does he stand?  
No matter what they think?  
I do not think that is inconsistent.  
Why are we not surprised?  
I support Canada's continued compliance with that treaty. 
Someday, my hope is that even military helicopters might be banned.  
When you do not have any, you cannot ban them.  
That is a Liberal interpretation.  
Great Liberal interpretation is right.  
Court Martial of Sergeant Mike Kipling 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is a military judicial proceeding but, nevertheless, a judicial proceeding. 
I would be reluctant to interfere with that or even comment on it.  
Should he not be dealt with in a civilian court?  
Honourable senators, I cannot answer that question. 
I hesitate to comment.  
China-Detention of Catholic Archbishop 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I personally am always in favour of allegiance to the Pope.  
As a good Catholic, obviously.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Does the agenda include China as well?  
China-Detention of Catholic Archbishop 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is supplementary to that of Senator Di Nino. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will certainly bring that question to the minister.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Obviously, I do not run the department. 
The information I have is very succinct. 
Honourable senators, any information I provide will be as complete as possible. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Because of the job creation program?  
You put it in the pocket of the minister.  
I would take strong exception to the senator's comment.  
In those circumstances, it is a very important point to be made. 
However, I wish to make that point.  
In those cases, the program can be brought to bear, as I understand it.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I cannot respond to that question, offhand. 
Could one come to that conclusion by looking at these numbers?  
Honourable senators, of course, I am not familiar with the individual grant. 
There are about 30,000 files and I am not familiar with all of them.  
Of course not, you are busy in Nova Scotia! 
I cannot speak to individual grants. 
There are approximately 30,000 files. 
I am not familiar with all of them. 
I do not know. 
I would maintain that one cannot jump to the conclusion that the honourable senator suggests.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I find that a relatively easy question to answer. 
It happens all the time.  
They are loans, not grants.  
Personally, I feel better. 
If the business operation works, let them do it. 
They do not need government grants to make it happen. 
That is where we differ as to what these grants are all about.  
I would argue that you ought not to give money to these companies. 
If it works, they will do it. 
It did not work because the employment was not there. 
The tube mill closed down. 
If it works in a business sense, it will work. 
You do not need government money. 
Their credit rating is better than the Government of Canada's.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I call Delayed Answers to Oral Questions.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
We disagree on that point. 
I respect his views. 
I respect the position that he takes. 
However, I do not agree with it. 
Michelin employs thousands of Nova Scotians. 
It has now become the largest value exporter from our province. 
They would not have been there without government intervention. 
They have been there for decades.  
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Christie is from Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador.  
On behalf of all honourable senators, I bid you welcome here in the Senate. 
We hope that you find your week with us interesting and constructive.  
Bill to Amend-Message from Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Medical Decisions Facilitation Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Honourable Senator Lavoie-Roux ). 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Regrettably, however, she cannot be here in person. 
The first involves what we see as a major omission. 
Requiring free and informed consent is an extra protection for patients. 
Preferred legal practice would be to simply amend the Criminal Code. 
I am also a strong proponent of palliative care services. 
It is intended to provide a criminal defence. 
Each of these elements does indeed have a great deal of merit. 
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Public Service Whistle-Blowing Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
( Honourable Senator Finestone, P.C. ). 
Whistle-blowing mechanisms have already been put into place in other jurisdictions. 
The concept of whistle-blowing is relatively recent. 
The word itself dates back only to the 1960s. 
New approaches to service delivery require decentralized decision-making. 
What responsibility do individuals have to their superiors, to the public and to themselves? 
At other times, the clash of interests is not so clearly resolved. 
Even one error in these fields can have long-lasting and dramatic effects. 
Any pursuit of the employer is costly. 
What happens then to the employee? 
We are a bit late in that regard.  
A number of issues need to be given careful thought in committee.  
Therefore, this issue needs to be highlighted in our deliberations. 
We need to call appropriate witnesses in this regard.  
This kind of criteria can be somewhat subjective and open to influence of various prejudices. 
This ground for disclosure should be thoroughly defined.  
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
The police community is very supportive of the progress represented by Bill C-202. 
Honourable senators, we know that the police do not take these decisions lightly. 
Often the police must make these decisions instantaneously, without the benefit of hindsight. 
This new offence will immediately follow section 249, the dangerous driving provision. 
The maximum penalty on summary conviction would be six months' imprisonment. 
On indictment, the maximum penalty would be five years' imprisonment. 
Honourable senators, dangerous driving already attracts severe maximum penalties. 
These maximum penalties would be reserved for the worst factual circumstances and the worst offenders. 
I ask all honourable senators to give their support to Bill C-202.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Ghitter, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Fernand Robichaud (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
The petition is in favour of the release of census records after 1901.  
I ask for unanimous consent now. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
That is why we are happy to grant our consent.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to accept the petitions?  
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
That is not correct. 
I was a bit surprised at that error myself.  
The Canada in which I was born had a population of 13 million people. 
Canada's population now stands at 31 million and is expanding rapidly. 
It is a very small country.  
Our exports to Europe are of a highly technical nature. 
We are skeptical about the European Monetary Union. 
I will not take up the time of senators with that this afternoon. 
That has been the history of our country. 
The Europeans have absolutely no experience with that.  
As you know, there is the famous European Parliament. 
As well, there are the governments of the member states. 
The experience in Canada in that department has certainly been the opposite.  
In my opinion, they had not realized this. 
In fact, the opposite has taken place.  
The European Parliament has lost credibility. 
People feel distant from the central structures in Brussels. 
How will they pay for the agricultural subsidies? 
Will that be of benefit to Canada? 
Heavily subsidized European agricultural exports are competing with less-subsidized Canadian agricultural exports. 
This is a big problem for us.  
Honourable senators, would Senator Stollery answer a question?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted to continue?  
This strikes me as very healthy and represents progress of a sort. 
These governments were democratically elected.  
Honourable senators, the idea that national governments have greater political powers is a good one. 
How will this affect the financial system? 
I see contradiction in this. 
It is not because I am a pessimist. 
I see more contradiction than scepticism perhaps.  
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Second Report of Committee Adopted 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Business of the Senate 
Honourable senators, bear with me for one moment, please.  
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, to which item on the Order Paper are we speaking?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
He said Number 4. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
No, it was to go to the end of the day.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am in your hands. 
Should I give the floor to the Honourable Senator Watt?  
It is adjourned in the name of Senator Taylor. 
That is where we are on today's scroll.  
In the normal course, this report would not be up for debate until tomorrow. 
I am prepared to concede that I misunderstood. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed that we proceed in this manner?  
Francophone and Acadian Communities Outside Quebec 
Deterioration of Services-Inquiry 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Unfortunately, they have had to think again in recent years.  
Honourable senators, deficit reduction efforts did not spare my province. 
The recommendations are, for the most part, directed at the federal and provincial governments. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The present Minister of Defence in relation to both matters; 
2. Former Ministers of National Defence in relation to both matters; 
6. The then special advisor to the Minister of National Defence (J. 
Dixon) in relation to the Somalia occurrence; 
That the Committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
It is as simple as that.  
A brief summary of what prompts the main thrust of this motion is in order. 
The commission was never allowed to complete its mandate. 
This report ... now addresses, in some sense, every paragraph of our original terms of reference. 
It has compromised our search for the truth. 
The careful search for truth can be painstaking and, at times, frustrating. 
Only by a public inquiry can this be done.  
I have given many similar examples in the past. 
The Swiss did not embark on this self-examination entirely voluntarily. 
The banks, in turn, hid behind secrecy laws. 
With mixed motives, no doubt, Switzerland is now confronting its past. 
To do so is far from easy.  
His obituary in the National Post is worth being part of our record: 
He was never bitter, and never held a grudge against the military.  
Mr. Riordan directed that his body be subjected to an autopsy. 
According to The Globe and Mail - and I say with this without comment: 
If such is the agreement, I certainly raise no objections. 
It is without much enthusiasm that the method of inquiry is proposed.  
However, this is mere detail compared with what is at stake. 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Honourable senators, might the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton entertain a question?  
Of course, honourable senators.  
Motion No. 7 states, in part: 
Several matters are listed in the motion. 
Again, it states, in part: 
- report on two significant matters which involve the conduct of - 
It runs on from there and talks about decision making and administrative problems. 
At the end of the motion, it is stated: 
I agree that the wording leads to some confusion.  
We do not really know anything about these matters. 
Parliament should be a participant in the events leading to the results.  
It is to help those Canadians, some of whom we know. 
They were already lined up to appear as witnesses. 
This has been before the Senate for nearly three years. 
I was hoping to speak to it earlier. 
I hope other senators will also speak to the issue.  
I believe the intent is clear. 
On motion of Senator Bryden, debate adjourned.  
Report of Committee on Study-Debate Adjourned 
Leave having been given to revert to Reports of Committees: 
Honourable senators, this is an interesting time and an interesting place.  
The report includes a recommendation in this regard.  
However, they will require, in some instances, the reallocation of existing resources. 
However, our witnesses also drew attention to a wider set of issues.  
We hope to be able to pursue those issues in our future work.  
On motion of Senator Johnson, debate adjourned.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, February 16, 2000, at 1:30 p.m.
