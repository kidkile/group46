Committee Authorized to Meet During Sittings of the Senate 
Tuesday, February 2, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Honourable Peter Bosa 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Rest in peace, dear friend.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
It was these characteristics which ruled his heart and guided his feet.  
One never had to guess about Senator Bosa's political loyalties. 
We thank this thoughtful and gentle Canadian for his friendship and his guidance. 
Senator continued in Italian - Translation follows.)  
Thank you, Pietro, for the time you spent with us...  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, it is obvious how fond we were of Senator Bosa. 
I have lost a personal friend. 
The Honourable Peter Bosa was his special assistant.  
Peter Bosa guided me through the bureaucratic mazes of immigration. 
After that, our paths took different directions.  
I know his family very well. 
It was an extraordinary visit. 
Recently, Peter, his son, and his wife and I returned to Korea. 
We visited South and North Korea together.  
We shall miss our friend. 
To him, it was a great honour. 
He always conducted himself with honour. 
He participated in this chamber fully. 
On a personal note, Peter was a friend. 
We would discuss at length the great issues of the world.  
He never forgot that. 
My friends on the other side know well what a challenge that can be. 
He will be sadly missed and he will never be forgotten.  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
He became a proud Canadian who remained equally proud of his Italian heritage. 
It is Canada who should be proud of him.  
He then decided to seek new horizons. 
In February 1977, he was appointed national chairman of the Canadian Consultative Council on Multiculturalism. 
In April of that year, he was summoned to the Senate.  
For that, I will be forever grateful.  
He was truly a special person. 
Senator Bosa was unfailingly good-natured. 
He had a delightful sense of humour.  
We were involved in a bit of political manoeuvring at the time. 
It was a most interesting time for all of us. 
Always a gentleman, he was nice about it. 
Peter Bosa personified modesty. 
He always focused on the other person, to ask, "How are you doing?" 
He was always ready with an encouraging word.  
Yes, Peter was above all a man of the people. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Vico studied history through a particular prism. 
Each culture had unique, unduplicateable contributions to make to the ideas of history and civilization.  
In its essence, Vico's work was the first modern dialectic of cultural pluralism. 
It became a part of Italy only in 1866. 
Finally, it became part of the Italian Republic.  
They chose, to a large measure, Canada. 
Peter loved his family, his community Canada. 
He had a European aesthetic sense.  
He read widely and deeply. 
We became fast friends. 
His contributions to the Senate have been noted by others. 
Suffice it to say that he carried this honour with ease and distinction.  
Peter was a gentle man; in all respects wise. 
Peter loved all things Italian. 
He loved making wine. 
He loved the Senate in all its works. 
He remained a man of gentle persuasion and gentility. 
Last spring, it had been 21 years that Peter was my seatmate.  
He obviously enjoyed it. 
We went out on the land on our four-wheeled Hondas. 
It was very rough and muddy. 
Mark, his son, was driving, and Peter was on the back of the machine. 
We slept two nights in a tent. 
I know he enjoyed himself very much. 
We slept in an igloo on the 1st of April, in Igloolik.  
I offer his family my sincere condolences.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
(Honourable senators then stood in silent tribute) 
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is a pleasure to see you all - and all of our staff - back.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I am speaking of the legislation relating to split-run magazines. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, February is Black History Month. 
What did he tell us then? 
The multicultural community of Canada wants action. 
Canada's multicultural community is watching. 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
Growth of Population and Economy-Protection of Quality of Life 
Both major cities and the other smaller centres are riding a wave of change.  
Annual Report of Parliamentary Librarian Tabled 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Report of Special Committee- Confirmation of Tabling-Motion for Consideration 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, with leave, I move, seconded by Honourable Senator Graham: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the question raised by my honourable friend is very timely. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am not aware of any projections of that nature, honourable senators.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, problems with the EI fund are well known. 
Only one-third of the unemployed now qualify for benefits. 
Is it the reduced benefit rate? 
Is it the shorter benefit period? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I anticipate that the review will be completed in the near future. 
I will attempt to bring forward an answer as soon as possible.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is a valid question as well. 
That meeting will take place at 24 Sussex on Thursday of this week.  
I am sure that those points and other matters will be discussed at the meetings. 
I would be happy to bring forward a report following those meetings.  
Delayed Answer to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
We have Sheizana Murji from Calgary, Alberta. 
Isabelle Chartrand, of Orleans, Ontario, is studying at the University of Ottawa. 
She is registered in the Faculty of Administration and is specializing in international management.  
Notice of Motion to Permit Committee of the Whole to Extend Date of Final Report 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Wednesday, February 3, 1999, I will move: 
Carriage By Air Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
That is a long official title, honourable senators. 
To this end, it permits the use of electronic means to send shipping slips. 
Recently, Parliament dealt with legislation pertaining to marine liability. 
We are now proposing to move in the area of air carrier liability. 
On motion of Senator Roberge, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
American preclearance operations in Canada have operated effectively for over 40 years. 
Traffic has risen dramatically as has the number of routes. 
The legislation also offers Canadian legal protections for travellers. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Buchanan, debate adjourned.  
Child Custody and Access Reform 
Consideration of Report of Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
The committee held 55 meetings and heard from 520 witnesses. 
However, I will do my best.  
Others may think it went too far. 
At times, I found listening to the testimony to be a heart-wrenching experience. 
They also respond to some of the concerns expressed by other members of divorced families. 
After all, parents divorce each other, not their children.  
This would include school and medical records. 
it is time we listened.  
On motion of Senator Cohen, debate adjourned.  
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Child labour and prostitution have increased as a result. 
Most experts expect these figures to increase.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
However, sometimes we need to remind ourselves about the greater reality. 
Is this notion of Canada realistic?  
Our economy is not nearly as strong as it needs to be. 
Our health care system is in trouble today. 
...the worst social policy initiative undertaken by the federal government in more than a generation.  
The level of child poverty in our country is a national disgrace. 
Honourable senators, these statistics serve as a wake-up call. 
"Family violence" is characterized by the Muriel McQueen Fergusson Foundation as: 
...the most insidious, widespread disease of our society. 
It is largely under-reported. 
Family violence is all too prevalent in Canada. 
Consider the following startling statistics: 
One-half of these women were severely assaulted.  
Abuse does not stop with age. 
Family violence often turns deadly. 
Almost one-half of family homicides involved spouses. 
Men have been more likely than women to kill their spouses. 
Some kids abuse their parents. 
Honourable senators, statistics are only one side of the family violence story. 
This, of course, is emotional abuse.  
Children who witness abuse are at greater risk of being abused themselves. 
For them, life on the street was safer than life at home.  
The cycle of abuse can be broken. 
Not all victims of abuse go on to abuse. 
Victimization does not cause family abuse but it is a contributing factor. 
I have illustrated that it is widespread. 
We have a very long way to go. 
She certainly is missed in our province. 
The centre is the only family violence research centre in the Atlantic region. 
I will just mention four groups that are pursuing innovative initiatives. 
I also want to commend Caring Partnership Communities. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
May I have one minute longer?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is the lesson that Senator Muriel McQueen Fergusson taught us. 
If first we take personal responsibility, each of us can make an important difference. 
Again, I should like to thank Senator Carstairs for initiating this inquiry. 
I hope that we will be vigilant in keeping an eye on it.  
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
In the issue of Hustler , Ms Copps is made the subject of an obscene contest. 
Honourable senators, Ms Copps is a minister of the Crown. 
Indeed, we have several measures before us right now. 
The government is represented in this place by a minister. 
We often engage in pre-study. 
On page 123, May further states: 
On page 124 it states: 
Obstruction must be connected to parliamentary work... and be occasioned by improper means.  
This next statement is important. 
On September 17, 1994, The Globe and Mail carried an article which read: 
Ottawa shuts out U.S. sex magazine:
Split-run edition of Hustler contravenes policy of protecting domestic industry.  
"We've just been told we're not allowed. 
On January 15, the Boston Globe carried the headline: 
US-Canada rift imperils trade pacts.  
This type of attack on one member of Parliament affects all parliamentarians. 
It could have a chilling effect on the work of all of us. 
I invite honourable senators to examine this matter. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I do not know the names of the Canadian advertisers. 
I should like to ask another question of the honourable senator. 
I believe there was a case in 1906. 
I want to know who they are. 
If that information could be provided, it would be most helpful.  
Honourable senators, I do not know the names of the publishers in Canada. 
However, I am sure we can find that out very easily. 
I believe it appears on the inside of the magazine. 
I wish to say something else on this point. 
They got tied up in their business. 
I cannot judge why they do what they do or do not do. 
I am also unaware if they are under the same time restraints as we are.  
I could not find any comparable to this issue. 
In recent memory, we have had some dealings with allegations of slander. 
Usually, it involves a personal attack. 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
I believe that one point in particular requires further consideration. 
However, I cannot confirm whether that is true. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I would thank Senator Kinsella for bringing forward this question of privilege. 
As you know, this is a subject matter that is close to my heart.  
I do not read Hustler magazine, honourable senators. 
We have been shirking our duty on many of these issues. 
It is dangerous to life and limb, not only reputation. 
This is a matter which concerns us all. 
I believe it shames us all and, most important, it shames Parliament.  
It is clear that this particular citation speaks to Parliament as a whole.  
There is one Parliament; it is indivisible. 
It has two houses, but Parliament is indivisible.  
We have one Minister of Canadian Heritage, and that is Minister Sheila Copps.  
I scrambled to assemble these notes in the last several moments.  
They are claimed on behalf of the citizens of Canada.  
That is the issue that is before us at this very moment.  
I wish to do that. 
Its title is "An Act respecting advertising services supplied by foreign periodical publishers." 
Honourable senators, I would have loved some more time to prepare. 
It is a technique that is used again and again in our community today. 
I can tell honourable senators that I have had first-hand experience with it. 
I am quite moved that this subject has been raised by a man.  
Hustler is, God knows, not a respectable publication. 
However, we do have laws to control the general operation of the press. 
There are libel laws. 
There are laws against hate propaganda. 
I would be very distressed to see us set such a precedent.  
May I ask the honourable senator a question? 
An interesting argument has been made, with far-reaching implications. 
I was not suggesting a class action, senator. 
In all similar cases?  
That was not the basis of your argument before.  
Would the honourable senator accept another question?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
It is quite clear that what we have before us is a very offensive article. 
Like most of you, perhaps not all of you, I have not read it. 
I have, however, read about it. 
Yes, it is highly offensive. 
It is a Solomon-like task, Your Honour, that we are asking you to undertake.  
Was this an attempt to influence the vote? 
That, sir, is the decision you must make.  
The issue before us, therefore, is a difficult one. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does he have a copy of the article?  
I would be happy to table what I have here, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I will obtain it from the library. 
The matter is under advisement, and I shall report as soon as I can.  
History of the Chinese in Canada 
Hon. Vivienne Poy rose pursuant to notice of December 8, 1998: 
It is the story of the Chinese Canadians. 
The group consisted of 50 to 70 labourers, carpenters and shipwrights. 
They arrived in Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, in early June. 
The fate of the Chinese carpenters and shipwrights was a mystery. 
According to some accounts, they were captured by Spaniards and taken to Mexico. 
Whatever the case, within a generation or two their identities were lost. 
Up to 90 per cent of the peasants lost their land. 
However, the kidnapping continued.  
In the first eight months of 1850, 50,000 Chinese men emigrated to California. 
Many Chinese also went into service industries for the mining towns. 
Victoria became the main centre for Chinese immigrants in North America.  
In 1860, the London Times wrote that: 
- that is, the Chinese - 
An article in the Victoria British Colonist in 1861 stated: 
On July 20, 1871, British Columbia became a province of Canada. 
In May 1873, the first anti-Chinese society was established in Victoria.  
The Leader of the Opposition, Alexander MacKenzie, stated: 
Chinese labourers were paid half the wages of white labourers. 
According to Sir Matthew Begbie, Chief Justice of British Columbia: 
I do not see how people would get on here at all without Chinamen. 
Prime Minister Macdonald frankly told the House of Commons, in 1883: 
Many people died building the railway. 
This means that two Chinese workers died for every mile of the railway. 
Living conditions were so poor that no medical attention was given to the Chinese. 
Many headed towards the Prairies and Eastern Canada. 
A thousand went back to China. 
Most stayed in B.C. 
The tax was increased to $100 in 1900.  
In 1895, the Chinese Board of Trade was formed in Vancouver.  
In 1907, anti-Asian riots swept through Vancouver's Chinatown. 
Speakers at the rally called for a white Canada. 
Wherever the Chinese went, discrimination followed. 
I now turn to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923. 
During the Second World War, 500 Chinese men served in the Canadian army. 
When World War II broke out, Jung and his brothers enlisted. 
No other Canadian military formation had received such a high proportion of decorations.  
In the same year, they regained their right to vote. 
However, attitudes are much more difficult to change. 
Attitudes are difficult to change. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sittings of the Senate 
Hon. Charlie Watt , pursuant to notice of December 9, 1998, moved: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion as amended?  
Motion, as amended, agreed to.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, February 3, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
