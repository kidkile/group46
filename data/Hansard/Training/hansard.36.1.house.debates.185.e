EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 185 
Friday, February 19, 1999 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
This is mismanagement by the minister. 
She is mismanaging her priorities. 
We should welcome genuine refugees. 
They deserve our protection. 
The Liberals have no political will to improve the situation. 
You had not let anyone come in. 
It had been left wide open. 
Drug dealers come here to sell drugs to our children.  
Canada is a country of immigrants. 
Genuine immigrants should be welcomed through the front door. 
Rather, it wants to make patchwork changes to the Citizenship Act. 
It is four and a half years- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
We are supposed to be debating an act respecting Canadian citizenship. 
This has been happening continually from that side of the House. 
They have not been talking about the citizenship- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We have been through this a number of times now. 
If the Liberal government members do not like it, that is just too darn bad.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Standing Order 101(2) speaks to relevancy. 
During debate we do have to be germane to the issues at debate. 
We need to give each other a little elbow room.  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
It is a citizenship bill. 
Twenty-seven million people in this country are Canadian citizens. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. parliamentary secretary has made his point.  
This is an act respecting Canadian citizenship. 
I was on clause 2(1) under interpretations. 
That is why it does not want to listen to what I am saying.  
He was tortured for his religious beliefs. 
After he arrived in Canada, his brother was tortured and killed by the police. 
Now his wife and children are being harassed and tortured. 
A day is too long for him to wait. 
My constituent is under tremendous pressure and mental torture.  
Why is it this way? 
The Liberal government is responsible for this mess. 
That is what we are talking about today.  
As Canadians we want to welcome genuine refugees to our country. 
We want to help those people who need the help. 
It almost doubled in two years. 
The Liberals continue to make Canadians wait for changes.  
Fairness and efficiency are legitimate and important objectives. 
Instead we are going back to changes in the Citizenship Act. 
It is already too late for many of those who are victims of crime. 
The minister has been in her portfolio for three years. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Everyone needs a history reminder once in a while.  
The Government of Canada passed the first anti-Chinese bill in 1885. 
Canadian citizenship is an enviable status in the world community. 
This is distasteful and should be changed. 
My colleagues have pointed out many of these shortcomings.  
I will now get into some of the specifics of Bill C-63. 
It has been billed as a major reform but it really does not do that. 
The official opposition calls for reinstatement of this provision.  
This may as well be called the minister's oath. 
It was not done in the public domain with public input. 
We missed a grand opportunity. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I have an understanding of what an absolutely wonderful thrill that was. 
Unfortunately Bill C-63 is a bit of a bureaucratic nightmare. 
I also have concerns regarding the oath of allegiance. 
The concern that is often neglected in the aspect of citizenry is our aboriginal people. 
They were the first citizens of this country. 
We talk about two founding nations in this country. 
We actually have three and they were the first. 
It is really a hardship on new immigrants who come to this country. 
I find that wrong. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
These 80 Hondurans are criminal refugee claimants. 
They are not genuine immigrants. 
These very same people are arrested over and over again every week. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is important that we have some relevancy. 
What the member is talking about and what the Reform- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for North Vancouver.  
They have begged the minister to deal with them. 
I have already given some examples.  
So the immigration deportation process cannot start up. 
The person can wander around the streets, commit another crime and go back to jail. 
This process is repeated over and over again. 
Thousands of people are doing it in the Vancouver area. 
For an unknown reason the minister is ignoring the problem. 
I could not have come here if I was against immigration. 
But what I stand for is a quality in immigration. 
Now the immigration department is captive of its own system. 
It is not done in a proactive way to find people we really need.  
We did an inquiry. 
What did we find out? 
This man married someone he had never met. 
He had never seen the women. 
He had never been to the town she lived in. 
He could not produce any wedding photographs. 
Someone else stood in for him so all the photographs were of someone else. 
Last week an Iranian man called me. 
He already had a sponsorship list of five people he wanted to bring in. 
What sort of nonsense is this? 
A person does not know who he wants to sponsor into the country? 
There was a huge amount of money changing hands. 
It gives us an idea of the sort of problem.  
He had actually kidnapped someone in Canada. 
It is absolutely ridiculous.  
He had committed a crime in Montreal and had been deported twice. 
It is absolutely amazing what is going on.  
Then of course they get found out. 
One would think that it would be an easy job to deport them. 
It is impossible to deport them. 
On average it takes 10 to 12 years to get that done.  
As members can tell I am just getting warmed up. 
I will try to sum this up in the last minute I have. 
He had paid about $15,000 for them, $1.50 for each Canadian citizenship card. 
Even here in Ottawa the RCMP is constantly confiscating false passports.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
It therefore gives me great pleasure to speak to this proposed legislation.  
Just last month we signed up 360 new citizens. 
I would like to outline some of the details of Bill C-63.  
The report was entitled ``Not Just Numbers:
A Canadian Framework for Future Immigration''. 
We need to hear from organizations representing our immigrant community. 
I would now like to review some of the substances of the legislation. 
The residency test is changed in two significant ways. 
Minimum residency requirements may be waived on compassionate grounds. 
Such a decision would remain in effect for five years. 
Instead applications shall be decided by departmental officers. 
The salaries and benefits of the position will remain the same.  
Bill C-63 changes the oath of citizenship. 
By and large these changes appear welcome and somewhat overdue. 
The intent of Bill C-63 is positive. 
The devil is often in the details. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
In fact things are spiralling out of control. 
Let me talk about some of the problems that are taking place. 
As are other members of the House, I am an immigrant to this country. 
What kind of immigration policy is that?  
This needs to be fixed. 
Let us talk about some scams. 
When I was delivering a baby I learned of another scam. 
That is not good immigration. 
If those provisions were included this loophole would be blocked. 
Also the loophole with respect to adoption needs to be blocked.  
The minister can do a number of things. 
My colleague from Vancouver mentioned the issue of the oath of allegiance. 
That would have made the oath of allegiance, the oath of citizenship, meaningful. 
She failed once again.  
We have to build an immigration policy that focuses on the independent class of immigrants. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, every sport needs its superstars. 
Harness racing has a superstar family. 
He is a Hall of Famer. 
He is a Hall of Famer.  
He is what any sport craves. 
Randy Waples is dashing, dedicated and driven to succeed. 
One day Randy Waples will be a Hall of Famer.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
These environmental organizations do not care about facts. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
Their success has been made possible by the support of parents, volunteers and corporate citizenship. 
I wish to recognize and thank all these people for their hard work and dedication.  
CANADA 1999 WINTER GAMES 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
It is a great event.  
The event is going to be a great celebration. 
TSN and RDS are going to be providing 50 hours of live broadcast time.  
I want to say thank you to the federal government for all of its support.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
By doing so, the government is honouring its commitments to the rural community.  
MATHIEU DA COSTA AWARDS 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
This year's winners of the awards are:
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
As the Indonesian president, BJ Habibie, recently said ``Give them freedom. 
It is just and fair''.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
The Tory leader is weary of the united alternative for good reason. 
The only Tories at this convention will be reformatories and that dog won't hunt.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
They will be gathering here to revitalize Canadian democracy. 
They know they lost the election in eight of the ten provinces. 
The hon. member for Mississauga West.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
There once was a party named Reform, 
Representing anything but the norm, 
So to find their roots, 
They've put on their boots, 
And the united alternative was born.  
It seems the first meeting will be the last, 
Although the weekend should be a blast, 
It's off to Ottawa they go, 
Sadly looking for Joe, 
But stuck with the same old cast.  
Many will go to the ball, 
Including two Tories in all, 
And to observe this mess, 
The Liberals send their best, 
Who will likely go up the wall.  
``To unite, to fight'', 
Is the cry of the right, 
And they will awake with the same old plight.  
So on Monday morn, 
We'll see a brand new Reform, 
With hangovers in tow, 
Missing their leader and Joe, 
And Canada will surely not mourn.  
UNITED NATIONS BIOSAFETY PROTOCOL 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Why is the government against liability for biotech companies?  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
The second news came to us just this morning. 
These statistics get us thinking. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
The carpet has been rolled out, but it is soiled. 
Does this deserve respect? 
No. After all, mindlessness deserves nothing besides indifference.  
I cannot wait for Quebec to get its loot back.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The current policy is unfair to all those who volunteer their time. 
We urge the minister to reconsider his decision.  
This country needs sound opposition. 
It does not need group therapy sessions for a united alternative.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mentoring is a unique relationship with both professional and personal dimensions. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize Canada's greatest natural resource, our youth.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Parents have been waiting for six years for this government to keep its promise. 
Canada's children deserve the chance to build a better future.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Picture this, Mr. Speaker. 
It is the year 2019. 
Rumours are that the Rolling Stones are breaking up. 
The parliamentary renovations are just winding down.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Look who woke up, Mr. Speaker. 
Canadians are hurting now. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the hon. member can't get no satisfaction. 
I am sorry that in spite of all his efforts he cannot get relief. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from Viagra falls.  
I have a better plan for the government. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member must have already thrown dirt on himself and buried himself. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, here is a guy who really isn't getting any satisfaction.  
We are taking into account the concerns about bracket creep. 
The budget is dealing with that.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the joke is getting as old as that minister.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This is a result of our polices.  
Does this mean they are going to throw him out of their caucus?  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know what change in position the member is referring to.  
The meeting in Halifax went off very well. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Therefore, we have been talking about this issue for a long time.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there are three inaccuracies here. 
Second, Quebec is not adversely affected. 
Third, there is no interference in health. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Both are cheerleaders for privatized two tier health care in this country. 
The Liberals do it through the back door through neglect and inaction. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we categorically oppose two tier medicine.  
We have gone far beyond what the NDP itself has been calling for. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I answered this question for the member last week. 
I will try again and I hope this time she will understand.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
In fact, it is going to pay off past debts. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the federal government is an important funding partner. 
The provinces deliver services. 
They need them but it is up to the provinces to deliver those services.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they are well protected. 
They are in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. 
There are engineers there who are doing an effective job. 
They have just completed renovation on a hospital. 
But they are well protected. 
They are in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
He also tells them not to worry, the French will protect them. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They are in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. 
Different roles are played by troops from different countries. 
The French are doing the protection while the Canadians are doing the engineering work. 
It is a team effort.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
That is a fairly solid guarantee.  
Could I ask the Bloc Quebecois to acknowledge that?  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
That is about what you are going to get in equalization payments''?  
It is very stable and it will increase.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
The answer is relatively simple, Mr. Speaker. 
And all the provinces save Quebec have asked us to.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The best he could do was call the fund remarkable.  
It sure is remarkable. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, no one is in denial on this side. 
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Will he do that?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This project, as with all others, did measure up to those criteria.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Canada is committed to combating this problem. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
That was the purpose of it.  
We clearly said that it would be between 500 and 800 troops. 
That is the parameter of it.  
All hon. members will be so informed.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as I have said, we had the debate the other evening. 
In fact the House leader of the NDP agreed to having that debate that evening. 
It has been done.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
This appears to contradict the Government of Canada's position.  
Will Canada officially support an air strike? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very clear. 
We are still hopeful that before tomorrow there can be an agreement arrived at Rambouillet. 
We are working very hard. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
NATO says today it will have to use force.  
Did the minister change his mind between Wednesday and today, and under whose authority? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is mixing up two matters altogether. 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Why will the foreign affairs minister not stand up for the Canadian mining industry?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again another Reform member just demonstrated how little he really knows.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I thank him for his question.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
It has nothing to do with funding.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This is what it is to be Canadian.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Where is the target? 
Where are the plans?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for a very important question.  
Our debt repayment plan is very simple. 
Third, a contingency reserve of $3 billion. 
The hon. member for Jonquiere. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
They will produce a report by the end of this year.

Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
My constituents have now been waiting 335 days. 
The RCMP gave its response to the government 218 days ago.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like you to consider this. 
Shall all the remaining questions stand?  
CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
He has two minutes remaining for his remarks.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The problems have been articulated. 
The solutions are in front of us. 
Focus on the independent class of immigrants. 
That is very important. 
We have a lot of rights but we do not talk about the responsibilities.  
There are enormous problems faced by immigrants. 
Immigrants go through the hoops. 
That has to end.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Problems were starting to develop and discipline was disappearing. 
I was disappointed that was occurring down there. 
I made application to extend the contract. 
I was checked strongly in that whole area. 
Financial obligations had to be met.  
It is really disgusting. 
I will talk about the early years. 
It was not good for any education system to go in that direction. 
A lot of them did not know because these things were just happening.  
Things just started happening. 
Most of the people said no. 
I asked people ``Why did you let that happen? 
They said that they could not do anything about it. 
That is just the way things are.  
They did not like the bill and did not want it to come into being. 
That was the language law. 
It seemed that the country was operating pretty well before all of that. 
The members of parliament are supposed to be your servants, not your dictators. 
Why do you let it carry on?''  
I can give example after example clear up until the mighty GST. 
Out comes the charter of rights. 
It was not debated to any great extent. 
He declared that, so that is the way it is. 
A government of the people, by the people, for the people. 
The best description of democracy I have ever heard. 
I have yet to see it occur. 
We continually allow those things to happen.  
Then along comes Bill C-63. 
The people stated loud and clear what they would like to see.  
We are the smart ones. 
We have been elected and put in this place. 
We will solve all their problems''. 
I would sit it on the other bank. 
And what do I see here? 
Bills like this one. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member but his time has expired.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I thank the hon. member for that.  
I remind members of the House that I am from an agricultural background. 
Agriculture is very strong in my constituency. 
When I look at the bill it certainly reminds me of that.  
I want one of them to stand and deny this is true.  
They had to put up with it in the countries they came from. 
That is just one aspect of what we have to look at.  
Let us look at the blatant patronage aspect of the bill. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I assure you this does not throw me off topic.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the hon. member rising on a point of order?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the hon. member rising on a point of order?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap.  
Mr. Speaker, I have just heard from an member from the other side. 
This is typical of what goes on and that is fine. 
They do not like it when we raise the idea of patronage appointments.  
What are you talking about?  
That is all they are and nothing more.  
What happened when they did that? 
I want to take on the nationality of a Canadian. 
My children are Canadian and we look upon ourselves as Canadians''. 
Yet the government has threatened them for saying they are Canadian. 
What exactly is going on here? 
It goes beyond being a joke.  
Let us look at some of the powers in clause 43. 
As a Canadian citizen I demand a voice in this regard. 
This is arrogance of the highest form.  
A committee is doing consultation.  
She is not accountable to anyone. 
She has the right to override anything. 
There are dictatorships that wish they had this kind of power. 
The member for Wild Rose was dead on when he said what was happening. 
I would like to end on that note. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the second reading stage of Bill C-63.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed to will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC) moved: 
This was the original intent of the legislation that goes back over 10 years.  
This comes from the government's own officials.  
This included the financial risk. 
This caused a disparity which I referred to. 
Equity and a level standard approach is what is desirable in the final analysis. 
That debate would be for another time.  
The provinces and territories are rightfully upset by the abandonment of the federal government. 
What this would demand is dollars. 
But we know, as a result of the budget, that this will not happen.  
We are not suggesting that this would happen overnight. 
In actual spending this would amount to roughly $240 million. 
It is something I have followed closely. 
This again represents a form of downloading. 
The legislation was not there and it is still not before the Canadian people. 
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
BILL C-49-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Part of this groundwork has included discussions of financial issues.  
What makes the matter worse is that incarceration is extremely expensive. 
That is baloney and you know it.  
You wanted to incarcerate 11-year olds.  
We believe the federal funding should be used to achieve two broad purposes. 
We listened to them and we will follow up on their request.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
We appear to be united on this issue. 
Maybe there is some hope for my hon. colleague yet.  
There is little doubt that there will be additional costs involved. 
Our provinces can only be pushed and downloaded on so far.  
The federal government's bill became too high in the area of corrections. 
So what did it do? 
Costs were downloaded to the provinces. 
I have been actively involved in youth justice issues for a number of years now. 
I have participated in various youth diversion programs. 
It all comes back to proper funding.  
The statistics make it quite clear that young offenders often become adult offenders. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
One would think this is not a big thing to ask for. 
The more invested in crime prevention, the lower the crime rate. 
These are things that lower the country's crime rate. 
We need governments that give priority to prevention.  
We have to remember that. 
That is not the solution. 
We need resources available to prevent children from being in that situation. 
We have to look at that situation very seriously. 
The increase in poverty is certainly a big factor in crime. 
A woman in the Saint John area was badly beaten during a robbery.  
I was speaking with a friend who is a French teacher in Newfoundland. 
We have to look at the causes. 
We did not see any new funding going toward that.  
There is really nothing in the budget to help in this regard. 
This applies to health care too. 
The government found itself in a very difficult situation at one point. 
There was also education, including the post-secondary education I had access to.  
I must say that I was lucky. 
I also had a drug plan, which also covered replacements for eyeglasses. 
I think this is important. 
They are the ones who will be running this country in the future. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
I will come back to these points a bit later.  
The present legislation effectively meets its objectives in Quebec. 
The proof is that we have the lowest rate of juvenile crime in Canada.  
The federal government gradually withdrew, something which is becoming a habit. 
In 1996-97, its share of the funding was down to 36%.  
What works in Quebec should work elsewhere.  
Efforts must focus on what led up to the offence. 
In my opinion, Quebec's approach will pay off.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to Motion No. 508: 
On the face of it, this motion has a great deal to commend itself. 
Let us just keep going back to the old ways of tax and spend. 
Surely justice is as high a priority as any other priority. 
It is open ended. 
It is like the Eveready bunny; it keeps on going and going.  
That priority frankly would be defeated if this motion were to go forward.  
The numbers seem to go on and on.  
With certainty they can plan and budget accordingly. 
The Young Offenders Act speaks to charge, conviction and sentencing. 
In my view, that is the wrong priority. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is truly a pleasure to speak in response to my learned friends. 
The last statement made by my hon. friend opposite spoke of open endedness. 
This is not an open-ended motion. 
This is a motion that would suggest a 50:50 share. 
There is nothing open ended about it.  
I do commend her province for that. 
I agree with that. 
The government is not holding up its end of the bargain.  
More funding does not simply mean more incarceration. 
The provinces have to exercise that discretion, but that was the impression left.  
We are talking about the federal government simply holding up its end of the bargain. 
Provincial and territorial governments are not the inherent enemies of co-ordinated national policy efforts. 
(The House adjourned at 1.43 p.m.)
