EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 66 
Tuesday, February 24, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
APPRENTICESHIP NATIONAL STANDARDS ACT 
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sure you have checked Hansard .  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I will pick up where I left off.  
In 1987 there was a five day dispute between the railways and their union. 
This is a patchwork method of ensuring the continuation of essential services. 
Both management and unions have little incentive to negotiate in good faith. 
Grain farmers will be saying ``Here we go again''.  
We all want to protect against this.  
It is not the only alternative available.  
Back to work legislation undermines the collective bargaining process. 
The arbitrator will then select one of the final offers. 
His offer is binding on both parties. 
What this means is that both sides will be forced to make reasonable offers. 
The entire nature of the collective bargaining process can be improved in the long term. 
They enter into what is commonly referred to as a shotgun agreement. 
How does a shotgun agreement work? 
You have to make a reasonable offer. 
This is similar in a way to final offer selection arbitration. 
It forces both sides in a potential dispute to be reasonable. 
Federal legislation and the Canadian Labour Code affect 700,000 employees. 
We should think about it.  
This is certainly not the way to go about it. 
There is a section in this bill that will allow that. 
We should just think about this for a moment. 
They will not get a secret vote. 
This bill is actually an attack on democracy and I feel very strongly about this. 
It kind of reminds me of another bill.  
Why does it remind me of that bill? 
That is what happened with Bill C-4.  
What did we see? 
We saw them completely flout democracy and it has been denied.  
Obviously with the passage of Bill C-4 he does.  
What we see here is an attack on democracy. 
Certainly I am in agreement with that.  
Mr. Speaker, I see you are indicating, unfortunately. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I find those two positions rather contradictory.  
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to add my comments.  
The audacity of the member opposite knows no bounds. 
It is just incredible. 
It is not that long ago. 
It would not destroy it. 
The hon. member wondered if I would like to comment. 
This is my time. 
It is questions and comments.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member has raised such passions. 
There are so many people who wish to ask questions. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments and his question. 
I hate that term. 
It is very derogatory.  
Ultimately who was hurt? 
It was the workers themselves who were out of work and who lost their jobs.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
When we ran we heard about Bill C-19 on the campaign trail. 
I would urge the member to act on behalf of his constituents.  
Because they say it is better than nothing. 
We have serious concerns about this legislation. 
History will show that is where the disruption takes place. 
It is absolutely ridiculous and she knows it.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
I will therefore be making a 10-minute speech.  
Many bills, including this one, died on the Order Paper as a result.  
But there are also serious deficiencies.  
What are these main deficiencies? 
What is the federal government doing? 
It is in the process of privatizing its public service. 
There are three groups of workers in Quebec. 
Nothing will change for these workers. 
Anti-scab legislation is therefore one way of limiting the length of strikes. 
I was listening to what the Reform member had to say. 
This brings me to another point. 
Why grain and not potatoes? 
Why not other food products considered essential, such as milk? 
So, what has been the result in Quebec City? 
There have been cases of violence. 
The resulting work atmosphere is better as is productivity. 
This should be the aim of the Canada Labour Code. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address this bill. 
Canada and Australia are the only two countries that look in the other direction. 
The member over here called those individuals scabs. 
I do not agree with that. 
I think they are legitimate people trying to earn a decent living. 
They are filling a vacancy- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Levis in response.  
He is absolutely right.  
The Bloc Quebecois is here mainly to defend Quebec's interests. 
The difference is obvious. 
Things are quite different in Quebec. 
When we respect individual rights more, it is in fact a step forward. 
This is not what we are seeing in the western world. 
On the subject of the Quebec charter of rights, he forgot a number of sections. 
He might also have mentioned the United Nations' charter. 
It supports freedoms of expression and of association. 
As individuals, they could never manage it on their own.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
This is the aim.  
I am not alone in saying that. 
Should we bring up the rear? 
The fact is, we are in the forefront.  
In second place in the field of labour relations is British Columbia. 
There is no point in delaying a bill''.  
I have many examples of comments that were faxed to me.  
What is going on is obvious. 
I find the Liberals' misinformation campaign indecent, to say the least. 
There are five or six points in all on which we do not agree. 
Our colleague, the hon. member for Trois-Rivieres, illustrated those points very well yesterday. 
We have a wonderful motto in Quebec. 
Our motto is ``Je me souviens'', I remember. 
We remember the Nationair conflict, when they kept their flights going by using strikebreakers.  
The Liberal government is talking out of both sides of its mouth.  
Not the Bloc Quebecois. 
This is totally unacceptable.  
What do we want first and foremost? 
We want social peace and harmony for Quebec businesses.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
The diversification is now beginning to take place. 
Farmers are beginning to grow products besides the traditional grains. 
One example is that they are going into the cubing of alfalfa, hay. 
They are making these into cubes. 
They should not simply have a few products covered by this. 
It should include all products. 
Farmers do not just grow grains anymore. 
The government should take that to heart. 
My question is should all products not be included?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is another to come. 
We must give the hon. member time to respond.  
I will just respond briefly to the first part of his remarks.  
That is why we say the current system does not work.  
I cannot wait to see that. 
You mean ``We love you, Quebec, when you are on your knees''.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
A 30 second question and a 30 second response.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, you are asking the impossible but I will try.  
It is at arm's length from the minister. 
Mr. Speaker, I do not disagree totally with the hon. member's position. 
She made an interesting comment.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I thank both members for their brevity.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I would have liked to ask a question, but time is running out. 
I would have liked to talk about strike-breakers.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This concerns the official opposition and I hope all opposition parties tremendously. 
This is something we simply cannot allow to happen.  
Perspective jobs that could have come to Canada will simply never be realized.  
There is a higher unemployment rate overall. 
Furthermore this totally undermines the legitimacy of our bargaining units. 
Employee wishes will not be validated in the most basic way. 
Would we believe this was democratic?  
It flies in the face of every tradition we have. 
It is an absolute travesty of democratic principles.  
That is consistent with what happened in other years in Alberta. 
In fact there was 100% employee turnout in 33% of the votes held. 
The average turnout for voting was 70%.  
There is a tremendous privacy issue in the bill. 
It is absolutely shocking. 
If your walk does not match your talk, you have a credibility problem. 
This bill is completely bad.  
This is completely unacceptable.  
There is also the whole idea of replacement workers. 
Where is the balance?  
It will not happen.  
These organizations deal with millions and millions of dollars of workers' money. 
It violates their rights. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
He said: ``I remember''. 
He forgot the latest strike in Canada, the one at Canada Post. 
The Minister of Labour refused to use strikebreakers. 
Now that is an example of leadership by a Canadian minister who listens to workers.  
What we need in this whole area is balance. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We have to argue this point in light of both facts. 
It is unacceptable that scab labour is still allowed. 
We encourage our staff to organize and unionize under an umbrella.  
Mr. Speaker, I wish the hon. member had listened to my remarks. 
A union can operate very democratically. 
The member talked about unreasonable demands being made by employers. 
Unreasonableness is not the sole purview of employers and management. 
It is unfortunate but true that unreasonableness sometimes rests in the bargaining unit, in unions. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
It is a little difficult.  
That is not true. 
That is what they say they want. 
We understand why they want to see everything in black and white. 
That is simply not the case. 
Reformers are union members. 
That is what the report of the government indicated. 
We need to make sure there is not a ban on replacement workers. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I want to speak a little about unions and their roles in Canada. 
Other speakers before me have done a good job of outlining the bill. 
I will start by talking a bit about unions. 
I want to say very clearly that unions serve a very useful role. 
That is an important concern.  
We need better protection for innocent third parties. 
Since 1956 we have had nine major disruptions in the grain industry. 
That was the situation then, although people did not complain about it. 
We certainly had the necessities of life. 
These work stoppages are connected with reality. 
They have an impact on people's lives. 
Section 87.7 of the bill will make a little difference. 
Farmers are trying to diversify. 
Government has encouraged farmers to diversify. 
They can no longer depend on wheat alone. 
The farmers have done a good job in doing that. 
They have started to produce all kinds of alternative crops. 
Now canola rivals wheat in terms of the value of the crop being sold. 
They have done what they thought they should do. 
She quoted from the letter to show that we should be supporting the bill. 
However, part of the quote was really not all that supportive. 
The farmer said this is a good first step. 
We have to go further.  
This is what the Reform Party has been proposing over the last four years. 
They have no place at the negotiation table.  
What we propose is the use of final offer selection arbitration.  
I am going to work through the process. 
The purpose of a strike is to force a settlement. 
It can be used equally by labour and management. 
It is as useful for one side as the other.  
Here is how it works. 
I think that does sound like a far more reasonable solution to the problem. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have a moment to respond to the member. 
He quoted me a number of times on one particular letter I read. 
I could read to him a hundred letters.  
I attended hearings with the Minister of Labour in Vancouver. 
I heard directly from farmers. 
These are the grassroots people, the farmers in his community. 
They are the very people he says he wants to protect.  
I have an excerpt from another letter. 
I urge your support for the bill and in particular section 87.7''.  
As the government we are trying to do that.  
Sometimes we have to walk before we run. 
We believe this is a good bill.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
That is exactly what I was talking about.  
As I was growing up, these were my friends and neighbours. 
That is what this legislation will in no way deliver. 
It has to move right from the elevator system to the coast first. 
That is more often than not where there is a problem. 
That is what we want to do and that is what we are calling for. 
The letters are important, but let us interpret them accurately.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for Lakeland on his presentation.  
I have two questions for the member. 
I have a question on work stoppage at ports. 
The board has the power to determine the question of seniority. 
I would like to know the member's comments on this section.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
I certainly encourage him to repeat it later.  
As the member indicated, we would like it to go an awful lot further. 
We think that is extremely important.  
It will be all of one or all of the other. 
Whichever one is chosen, I think both parties will be relatively happy.  
We certainly encourage that type of mechanism. 
It goes much further. 
It will not only deal with grain because I do not think it is fair. 
My heart is with grain farmers. 
I grew up in that type of setting. 
My neighbours and friends were and still are grain farmers. 
The legislation discriminates unfairly in that regard as well.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
We see a lot of union bosses sitting in the NDP ranks.  
It does not believe in democratic choice. 
Why is the NDP against the worker? 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question. 
He believed in democracy.  
Democracy has been taken out of the union movement. 
Part of what is not in the legislation is fairness in voting. 
That is why many union members are voting Reform. 
That movement will continue and expand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The proposed system would allow and even condone such a situation. 
I find it unacceptable.  
This will change the rules of the game. 
There are other aspects that do not seem acceptable to us. 
This is another important point.  
I will raise one last point, which seems very significant to me. 
This reflects a lack of co-operation we might have expected. 
The minister did not go along with this position. 
This is not a government in its first few months in office. 
Clearly, the government has listened to some lobby groups. 
This is the downside of how our political parties are funded. 
It is an example Canada should have followed.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
They can also release the list of employees working off site without their consent. 
I will come back to the other areas in a moment. 
Unfortunately that is not happening very well now. 
I am thinking of grain farmers in particular. 
That is one area I know very well. 
In 1987 there was a work stoppage between the railways and their union. 
Five days were lost. 
There were heavy financial losses. 
These are not just figures on paper. 
This simply is not good enough. 
In fact we never make up for that.  
From a trade perspective it is hurting our credibility.  
It has cost us very heavily.  
That is a good provision but it is a half-baked measure.  
It simply does not go far enough. 
It is a red herring. 
There is a major change which the Liberals are proposing. 
That is fundamentally wrong. 
That does not sound right to me. 
It is a fundamental principle of democracy.  
It does not deal with final offer arbitration. 
However at that point there must be a more enlightened process. 
In the end that is what is happening anyway. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
I wonder what the purpose of this labour code reform really is. 
Just remember the sad episode at Ogilvie's. 
Of course, the minister says he will consult. 
Bill C-19 is nothing more than a lot of razzle-dazzle. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Regrettably the revised version contains the same defects its predecessor displayed. 
Bill C-66 was from the last Parliament.  
I would like to outline a couple of those. 
Imagine if we ran federal or provincial elections that way. 
The NDP members should be outraged. 
Tommy Douglas represented my riding back in the mid-1960s. 
He actually got 52.4% of the vote.  
There is really no need to rush this through. 
It has been 25 years since this labour code has been revised. 
There really is no need to rush through these sorts of provisions.  
I quote one of the objections listed in this letter: 
Frankly, no union should ever be certified without a secret ballot. 
The workers had voted 151-43 against union representation.  
It is absolutely outrageous. 
It violates the fundamentals of freedom of voting in society. 
It is an absolutely ludicrous provision.  
I will now leave it for my colleagues to take up the charge.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
The Quebec charter of rights and freedoms provides the following basic rights. 
The Quebec charter of rights and freedoms provides these rights: 
No one may in a judicial act stipulate a clause involving discrimination. 
Such a clause is deemed without effect.  
It appears the Liberals like these particular types of boards. 
In this case the board is a quasi-judicial body. 
It is not unlike other quasi-judicial bodies the Liberal government likes setting up.  
The board will be the final arbitrator or the final decision maker. 
That is a travesty of justice.  
They will be making decisions on certification, for instance. 
Again the employer will have very little to say about it. 
That again goes far beyond the mandate any board should be given. 
I have seen some of the actions within unions when things heat up. 
They are possibly jeopardizing the security and safety of the individuals or their families. 
I do not think that is appropriate at all. 
If something did in fact happen, who will advocate on behalf of off site workers? 
I do not know of anyone.  
I point my finger at the Liberal government. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
You ask, Mr. Speaker, by whose consent this is done. 
This is all at the wish of the Canadian Industrial Relations Board. 
I would like to delve right into this if I might. 
What are they really doing? 
What is the whole purpose behind it? 
They make them less accountable. 
This is a great example. 
Two unions tried to claim majority support by cards. 
That is a clear demonstration of why the card based system does not work. 
That is one fundamental flaw with the card based system.  
How is that democratic? 
It fails so many fundamental tests of what this law should pass. 
It does not make any sense to give these types of powers. 
You can quote me on this one and I hope others do. 
This case is just like the Canada Wheat Board case. 
It is asking for powers that it will use and abuse. 
Those MPs will have to justify it.  
It will be done against their wishes.  
They have referred to the grain handling situation. 
There is no sequestering of assets. 
Once again the Liberal government has failed. 
It has failed because this is not an appropriate guarantee. 
It is a misrepresentation. 
It is pulling the wool over the eyes of Canadian farmers.  
There is little or no provision for ensuring they do not. 
The grain can still be held up.  
Shame on the Liberal government. 
There are some other things in the bill which really get my goat. 
One is the fact that the definitions are so vague. 
This will give significant powers to the Canada industrial relations board.  
They have not looked at the fine print. 
Sixty-two per cent of all Albertans are in favour of that concept.  
It no longer represents the workers.  
This bill does not provide for secret ballots for union elections. 
The bill is flawed. 
It has to be reviewed. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
I understand that government members are arguing that it will not work. 
I will offer suggestions to them as to why it will work. 
It will save this country billions of dollars every year. 
I would ask them to listen carefully. 
They have probably heard about this in the House before. 
I am talking about final offer selection arbitration.  
I practised labour law. 
For five years I was involved in the negotiating process.  
One of the two must be picked.  
Final offer selection arbitration does not hamper the negotiating process. 
In fact it helps it. 
The parties know what will happen if they do not reach a negotiated settlement. 
Let me give an analogy of how well this works. 
The civil courts in British Columbia have somewhat of a similar system. 
The principle is the same on how it works. 
By doing that they come very close together and quite often they settle. 
Exactly the same principle would work here in final offer selection arbitration.  
I would ask the government members to listen to this. 
Therefore, the parties would come together and it would be a better situation. 
It is such a simple system and would offer so much to our economy. 
Our economy is growing and it would grow that much quicker. 
The lost opportunity is in the billions of dollars.  
I would ask members of the government to revisit this bill. 
It is beyond me why this government is addressing all these issues. 
It will be nice to find out what it is really up to.  
Again, this is to offer a constructive alternative. 
I emphasize that this is not just about money. 
I ask the government to take a look at this.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
This bill was introduced in the last Parliament. 
I share some of the concerns. 
That does not make any sense at all.  
Secret ballots are important as well. 
Those are two of the major concerns I have. 
I am sure the parliamentary secretary will be addressing those concerns.  
It is we versus them. 
This adversarial component is further entrenched in the legislation. 
That is not a healthy situation. 
As the member points out, the negotiations continue to take place. 
That is very important. 
Both sides will negotiate. 
That would require, as the hon. member points out, both sides to be reasonable. 
They have to be reasonable in their positions. 
What is requires them to do is put forward a package.  
We are dealing with a very small percentage of the labour force. 
This code applies only to federally regulated industries. 
It does not apply to provincially regulated industries. 
It is in the public interest. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I like that in the legislation.  
Right at the top of my list is the privacy issue. 
But that has not encouraged this government to back off. 
We know where you live. 
This is not the way things are supposed to operate in Canada.  
Filling out cards will be regarded as ample. 
They get enough cards signed, they are certified. 
No vote, no problem. 
This is not the way unions are supposed to be run. 
In fact, it entrenches it even more deeply than it is now. 
It could have had provision in this bill for final offer selection arbitration. 
If they reach an impasse, each one puts down their final offer. 
It is the civilized way of doing business. 
They do not have to hit the bricks. 
This is the wave of the future in labour relations. 
I think it is coming. 
It is an idea that in due course will take over labour-management relations. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
I do not know how much it costs in the bureaucracy to do that. 
We can accept that. 
It is a nice way for them to make a few extra bucks.  
That type of legislation is more than scary. 
I had a restaurant at one time that was unionized. 
It operated very successfully. 
When I look at a majority overruling the minority, it scares me.  
This clause absolutely astounds me.  
To vote in privacy is a privilege and a right we all have. 
I cannot help but relate the bill to other issues. 
As the immigration critic for my party I asked the minister many questions. 
The government eventually proved that. 
It admitted that he got here and should not have got here. 
He has a big house in Vancouver. 
His family is living there. 
He got into Canada illegally. 
He is a criminal''. 
This man was in our country illegally. 
He was a crook. 
Where is their privacy? 
We should be ashamed this clause is even in the bill.  
I said ``What about deporting those people?'' 
What kind of rights do those Canadian citizens have? 
What kind of rights do landed immigrants have? 
The next thing we will do is demand that everything be made public. 
Our names will be published no matter what we do. 
We will all go nuts, but the mail will get through.  
That is my right. 
I do not understand why government members are not speaking. 
We use the Privacy Act to protect crooks and thieves.  
The article is by Tom Godfrey of the Toronto Sun . 
Police stepped up the search yesterday, releasing a mug-shot of the fugitive.  
He was convicted but released on probation.  
Yet what does this bill say? 
It is not their right. 
Even as a member of Parliament we can use our constituency office as an address. 
We do not have to use our home address. 
A lot of members do but it is their right and freedom to do so. 
In this situation they are taking away the rights of all Canadians with this legislation.  
In conclusion, I know there will be amendments so I will speak later.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Some eloquent speeches were made this morning. 
I went to a door that was answered by a young person. 
We started talking about the upcoming election. 
I asked him whether he would be voting this time. 
I really want to vote''.  
We got talking about what the various parties represented. 
That young person was aware and thrilled about the ability of being able to vote. 
He was on fire because he wanted to get involved in the election. 
That right to vote is being denied in this legislation to the workers of Canada.  
That is what this legislation is all about.  
It is an indictment of a government that proposes this kind of legislation.  
It goes beyond simply denying a vote. 
Is this not absolutely amazing?  
It is hard to imagine how anyone would dare to do such a thing.  
Then it goes into substituting a card for a ballot. 
That is the kind of situation we are in at this point.  
There is a complete contradiction of principles here.  
This list of names is now obligatory. 
For what purpose will that list of names be used? 
To send out information? 
To appeal to me to become a member of this particular group? 
To be bombarded with unsolicited mail from people we do not want to hear from? 
We have no way of knowing how this list of names will be used.  
That is what it shall be used for.  
However, there is no guarantee that the list will be used like that. 
It may be used for other purposes. 
The access has now been given to private information. 
The potential for abuse and misuse is severe.  
Let us look at another provision in this act which relates to the same thing. 
The first one is: 
That information should be private and it should be confidential. 
The bill fails on that point.  
Another area has to do with the replacement workers. 
Is that not a very interesting interpretation of this clause.  
It is totally irresponsible and ridiculous to make a claim like that. 
That is what has been done here. 
That is an absolutely irresponsible clause. 
I will discuss the accountability of the proposed board. 
Guess what the annual report contains. 
It will tell the minister how many members there were over various years. 
There is absolutely no accountability whatsoever. 
It does nothing of the kind. 
We take very strong exception to this.  
I want to end on a positive note. 
We want harmony between employers and employees. 
This will make us a competitive nation. 
It will build our businesses and employ our young people. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
The government pretends it does not see it in this bill.  
As the minister deems necessary. 
Let us see what the political decision is.  
Twenty people are brought in from the government to tip the balance. 
The unions supported me in the June 2 election. 
They can never go on strike. 
We take away the right to strike from the largest union in my constituency. 
And we say that the bill is designed for modernization?  
My colleague you still have a little time left. 
You will have the floor if you so want it after question period.  
It being almost 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
ELI AND LAURETTA MARTIN 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
In addition both have done extensive volunteer work in their community. 
We wish them many more years of happiness together.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have just come from the Reform youth convention. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
The New Brunswick flag is modelled on our coat of arms adopted in 1868. 
The hon. member for North Vancouver.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
He was taken to a local clinic and then to Credit Valley hospital. 
The money will be used for research at Mount Sinai hospital.  
Let us all help put an end to this tragic disease.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
He said he would resign if a Senate election were called.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Andre Nadeau was a first-time contender in this race. 
Thirty-eight 14-dog teams started the race. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us remember all our heros. 
Our athletes went to Japan to fulfil their Olympic dream.  
We are all proud of her.  
FORMER BC MINE WORKERS 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
What has become of the people who loved Quebec so much in October 1995?  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, let us pass out the pom-poms and tutus to the Reform Party. 
In Canada poor people can get medical treatment. 
We need to scrap the MAI which would kill our health care system. 
Support money for medicare and nix the MAI.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
This opening-up has meant many benefits for Canada and the Canadian economy. 
It has helped create jobs since 1995.  
The member for Compton-Stanstead.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
I avidly followed the Olympic Games. 
``I congratulate you on the medals you so deservedly won. 
You are finally reaping the reward of years of efforts. 
``I thank you, Annie, for so ably representing our country. 
``You, Annie, are one great Canadian''.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Millions of Canadians share this youngster's anguish. 
Canada is a land of immigrants. 
It is by definition a multicultural society rich in diversity and tolerance. 
Listen to the people and let Canadians be Canadians.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
When we reach that time''- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is very clear.  
When we have a surplus we will have about a billion dollars. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this has a familiar ring to it. 
He is qualifying, adding, subtracting.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That is because the surplus was given to them alone. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would rather have people well trained than not trained at all. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He knows it and the Canadian public knows it. 
Taxpayers are owed that surplus now but they are not going to get it. 
When is it going to be?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I understand that and we are trying to be as nice as possible. 
We will train them.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this takes some nerve. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I hope they will tell students.  
At this time, we are in the enviable position of being able to help students. 
The hon. member for Quebec.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is not a gift, it is paid for by our tax dollars.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
So I think we will keep up the good work.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
What business does the federal government have interfering?  
There is therefore nothing new in this.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
New Brunswickers have already paid for this road through their taxes. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are greatly concerned by the poverty of families and children in Canada. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The second point is yes, we are very preoccupied with jobs. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
That usually means another hard working young person is out of a job.  
When will the government wake up and smell the coffee?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know that payroll taxes have been reduced. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
I have a very simple question for the Prime Minister:
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They had a single goal: to destroy the finance minister's credibility. 
They did not and will not succeed.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They cannot attack the Minister of Finance on what he has done. 
They are trying to destroy the Minister of Finance.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Thank you for dictating to me how I must spend my money. 
Thank you for making my old age like living in hell.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be perfectly clear. 
The government need not take any lessons from the Reform Party on taxes.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Having said that, I want to ask the hon. member a question. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to forgive the minister. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the finance minister.  
Kyle is from my riding. 
He is 21 years old, currently unemployed. 
How can Kyle afford to live, let alone pay down his student loan? 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Let me say this, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is in fact what he will do. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
If the opposition already has the answer, they are most fortunate. 
I believe that the nature of the figures has not been clarified. 
There are other elements, and I want to understand them before I reach a decision.  
UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We believe that Canada has an opportunity to make a major contribution.  
I hope all the leaders will make sure that is endorsed.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
That debt was increased by $100 billion by this government opposite. 
Let us never forget that.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Surely the opposition can wait two more hours. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
These are the people who balanced the budget, not the Liberals. 
They are the ones who will pay off the Liberal-Tory mortgage. 
Canadians deserve a break.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have no lessons to take from the Reform Party. 
We will continue on our track.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
However, DFO documents clearly state otherwise.  
The hon. parliamentary secretary.  
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Agriculture and Agri-Food)(Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is referring to a specific case. 
I will have to obtain the necessary information before I can respond. 
I will be pleased to provide him with an answer next time.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I have met with a number of local organizations. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Second, yes, there will be public consultations. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Let us face it. 
Will the Prime Minister give a millennium tax- 
The hon. parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of agriculture.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can certainly clarify it very easily.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Will he make that information public?  
Mr. Speaker, here are the results of a December 8, 1997 Angus Reid poll.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I am working on it. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not have the budget documents yet. 
I will have them in one hour and 37 minutes.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
I must say that the federal legislation is clear: no means no.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I ask that the minister table that poll in this House.  
The hon. minister has a document with him it seems. 
The page will pick it up and it will be tabled in the House.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
My colleague, there are two parts to putting forth a motion. 
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to put forth a motion?  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The hon. member's point is well taken. 
I will go over a bit, but not too much. 
They averaged 42 seconds.  
I am going to have to be like the referee in a hockey game. 
I am the only one who can bring in a whistle, which means a clock.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
We would go from there.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that the matter has been clarified. 
It is important that the Speaker clarify this.  
That is not in keeping with the intent of that rule.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I, like you, am bound by the rules. 
The House can take care of itself, I believe. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
In Saskatchewan we can have blizzards at any time. 
Many times we have blizzards without even the weather forecast coming in. 
We do not need government interference. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I echo those concerns.  
This board will not be accountable to anybody. 
Somebody will be replacing Ted Weatherill. 
Hopefully he will show greater leadership.  
It is a very dangerous practice which the government continues to carry on.  
It goes in the wrong direction.  
That is arrogance at the very worst.  
I do not think Canadians appreciate that direction from the government. 
The government does not support the democratic principle of the majority making decisions. 
What else will we see from the government? 
What do we have in this piece of legislation? 
We have a situation where an individual can belong to a company. 
That takes jobs out of this country.  
I suggest it should do it tomorrow rather than leave it any longer.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
There are companies and unions in my constituency. 
The Canada Industrial Relations Board should not be allowed to do this. 
Clause 50 should be repealed.  
We have an issue in Canada of privacy of information. 
The invasion of the privacy of the workers in my constituency is absolutely unacceptable.  
The statement of Professor Paul Weiler of Harvard University is compelling. 
However we are talking about the entire country of Canada. 
We are talking about a very large workforce. 
Again, nobody is without fault. 
Knives have a tendency to cut going in both directions. 
But what is the remedy proposed?  
This kind of law is very dangerous.  
The Reform Party supports the concept of final offer selection arbitration. 
This is a preferred method of binding arbitration.  
It would be good for the companies. 
The most important thing is it would be good for Canada.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I have had a varied work experience in my short lifetime. 
There are pluses on both sides.  
I came out at the end without a debt. 
I had only my taxes to pay when I got my first job. 
I gladly pay them, to a limit.  
I worked in a non-union shop. 
We were paid by the hour at the going rate. 
Some of the others in our shop were paid more. 
I tried very hard. 
As a result I ingratiated myself to the boss.  
As a result I got priority over some of the others.  
If that were a union shop there would have been trouble. 
Our business did well. 
I say our business because I felt a part of it. 
I was a good contributing member of the business. 
The union was not there to help me at all. 
That does not provide for high motivation.  
I am not anti-union. 
We were forced members of the union. 
I think other people would feel just as bad. 
The point I am making is that we need to have more individual freedom. 
It was run by the Government of Alberta. 
It was before the union there was a forced issue. 
We did not have a union when I first started there. 
One year the institute had trouble getting instructors. 
That is I suppose how I got there. 
I was just wondering whether anyone was listening. 
It had trouble getting qualified instructors. 
Later on we had a union. 
The same issue came up. 
It would not just open the money clauses. 
To me that is so totally absurd. 
It is a total infringement of individual freedoms.  
I am going to give the other side as well. 
I have also seen situations where individuals have not been fairly treated. 
So we supported each other that way. 
There is some merit in that.  
Do not read into it that I am anti-union. 
What I want to do is make unions more democratic.  
In this bill we have before us today unions are strengthened. 
To me that is upsetting a balance. 
I have been involved in a number of cases where we have had contract disputes. 
I do not want the right to be without a job and without an income. 
What I want is a fair income. 
What I want is to be treated fairly''. 
That is what they really want.  
Their primary purpose is to achieve their monetary and job security goals.  
I have enjoyed the hon. member's remarks but his time has expired.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I too have enjoyed his remarks. 
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
It has a city with manufacturing and service industries. 
There is some concern with this bill and some of its the flaws. 
The unfair balance of it has been pointed out to me by constituents and others. 
I will address my comments to them.  
He immediately turned and left. 
But I am sure that was not my friend from Elk Island.  
In order to meet our commitments we have to deliver in a timely fashion.  
Some of those aspects are missing in this bill. 
The government should have another look at that and address some of those issues.  
They are concerned with what that means. 
Does it mean grain or does it mean other products? 
That just will not work.  
We see trade missions going all over the world. 
It is wrong to take $500 million out of the economy of this country. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
This government has a particularly bad record for listening to the people. 
Thousands of people from all over Alberta were in our riding. 
It went extremely well. 
Everybody is upset about what happens in the Senate. 
Everybody talked about that. 
Third, they talked about taxes. 
What is this government- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think it is really, really important that we do.  
Certainly the parliamentary secretary is correct. 
After all, that is what he said he would speak about. 
We are talking about listening to the people. 
That is what people are talking about. 
They are not talking about more spending.  
That is not democratic. 
We have examples now of where the government will do this sort of thing.  
Again they do not have to ask the employees about that. 
They do not have to get permission. 
This is an intrusion on a person's rights as a citizen of Canada.  
This legislation does nothing to stop strikes. 
This again will be more of the same. 
They were shocked by this. 
That comes from the union, from the top down. 
The union members are pretty upset about that and I do not blame them. 
That is a lack of democracy. 
What about the world? 
Where are we at in terms of the world? 
Obviously in the world, we are in competition. 
I have been fortunate for 35 years to travel the world. 
I have been to almost every country. 
Is it still in the marketplace?'' 
Bill C-19 does nothing to help provide a fix for that problem. 
That is what the farmers are saying.  
The bill does not address the area of investment. 
They do not know for sure how stable our labour force will be. 
They have real problems with that. 
What is the solution? 
It seems to me that the solution is to get back to the grassroots. 
We must listen to the employees. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Nanaimo-Alberni stretches right across the centre of Vancouver Island. 
We have fisheries, we have forestry and we have retirement. 
It is a town with heart. 
It is a town which has grown through the labour movement. 
It used to be a strong NDP community. 
Now it is a strong Reform community.  
My background is that of a professional forester. 
I worked in the forest industry for 25 years. 
Frankly, it is nuts. 
I can see that members opposite are agreeing with me.  
It seems to fit into the Liberal idea of what democracy is. 
Unfortunately that does not work in the rest of Canada.  
There are strong unions within Ontario. 
The auto workers come to mind.  
They are clearly in a dilemma. 
I point out that labour unions are well paid people.  
It is the taxpaying public. 
You should hear them muttering over there, Mr. Speaker. 
It is about investment. 
Investment in B.C. requires a solid base. 
It is now having great difficulty getting foreign investment.  
However, the Senate does have its purpose. 
It killed this bill. 
It killed it for a reason. 
The reason was it did not work. 
So the new bill came in, and what have we got? 
Very much of the same type of legislation. 
It is a gloss over of the old type of legislation. 
This government has to realize that it has to listen up. 
Even the Senate cannot take this type of legislation. 
But it is going to try it again, to keep pushing. 
This government has tried it on a number of types of legislation. 
Look at endangered species last time in the last Parliament. 
It did not go through. 
Members on the government side could not vote for it. 
Look at the conference on global warming in Kyoto. 
This is typical of this bill. 
Government has not done its homework. 
When other countries get together, where is Canada? 
We do not have our act together. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
I think the hon. member for York South-Weston knows that.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for York South-Weston does make a good point. 
In the last little while the speakers have all been from the Reform Party. 
I am sorry for making that impression.  
I will add my name to the list with my little story.  
I also spent an equivalent amount of time in management with the same union. 
I know what it is like to work with a unionized crew. 
All my crews were unionized.  
The word balance is important. 
I cannot support that portion of the bill.  
There is also the huge issue of what we call remedial certification. 
They are unionized whether 10% wanted it or 15% or 39% or 49%. 
It is a done deal.  
This tips it in my opinion to the wrong side.  
There are some improvements from times past. 
They send a significant amount of money to unions. 
Unions use that money in the ways they see fit to promote their union organizations. 
Was the money spent to promote another union? 
Maybe that would be something they would approve of. 
Was it spent to support a political party? 
However it has been used to try to defeat certain candidates and to elect others. 
In general there is a need for balance in the legislation. 
The balance between union rights is very important. 
It is too bad that privacy rights are not being looked after. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
I worked in logging. 
Safety is a major concern in that industry. 
It is one of the most dangerous occupations one would ever want to encounter. 
There are some specific jobs that are very demanding and hazardous. 
The union certainly has a very large role to play in terms of safety. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We have a debate under way here and hon. members would like to hear it.  
I appreciate the circumstances.  
I like to think I worked in some very good workplaces.  
We have to think about what the legislation is all about. 
Whose interest is at stake here? 
There has to be a better way. 
Will the bill create harmonious relationships? 
There is nothing in the bill that deals with anything of the kind.  
What do we have here? 
We have one significant change. 
We agree that a 10 year appointment is too long. 
An appointment is probably inappropriate but the timeframe was certainly wrong. 
Ten years have been brought down to five. 
The labour relations board will have some basic powers. 
It is a quasi-judicial board. 
It is a board with a lot of power. 
There will be three members from management and three members from union. 
We know who appoints them. 
Do we know how much power they have? 
Another point concerns me. 
It has to do with the interpretation of representation. 
We know that is also left to labour.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib) moved: 
That this House approve in general the budgetary policy of the government.  
The details of the measures are contained in the documents. 
Their hard work has been invaluable.  
This is the first budget of a new mandate. 
Canadians have always known that securing these goals would not be easy. 
Canadians understood that fundamental problems require fundamental change. 
In 1994 that plan was put in place. 
This budget marks a further stage in that plan. 
It makes it very clear that our resolve will not weaken.  
When we came into office, the country's economy was in disarray.  
The turnaround today is very evident.  
Job creation is accelerating. 
Consumer confidence has rebounded. 
The economic recovery is now supported by strong domestic demand.  
Business confidence is at record levels. 
We live in a volatile world. 
Clearly the events in Asia will have an impact. 
Furthermore, economic growth is helping to push the deficit down dramatically. 
We will balance the budget next year. 
We will balance the budget the year after that. 
We will balance the budget this fiscal year.  
We are at a turning point in our history.  
This achievement is the accomplishment of Canadians, not of government. 
It is clear that a new era lies ahead. 
We will be frugal. 
Never again will we allow the spectre of overspending to haunt this land. 
Canadians have paid to see the movie ``The Deficit''. 
They do not want to pay again to see the sequel.  
Second, we will be focused in everything we do. 
The core priority of government must be to set the national agenda. 
Third, we will be steadfast. 
The challenges facing the country are deeply rooted. 
They are not the stuff of quick fixes. 
Fourth, we must work in partnership. 
Acting alone, in isolation, is no longer on. 
But we must work together.  
Fifth, we must be balanced and we must be fair. 
Canada is not just a marketplace. 
It is a community. 
That is the spirit that built this land.  
It was there again when the Red River struck. 
It is there in every community. 
That is why this budget provides resources for the national AIDS strategy. 
This is the single largest expenditure accounted for in this budget. 
Canada has now established a reputation as a low inflation country. 
It is a reputation and a reality we will protect.  
Next, let me turn to the issue of the debt. 
We have won a major battle. 
We have not yet won the war. 
The lower the ratio, the more manageable the debt.  
It will be brought down through the implementation of a two-track strategy.  
Second, we will bring down the absolute level of debt itself.  
This is our debt repayment plan. 
We will continue to be consistently more cautious than our private sector forecasters. 
Indeed, that process is already under way.  
There are two principal ways to calculate the deficit.  
It includes all the liabilities the government incurs over the course of a year.  
For some the race is virtually won before it is begun. 
For many others it clearly is not. 
Circumstance and privilege can create a playing field which is very uneven. 
A rising economic tide does not lift all boats. 
For 200 years in Canada prosperity and knowledge have gone hand in hand. 
However, let us understand the true nature of the dynamic that is at play. 
As a society we are not educated because we are prosperous. 
We are prosperous because we have extended the frontiers of education. 
Learning must be the central part of any national jobs strategy.  
The facts speak for themselves.  
However, for those with degrees or diplomas, 450,000 jobs were gained.  
However, this is by no means only about university. 
The backbone of a country is the strength of its middle class.  
Too many are deterred from pursuing higher education because of a fear of large debt. 
Now, before proceeding further, let me be very clear on one point.  
Education is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. 
Today we are taking action in response to that consensus and that request.  
Action is required on seven fronts.  
Fourth, assisting families to save for their children's education.  
Sixth, helping young people make the transition from school to work.  
In this budget the Prime Minister's commitment and vision become reality.  
The scholarships will average $3,000 each per year. 
We also believe that Canadians should get to know their country better.  
The Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation will be a private, independent body. 
We will ensure that a student is on the board.  
Graduates must deal with it.  
These changes will benefit up to 100,000 graduates in financial hardship.  
Finally, for most, these measures will be sufficient. 
Today we are announcing two additional steps to support part time studies. 
Up until now this has been available only to full time students. 
This will assist 250,000 students who could not take advantage of this credit before.  
There is more to be done. 
Today we are moving forward to help meet this challenge.  
Providing opportunity to improve skills is an important way to make sure that happens.  
But we must look ahead to the students of tomorrow.  
Today, Canadians are already saving for their children in many ways. 
Some set up special bank accounts. 
Many simply set aside a bit of money whenever they can. 
Today we are taking a significant further step.  
Today marks the beginning of a new partnership with parents. 
They speak to the partnership of generations.  
As we brought the deficit down, many difficult choices were made. 
One of these was a reduction in funding for the granting councils.

The youth unemployment problem remains grave in this country. 
However, much more remains to be done. 
Many more employers must rise to the challenge if it is to be overcome.  
Having access to a computer puts the world literally at one's fingertips. 
That is their right. 
It is our duty and it is a responsibility that we are acting upon today.  
But let us be very clear. 
The capacity to learn does not begin in school. 
Details of these improvements will be announced after discussions with the provinces.  
The CPP is about our values as a nation. 
It is about the sharing of risk and the security of benefits.  
Our tax policy is crystal clear.  
First, our financial resources are limited. 
Third, the tax system must be fair. 
In this budget, the process of targeted assistance is being continued.  
The support they provide is irreplaceable.  
This will increase or extend assistance to well over 400,000 caregivers. 
They give concrete meaning to the concept of good citizenship. 
As a result, 400,000 people will be removed from the tax rolls completely.  
The deficit went up. 
The surtax remained on.  
Today we are announcing the elimination of the deficit. 
Today, we are announcing the elimination of the deficit. 
These tax measures are a first step. 
Looking ahead, we will build upon them as we can. 
We will do so in a measured and responsible way. 
First, in previous budgets, we reduced the deficit. 
In future budgets, we will stay the course.  
Today we cannot pretend that our task is over. 
We dare not coast now. 
We cannot let go.  
Well, there is a new destiny we must design for ourselves.  
They hold us together. 
They equip the country to succeed, and succeed we will.  
It is about meeting the diverse needs of a modern nation. 
It is about managing the present while at the same time preparing for the future. 
That frames our challenge.  
Our responsibility as we go forward is very clear. 
It is to turn opportunity for some into opportunity for all.  
That is what this budget seeks. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Sad to say, this budget does not provide that reward.  
Spending is up by $11 billion over the next four years. 
The taxpayers are going to notice.  
That the debate be now adjourned.  
(The House adjourned at 6.01 p.m.)
