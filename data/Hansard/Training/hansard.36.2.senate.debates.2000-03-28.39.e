The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
Comments by Leader of the Government During Debate 
However, this is not accurate. 
I have been in public life for nearly 30 years. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, "Show me a hero and I will write you a tragedy." 
Parliamentary Vision for International Cooperation at the Dawn of the Third Millennium 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Visit to Israel by Pope John Paul II 
Whatever else he has done, he has endeared himself to the Jewish people.  
Thirty-fifth Anniversary of Provincial Flag 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
The galley is the conventional heraldic representation of a ship. 
Hence, the oars were removed while the flag was dedicated.  
Am I not correct, Senator Robichaud?  
Hon. Louis J. Robichaud :
May it fly in glory for many years to come.  
State of Domestic and International Financial System 
Interim Report of Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee on Study Tabled 
Hon. E. Leo Kolber :
The report is entitled, "Export Development Act." 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Payments in Lieu of Taxes Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on March 30, 2000, I will move: 
Report on Restructuring Reserves-Viability of Militia 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Could the minister explain the process for restructure? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In fact, he has done so specifically with respect to one particular unit.  
The honourable leader will have to answer that one today!  
I passed that information along to the Minister of National Defence.  
I have also had the occasion recently to meet Mr. Fraser. 
He is a man of great integrity and ability.  
The department has managed to upset service personnel in some 41 of the 139 units. 
I do not see any justification for that whatsoever. 
Perhaps there is an explanation. 
I am sure the militia units concerned would love to have one.  
I will attempt to respond to the honourable senator with due dispatch.  
Cape Breton-Future of New Reserve Facility 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a final question. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That gives me a level of confidence as we speak about the topic. 
It is a brand new facility and quite an impressive one. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
If it were a mathematical question, the Supreme Court could do it. 
Deloitte & Touche could do it. 
Any number of institutions could do it. 
If the judgment were capable of being made in advance, then one might do that. 
The Supreme Court sets out those two points clearly. 
Honourable senators, I apologize if I took the leader by surprise. 
I do not disagree with that; it is entirely logical.  
The first two criteria are strictly mathematical. 
The size of the majority is a simple mathematical number. 
The percentage of eligible voters is another mathematical calculation. 
It is a number and is not subjective. 
Here is the legislation."  
I am asking whether the government feels itself somewhat bound by that precedent?  
One example comes to mind. 
It still stands on the same 50 per cent plus 1. 
With the same mathematical figure, the surrounding circumstances might call for a different interpretation.  
Some of those factors are pointed out very specifically in the legislation.  
Possibility of Lowering Threshold for Cities to Achieve Metropolitan Status 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The benefits to cities of metropolitan status are important. 
That is my first question.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for raising that interesting point. 
I want to be sure I understand it so I can properly convey the issue. 
What is the disadvantage? 
Invariably they look to cities identified by Stats Canada as metropolitan areas. 
If we use that as an example, many places would be totally overlooked. 
We have had that experience in the City of Moncton. 
It is detrimental for cities that fall just short of that number. 
Honourable senators, the honourable senator raises an interesting point. 
I will pursue the matter with the minister responsible.  
They got their share over the years.  
I understand and appreciate that fact. 
However, the international scene is very difficult. 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator suggests a particular form that a referendum question may take. 
I would not dare guess what format or what approach the Parti Quebecois might adopt. 
They will not give clarity a high priority.  
I imagine that will be a matter of personal judgment.  
Honourable senators, I do not understand the minister's reply. 
This does not make sense!  
Honourable senators, it would not be illegal. 
I do not know the answer. 
The bill does not speak to that specifically. 
This will be a non-event.  
This is what that parliamentarian will have to decide. 
How could a federal politician then take part in such a campaign? 
This is completely illogical.  
Honourable senators, the honourable senator may be right. 
The Prime Minister or a minister may decide not to participate. 
The Government of Quebec can pose a question that asks any number of things.  
I do not know at this stage. 
The bill does not address that issue, nor should it. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a supplementary to that question. 
So nothing is resolved.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Provisions of Naval Service Act 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck on February 24, 2000) 
Long-Term Benefits to Taxpayers 
( Response to questions raised by Hon. David Tkachuk on March 1, 2000 ) 
What exactly is the Web site illustrating? 
Why doesn't it include increases in CPP contributions?  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
It never has been, and I do not suppose it ever will be. 
Politics is a constant battle which costs money - usually a fair bit of it. 
Like the Pacific scandal, it too involved political contributions. 
Provincially, it is another story. 
Helmut Kohl is a perfect example. 
In Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Barak is in a similar situation. 
For the wherewithal to fill party election chests, for the sinews of war.  
In fact, I would argue they are getting stronger. 
Thankfully, this kind of thing has been rare in this country. 
Obviously, the governing party always has an easier time raising money. 
There is nothing unusual about that. 
The answer, under our system, is the Canadian taxpayer.  
That is just not true. 
You never know - I might need their help one day.  
Honourable senators, this is not as far-fetched as it sounds. 
That is what he said. 
He then went on to say: 
We never know who's going to win. 
So we're always very prudent. 
I must say that it is not a very pretty picture. 
In fact, some of the reporting is quite shocking. 
I heartily recommend these articles to honourable senators.  
Everyone has a right to contribute to the party of their choice. 
I have no argument with this. 
It is our system. 
I have done my fair share of fundraising and contributing.  
In my opinion, money does not buy influence in this country. 
It does, however, procure access. 
I believe we can all agree with this.  
Honourable senators, I have strayed a little from my point. 
Money is crucial to making our political system work. 
It is only logical.  
How we balance these competing views is a difficult issue. 
Indeed, public funding would not cost the taxpayers much more.  
Political parties waste large amounts of money each year, as we all well know. 
By doing so, we reduce both the pressures and the opportunities for misuse. 
It was an important moment. 
In that light, this particular reform is extremely important.  
The Honourable Senator Lucie Pepin has been actively involved in this issue. 
She was to have spoken today. 
We live in a strong and very dynamic democracy. 
Our institutions, laws and practices serve as models to the nations of the world.  
We gained that reputation through reflection and work. 
This is the third time that the Canada Elections Act is amended since 1992.  
We have a few ideas as to how that could be done.  
We think before we act. 
In 1991, the Lortie commission put forward a number of specific recommendations. 
The report received unanimous support from every member of the Royal Commission.  
Happily, a provision of this sort is found in Bill C-2.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is the honourable senator seeking leave to continue?  
Honourable senators, I would seek leave to continue.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is it agreed?  
Is striving for gender equity in Canadian politics so radical? 
Were the recommendations of the royal commission so revolutionary? 
I believe we all think not.  
I hope it does not take another seven decades.  
Honourable senators, in short, should we support Bill C-2? 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Kinsella for raising that issue. 
I thought about it while Senator Finestone was giving the speech. 
I will do my homework and also seek advice on the matter. 
I will take it under advisement.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Does the Honourable Senator Cools wish to speak at this time?  
Honourable senators, perhaps Senator Finestone should provide some clarification. 
I did not hear all of the speech she presented. 
In other words, one cannot vote by proxy and one cannot speak by proxy.  
Can we have some clarification from Senator Finestone as to exactly what just happened? 
I was under the impression it was Senator Finestone's speech. 
Honourable senators, I hope I have not inadvertently breached any rules of this house. 
In essence, Senator Pepin showed me her text. 
In essence, honourable senators, I collapsed two speeches into one. 
I was totally in agreement with my colleague's point of view. 
I hope that I did not breach any rules and did not do anything terrible. 
The chamber still deserves some clarity. 
However, within the Senate or within Parliament, parliamentary personalities are indivisible. 
It is not possible to split a parliamentary persona.  
Having said all of that, I just wish I had listened closely. 
If that is what happened, then it would be Senator Finestone's speech. 
I am also very mindful of the fact that Senator Finestone intends no wrong. 
I believe she is attempting essentially to do a favour for a friend senator.  
I think that we should take these variables into account. 
Perhaps we can proceed from there. 
It is a serious problem.  
Is it possible to adjourn this debate?  
I do tend to pay close attention to rules. 
Those are positive things. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
However, I thank Senator Kinsella for raising it.  
This is a different situation.  
I support the reference. 
I do not know whether that offends the rule. 
I look forward to the ruling by the Speaker. 
I do not believe that a point of order can be adjourned. 
Honourable senators, the current debate is on a point of order. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted to withdraw the point of order?  
After all of that, will the senator accept a very short question?  
Second, I was not even a person at that time. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
Report of National Finance Committee on Supplementary Estimates (B) Adopted 
Honourable Senator Murray, P.C. ). 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
Report of National Finance Committee on Main Estimates Adopted 
Honourable Senator Murray, P.C. ). 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Estimates, 2000-01 
Report of National Finance Committee on Main Estimates Adopted 
Honourable Senator Murray, P.C. ). 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Appropriation Bill No. 4, 1999-2000 
The Senate referred them that same day to the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance. 
At that meeting, officials from the Treasury Board Secretariat appeared. 
Later the same day, the Senate adopted that report.  
Honourable senators are aware of the conditions of western farmers.  
I take this opportunity to welcome him.  
We tend to overlook the crucially important role of municipalities in environmental matters. 
The second matter I wish to raise concerns genomic research. 
I have two other matters, honourable senators, to which I wish to speak. 
These costs, as we have learned, are not trivial. 
Senator Ferretti Barth has raised this matter on several occasions. 
With those few comments, honourable senators, I commend this bill to your support.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Obviously I am interested to see that some of it be expended in Atlantic Canada. 
Many legal, social and ethical issues surround this issue. 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
There is a huge investment on the part of private enterprise in this research. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Sometimes it almost sounds as though it is a discourse for number crunchers. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
What these proposed changes do is help Canadian corporations in two quite different ways. 
The same is true for so-called "going-private" transactions. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Appropriation Bill No. 1, 2000-01 
Keith Coulter, Kevin Lindsey and Andrew Lieff.  
That report was adopted a few moments ago. 
The process of determining interim supply is as follows. 
There are four votes for which eight-twelfths are being sought. 
The custom is until March 31 of the next year. 
The Treasury Board officials are excellent witnesses. 
The report is factual. 
That is a great deal of money for debt servicing. 
Meanwhile, I commend this bill to your consideration and support.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The point is that we have very important leverage. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, I would thank Senator Kinsella for his intervention. 
Perhaps he is still planning to ask a question.  
I held that position then, and I continue to hold it now. 
The first purpose was to express the federal principle. 
The House of Commons is constituted and constructed as a unitary house. 
Therefore, the federal principle is in the Senate, not in the House of Commons. 
That is rubbish and nonsense. 
As a matter of fact, it is a menace. 
The option was there at the time to have the Senate elected. 
Many of the legislative councils that yielded to the Senate were elected. 
As I said before, all of this is off the cuff. 
The Senate's powers in respect of this particular bill are huge. 
I am mindful of those thoughts and I am sensitive to them. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Financing of Post-Secondary Education 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Future of Canadian Defence Policy 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Review of Anti-Drug Policy 
Motion to Form Special Senate Committee- Order Stands 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum 
Eighth Annual Meeting-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs rose pursuant to notice of March 23, 2000: 
All of us visited the chambers, the main hall and many of the 27 patios. 
They are fascinating buildings. 
In fact, there are seven buildings, and the courtyards are all over the place. 
Honourable senators, I learned a great deal on this trip. 
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Review of Non-Proliferation Treaty 
Hon. Douglas Roche , pursuant to notice of March 21, 2000, moved: 
However, the problem did not go away. 
The U.S. Senate has rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
Meaningful discussions at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva are deadlocked. 
They are not just an advanced form of ordinary weaponry. 
Second, the NPT review conference. 
Israel has also not signed the NPT and has become nuclear-weapons capable. 
Finally, honourable senators, let me speak of Canada's role. 
The non-proliferation treaty must be saved from unravelling. 
I commend this motion to you.  
We are very fortunate to have this gentleman in our midst as a senator. 
Is it a major concern? 
Is it a major issue for Canada? 
These threats with respect to nuclear weapons, at their most basic, imperil all humanity. 
Our human security is at risk.  
Well, honourable senators, they are. 
It is not possible.  
The forces of globalization are another matter. 
I sat on the Foreign Affairs Committee in the other House. 
They highlight our common humanity and connect us in a common destiny.  
One of our honourable senators, Senator Pearson, is very involved in that the latter. 
All eyes will be focused on all these issues. 
There is, quite frankly, no greater potential menace to human security.  
The risks associated with nuclear arms appear to have faded from the radar screen. 
Do we hear anyone talking about it? 
We must be concerned about this.  
The risks associated with nuclear arms seem to have faded from international concern. 
We seem to have lost our way. 
Honourable senators, I do not think it can be accomplished overnight. 
Let us be under no illusion about that. 
However, the dangers are real enough. 
The threat to horizontal proliferation is evident. 
Vertical proliferation, however, remains a challenge.  
It is hard just to get rid of them. 
The prospect of the illicit transfer of nuclear weapons is very disturbing.  
An effective NPT is the centrepiece of a non-proliferation regime. 
There are only four states that have not signed it. 
The success of this conference is crucial. 
I suggest, however, that the outlook is quite clouded. 
In these circumstances, it is not surprising that there should be concern. 
They are a vital and important force.  
I would commend the NGOs to continue their effort. 
Our Minister of Foreign Affairs certainly knows. 
A senator brought that to our attention. 
This is the ultimate evil.  
Honourable senators, I hope we will move on this motion. 
It is well founded and most fortuitous at this particular time. 
I hope the discussions go well on April 24 and afterwards.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Perhaps we should review what was happening then. 
This is why it is a solidarity issue. 
I simply submit that proposition.  
Sometimes it would appear that non-governmental organizations are ahead of governments. 
We need not be surprised by that. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt this motion?  
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Government Motions: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, March 29, 2000, at 1:30 p.m.
