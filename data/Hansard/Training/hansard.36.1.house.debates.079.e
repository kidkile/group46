GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
ENERGY PRICE COMMISSION ACT 
The bill links the issue of price control to competition. 
RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Where do we expect this prudent approach to budget planning to take us?  
In my view this would be shortsighted and, quite frankly, bad economics. 
They will also support limited terms of studies in other countries.  
What that means is that more graduates will be eligible for interest relief.  
Bill C-36 implements this commitment.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Finally there is no net tax relief in this legislation. 
I want to make my point by speaking in the form of a metaphor. 
Taxpayers are like the goose that laid the golden egg. 
All members acknowledge that. 
They want a system that ensures they can get a decent education. 
Ottawa scoops up at least half of all the income of the average Canadian today. 
That is a tremendous amount.  
That is exactly what is happening today in Canada.  
Sadly that has been the case for a long, long time. 
When those sorts of things happen, there are real consequences.  
They have all these goslings that have to be looked after. 
They have to feed the people they are responsible for. 
They are starting to cast about for other alternatives.  
Taxes are lower and there are more jobs in their field.  
They are fleeing in droves. 
We also have to point a finger at the federal government. 
Is it any wonder that British Columbia today is entering a recession? 
We understand the need to invest. 
The government talks about a balanced approach. 
Three jobs are chasing every one person. 
It is the complete reverse to Canada. 
He raised this issue with me as a serious consideration. 
The budget has done nothing to address that problem.  
My friends may call that progress but it is a perverted view of progress. 
We are going backward.  
What can they do? 
They cannot do that. 
They need to pursue opportunity wherever it is.  
My friend from Red Deer has a son who is now teaching at Princeton. 
What is going on with this country? 
He has two daughters. 
One is in Norway and one is in the Netherlands. 
They had to leave to pursue opportunity. 
We have a problem.  
The millennium scholarship fund will end up being a subsidy to Microsoft. 
What about the balanced approach? 
Why has the government not addressed this problem?  
The Liberals forget that big chunks of the country are in serious trouble. 
In many parts of the country there are no prospects.  
This lady is complaining about the amount of tax she has to pay. 
That is a staggering amount of money.  
It is killing opportunity and is driving people from the country. 
This has to come to an end.  
I guarantee they will be sorely disappointed. 
The symbolism of having that relief on the wall is interesting. 
It is the only tax relief we have in Canada today. 
There are a couple of interesting symbols just below that family. 
At the very bottom we see a whale. 
The final figure is the man with the briefcase just on the right hand side.  
The member for Peace River has correctly identified the taxman. 
I conclude with the following amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am afraid there is not consent.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are having fun and we are wondering why. 
The Minister of Finance refused to respond. 
We therefore called for three things relating to the employment insurance fund. 
He has not met the expectations of the Bloc Quebecois. 
This limits our job creation capacity. 
Instead, however, he preferred to keep taxes high. 
The Minister of Finance took $30 billion out of our pockets. 
The minister made us wait. 
We have to remember that.  
He did nothing, and we see the results. 
He he turned a deaf ear and did as he pleased. 
Education is the backbone of the survival and progress of every nation. 
Education is the basis of any people's survival.  
When it comes down to it, every Quebecker is a nationalist. 
This is something we will fight against until our last breath. 
We will repeat this demand ad nauseam. 
I am referring to the Minister of Finance's accounting practices. 
This makes no sense.  
This method of accounting produces the following sort of nonsense. 
It is a shame to present things in this fashion.  
It is all done with smoke and mirrors.  
This is an outrageous approach. 
We also looked at the deficit forecasts for the previous year.  
Six months later, in Vancouver, he confirmed that our figures were right. 
But that is not what the people want. 
The answer is that he likes to hide the truth. 
He puts it under general revenue. 
The Minister of Finance is really starting to get on our nerves. 
Thirty billion dollars in four years ain't peanuts. 
He also asked them to make unwarranted sacrifices in the area of social assistance.  
There are $30 billion in cuts still to come.  
On the government side, they are bursting with pride over this. 
That is the reality. 
They will take $30 billion dollars away from it between now and the year 2003. 
People were angry with the Minister of Finance. 
The minister will pay for this.  
We are going to repeat them over and over again, and that is not all. 
These are things we are going to say and keep on saying.  
We are not about to give up. 
At the least, the minister appears to be in conflict of interest. 
He could be in total conflict of interest. 
That having been said, I turn the floor over to my other colleagues. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
My adopted province is Saskatchewan. 
For the fifth year in a row the Saskatchewan budget is balanced.  
The provincial budget also includes increased investment in jobs and economic growth. 
This is after totally eliminating the deficit. 
This is a stunning achievement. 
The Saskatchewan budget is one thing. 
The federal Liberal budget is quite another. 
In 1995 the government did its polling. 
Therefore the finance department packaged a budget that contained few new tax increases.  
Of course that was not the case. 
Don't worry, be happy. 
This is what the Liberals have done for health care.  
We have a social deficit. 
Who is paying for this deficit? 
What else is not in the budget? 
The budget speech was entirely silent on agriculture. 
This year's budget confirms even further cuts.  
They have totally forgotten rural Canadians.  
What are they doing to represent the interests of rural Canadians at the cabinet table? 
The answer clearly is not much.  
I want to turn to post-secondary education and the millennium fund.  
Now they will use new spending to privatize education.  
Here is how it will work. 
Universities and technical institutes have been starved for funds. 
Their roofs leak and buildings threaten to collapse onto students. 
Let us deconstruct this for a moment. 
This foundation will determine which students are worthy of receiving these scholarships. 
People in Canada are more insecure than ever. 
This is the brave new world of the Liberals. 
I think that we are reaching the point of absurdity, in terms of inequalities. 
Any guesses as to who might have said this? 
Did he really mean it? 
What was he up to? 
He certainly has not.  
I submit that is changing. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This would put them in line with other businesses. 
Do they not benefit from this type of initiative?  
I want the hon. member to answer to that.  
Students from rural Canada who are dealing with student debt will benefit from this budget.  
Brock University put in place a university course for winemaking. 
Do they not benefit from these types of initiatives?  
Rural Canadians benefit from a balanced budget. 
They are now faced with low commodity prices.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for everything he said. 
I totally agree with what he said. 
I would like his opinion on a few issues.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
This is as a result of the changes from unemployment insurance to employment insurance.  
The lists are growing. 
We read about it every day. 
There is no new money in this budget. 
I touched on student loans in my remarks. 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. 
Should we not be applauded for that?  
Should we not be applauded for that as well?  
For political reasons the Liberals have chosen to go at it another way.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
What did the budget do for tax relief in this country? 
In fact, the Minister of Finance has said so on different occasions himself.  
This government lacks transparency in the area of employment insurance. 
That is what its policy is doing.  
In the last election we saw the carnival booted out of Atlantic and western Canada. 
For years now education has been a responsibility of the provinces. 
In my mind it is a modern day Avro Arrow program.  
What about the students of today and next year? 
The Liberals have feed the brain drain from this country. 
These values are not to be sacrificed. 
The government has ignored these concepts and values. 
Canadian seniors rely on three basic sources of income. 
It has done so in piecemeal fashion with the bottom line as its consideration. 
Some would ask why the seniors benefit is an issue. 
It certainly was not an issue in the budget. 
Canadians of all ages must understand its consequences. 
In the budget it resembles less than a flattering wailing of a trombone.  
Once broken they will break free and bring true balance to our economy.  
If we do, we will meet a specific target. 
When we get there we will be able to reduce taxes further.  
Those should have been lessons learned in the budget. 
Our party firmly believes that we need a plan for economic growth. 
The budget is more than just about numbers. 
It is not good enough to shift numbers around.  
We believe in a plan for stronger economic growth. 
We can reallocate priorities. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Putting more money into people's hands is good for the economy. 
From a political standpoint it was a good budget. 
Why is the budget balanced? 
We are talking about free trade, which they voted against. 
We are talking about surtaxes, where the money comes from.  
I cannot say that the government has not done anything. 
I will be honest. 
I could not say that. 
I would be lying and I do not like to lie. 
I am not a liar. 
The government has done something. 
Nobody knows more than Canadians the effect of these slashes. 
People are looking for beds in hospitals throughout Canada and cannot find them. 
This is what the government has done.  
I hope that we have the ability and the political will to do so. 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raised the issue of hope.  
We have investments from companies all over the world. 
I would also like to suggest that the story in my riding is not unique. 
It is being repeated all across the country.  
The opposition repeatedly distorts the facts by focusing on selected tax measures.  
I would like to ask a question of the hon. member. 
What planet is he on? 
He also mentioned that I should visit his riding. 
I would like to bring to his attention my riding, the people I represent. 
I will give him the number from my riding. 
It is not more EI. 
It is to find solutions.  
We know what they think.  
I invite the hon. member to my riding as well.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I agree that we have to attack the debt. 
We have said this all along. 
There is a balance to be found and we should look for it.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Imagine the federal government involved in home care.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
I agree with him entirely.  
That would be much better for everyone. order 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
You will find unanimous consent for the following motion: 
I moved an amendment to the motion in question. 
If so, we would support the government whip's motion.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
These are some of the items that my constituents have mentioned to me. 
The Minister of Finance has clearly accomplished that. 
The era of overspending is behind us forever. 
I know that my constituents are breathing a sigh of relief. 
They want their hard-earned tax dollars to be spent wisely and prudently. 
People should expect nothing less from their government. 
We are delivering and will continue to do so. 
This will assist about 65,000 Canadian families with children. 
It is yet another piece of good news from the budget.  
Small business is the backbone of my riding. 
This will reduce payroll costs for the employers by $100 million a year. 
Both these actions could reduce payroll costs by $1.4 billion.  
This is certainly an excellent step forward. 
I think it is wonderful''.  
For what we ask the rural firefighters they are given very, very little in return''.  
Many of Canada's important industries such as agriculture are based in rural communities. 
These primary industries account for almost half of Canada's exports. 
My riding includes some of the best dairy farmers in Ontario. 
Agriculture is the lifeblood of my riding and of southwestern Ontario.  
These additional funds will be used to encourage economic growth and diversification.  
The budget marks a significant accomplishment for Canada. 
We can finally look forward to the future with renewed hope and optimism.  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from Elgin-Middlesex-London for the question. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I too represent and was born in a rural riding. 
I do not know what planet my distinguished colleague from the government party comes from. 
I would like to ask my hon. colleague from the government side a question. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question. 
I appreciate his question. 
There has not been any indication in this budget regarding that.  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
As many members have stated, this budget is very historic. 
More needs to be done. 
I will return to that point toward the end of my speech. 
Let me highlight what I think are the major accomplishments in the budget.  
It is more important than the balanced budget. 
It is more important than tax relief. 
Jobs are the real issue in this country. 
Having said that, however, we cannot underestimate how important balancing the budget is. 
That is a tremendous achievement. 
It is all based on having a balanced budget.  
Approximately 1,000 jobs will be created in a new plant Magna is putting in. 
Freightliner is making a major investment to build highway trucks in my riding.  
The unemployment rate has been cut in half over the past five years. 
Farm incomes are up. 
It is not enough. 
We need to lower taxes even more. 
It is a step in the right direction. 
I believe quite firmly it is a trend. 
That represents approximately 1,200 people in my own community.  
That sounds very much like Liberal policy. 
Do we hear the Reform Party applauding us? 
We reduced the EI premiums again, effective in 1998. 
I will turn my attention to the Bloc for a moment. 
The 1998 budget delivers. 
Should the Bloc Quebecois not be applauding us for this measure?  
Do EI premiums need to come down even more? 
They certainly do but at least it is the start of a trend.  
The Liberal budget increases funding to research granting councils. 
Should the NDP not be applauding these measures?  
Our budget increased the child care deduction by $2,000 per child. 
I will turn last to the Progressive Conservatives. 
The leader of the Tory party promised a balanced budget by the year 2000. 
That was in its 1997 election platform, ``Let the Future Begin''. 
Only two years later we delivered a zero deficit. 
The Tory's 1997 platform promised to start a $100 million Canadian merit scholarship program. 
Our 1998 budget introduced a $2.5 billion millennium scholarship fund. 
Surely the Tories can applaud us for investing in higher education. 
The Tory plan for growth asked for the basic exemption to rise. 
All these measures are in our 1998 budget.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, let me address the preamble to the question. 
I agree with the hon. member. 
However, I think we should learn from the lessons of the past. 
We have to find ways to use the EI fund in a more creative manner. 
I agree with the hon. member on that.  
We can afford to do both. 
We have to be mindful that this is the worst time to be raising premiums.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
This, in my opinion, is a questionable technique.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
That gives the folks over there a little less time to talk to me.  
The values in that come from many places. 
I remember some of the values my mother gave me. 
Those are values in my case that came from the maritimes. 
Those are values that should exist throughout the House. 
There are other significant tests of values. 
These young people are taking out student loans. 
The difference is this. 
It has little regard for the financial need of the student. 
Whereas a bursary is based on financial need.  
There is nothing wrong with that, in totality, at times. 
However, the government has totally ignored the needs of financially impaired students. 
They do rather well at that. 
At the same time it suggested that it had balanced the books. 
The facts are this. 
That is 100% accurate. 
As an accountant I have seen it time and time again.  
We are going to blow it''.  
The auditor general agrees with you, Randy.  
If we spend it, it goes on the books in the year we spend it. 
If we do not spend it, it does not go on the books.  
It is a scholarship, like I said before. 
It is given to those with the highest academic performance. 
Ask any of these students who are sitting around in this place. 
They know what I am talking about. 
I question what this government is really looking for. 
It would be much more appreciated.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Yes, that could have been done.  
The point is that this government had a surplus of approximately $3 billion. 
Once a surplus is declared, of course, then comes accountability time.  
These are the very issues that this government has a problem with. 
That is why the government is trying to use any kind of surplus dollars.  
The answer is clear to me. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Liberals deserve the credit for bringing in the first balanced budget in 30 years. 
They chose to put $2.5 billion into the millennium fund. 
Regular Canadians would go to jail if they tried to do the same thing.  
Let us look at the amount of support the Liberals are talking about. 
Now that is under question.  
Why did the government choose this particular avenue? 
Another major problem with this is the ego of the Prime Minister. 
He wanted to have a legacy to leave behind. 
This has not happened for the past six years. 
Inflation has risen 9% over the same period of time. 
Let me outline how much money we are talking about. 
Canadians already pay enough taxes. 
The federal government is putting far too little back into that province. 
Other provinces received much higher amounts from the federal government. 
British Columbia, lo and behold, received only $524 per citizen from the federal government. 
And by the way, don't count on us for any support or help''.  
The Liberals cannot have it both ways. 
That is very scary for all Canadians.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is part of the activities for 1997-98. 
We made it quite clear that we pay for what we announce. 
We pay our bills. 
We tend to pay as we go.  
It is not really the accounting issue which the Reform Party has a problem with. 
That is really the problem.  
I will ask the hon. member more of an accounting question. 
The books close March 31. 
Adjustments are essentially made in August. 
At the request of the auditor general those adjustments are audited and scrutinized. 
Does the hon. member know that? 
She is arguing about the fact that we are not being transparent. 
We cannot get more transparent. 
If our transparency goes beyond the requirements of public accounting, so be it. 
I will let Canadians judge that.  
I have a question for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance. 
It was very clear with this millennium fund. 
This was not a balanced budget; this was a surplus budget. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
I rise in this House today for two reasons. 
I thought to myself ``My goodness, it's Howard Stern''. 
No, it was the Bloc member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
They cannot think of anything to say.  
One thing is for sure, every time I hear- 
The hon. member for Levis, on a point of order.  
Props are not allowed on members' desks and he is talking about unparliamentary props.  
Mr. Speaker, sometimes the truth hurts. 
He spoke of almost falsifying and almost lying. 
Those who have nothing to say keep attacking members' integrity. 
He is undermining not only his own cause, but this institution as well. 
I am going to speak about the budget, unlike the members opposite. 
There are some important things in the budget. 
It is an excellent budget, as the member for Frontenac-Megantic has said. 
Because it is historic. 
The result is a zero deficit budget.  
Delivered on the backs of the unemployed and the provinces.  
Mr. Speaker, one thing is sure. 
The issue of fairness was raised, but it is a start. 
Nothing is perfect in this world. 
We had to pay $42 billion and find fair and- 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
At the expense of the unemployed.  
But we also did something that hurt sovereignists even more. 
We talked directly to young people. 
Of course they are going to come up with examples. 
Members opposite will say that journalists are federalists. 
The young people were asked ``What do you think of the millennium fund?'' 
Members opposite are also going to tell us we are interfering in education. 
We will sit down with them and use the same parameters.  
When young people graduate from universities, CEGEPs and high schools, they are in debt. 
The debt reduction strategy includes seven components. 
There are, of course, the Canadian scholarships. 
The millennium fund is great. 
About 100,000 young Canadians will receive scholarships. 
How can anyone be opposed to these initiatives?  
We heard what the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot had to say. 
He said they had been energized. 
Does this mean they had no energy before? 
It is their problem. 
I rely on the public's judgment. 
Many of my constituents phoned me. 
I spend a great deal of time in my riding. 
My constituents did not criticize the budget. 
The facts speak for themselves.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
The income per person has gone down just about 10 rating points.  
These are things that will have an impact.  
And you are how old?  
The budget is not the only thing. 
These are facts that attest to good management.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
An excellent question, Mr. Speaker. 
You have to understand one thing. 
They say ``Finally, we have a government that keeps its promises''.  
The member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot is calling me a liar- 
You are a liar.  
I would send him packing, but that is my problem.  
One thing is sure, when you look at the facts- 
Who is the liar?  
Could you ask him to cool his jets and settle down? 
When he spoke, I let him speak.  
You were not here.  
Yes, I did listen to you. 
I am sure that if he said them, he will withdraw them.  
Motive is being imputed. 
You yourself admitted you did not hear the member say anything. 
I therefore think he should not be asked to apologize.  
He was heard by at least two members. 
I therefore did say he was a liar.  
I thank the hon. member for withdrawing his words.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the budget debate.  
This led to a very dismal economic situation. 
We also told them at that time that it was not going to be easy.  
The 1995 budget put that framework into action. 
All of us took the plunge at that time. 
We all knew that these decisions were not going to be easy.  
The reduction in government spending was unprecedented in Canadian history. 
Each province has different needs. 
However, the conditions of the Canada Health Act were and still are being maintained. 
We also decided in 1995 to make some very different choices. 
We chose to work in favour of a strong economy and a stronger country. 
Many governments have known and talked about the need for reform and renewal. 
Our government chose to stop talking and to start acting. 
It was very tough but we made it happen and here we are today.  
The economic recovery was indeed remarkable. 
In 1993 the deficit was $42 billion. 
The burden of debt in 1993 was very unmanageable. 
The 1998 budget puts in place the debt repayment plan. 
We have actually paid down $13 billion in market debt in the past year alone. 
The economy is now on the move upwards and growing. 
Consumer confidence is back and strong. 
Canadians are feeling very confident about their economy and about their country as a whole. 
That is what this budget has commenced doing.  
The 1995 budget made some very difficult decisions with regard to health. 
We did not have many choices at that time. 
Our backs were up against the wall. 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Experience shows that effective action can and must be taken now. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The list goes on and on.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
I extend my sincere congratulations to these two remarkable young women.  
QUEBEC'S FISCAL BALANCE 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
No, the separatists are to blame, according to the minister. 
Go ahead, pin it on the sovereignists, we can take it.  
The federalists are the ones who have plunged Quebec and Canada into debt. 
It is a good thing that the sovereignists were there to take things in hand.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday marked World Meteorological Day. 
ACADEMY OF MOTION PICTURES, ARTS AND SCIENCES 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
This award was also won by the University of Waterloo faculty last year.  
I congratulate these four winners and the University of Waterloo.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The list goes on.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
I cannot say how thrilled I was to finally see them.  
The Greys have waited almost two years for this moment.  
Delila and Gabriel can now resume their lives in Moncton. 
I wish them the best of luck.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
This diversity is our strength.  
Member spoke in Greek and provided the following translation: ] 
Long live Greece; long live Canada.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
I have the honour of being twinned with West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast. 
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs gave the oddest speech.  
We have seen things that made more sense.  
Who is telling the truth in this government? 
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday Reform members outlined their approach to health care.  
They want an Americanized, privatized two tier health care system. 
They want more competition in health care. 
Does the Reform Party care? 
We already have a crisis in our health care system. 
We need reinvestment to strengthen that system. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
It will create approximately 300 jobs across Canada. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Today we got our answer. 
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
It just means that they earn a lot less when they do work''. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I explained there is a reduction in Pacific trade that is affecting all Pacific countries. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Members of the committee looked at the original decision. 
We were not in government at that time. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This is a big fish story.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have always been in favour of transferring jobs. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
If there is any bungling the minister will have to take full responsibility''. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The minister was not there at that time. 
He has now received a report which he will study. 
We will all study the report and make changes as quickly as we can.  
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have been saying the same thing all along. 
We have always explained clearly the headway we were making.  
Each time, the Bloc Quebecois voted no.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I presented an argument to this effect. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
He said ``The more it hurts, the less support there will be for sovereignty''.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have tried and are willing to try to reform the Senate. 
We have a system of two houses in Canada. 
The member is proposing something that I cannot do. 
If I have an institution, I have to use it.  
But it is not what we are proposing at this time.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It needs the consent of the 10 provincial governments.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Does the Minister of Fisheries agree with this recommendation?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The member could not be further from the truth, Mr. Speaker. 
Colleagues, please direct your questions and answers to the Speaker. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
They have seen hundreds of meetings, two negotiators and countless empty promises.  
What is the result? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There are two countries to the treaty. 
We have to get agreement between the two countries. 
To follow the hon. member's advice- 
The hon. member for Vancouver Island North.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
The fisheries minister is always talking conservation, conservation, conservation. 
What about honesty, integrity and leadership on this issue?  
The priority of the fisheries minister has been to avoid upsetting the Americans. 
Meanwhile 5,000 fisheries workers are going to be out of a job.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
He criticizes the minister of fisheries for being concerned about conserving the fish stocks. 
If there are no fish, there are no fishermen. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We assumed our responsibilities.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we inherited this problem from the former government. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the senators I have named. 
They are working very well. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
He is going to make those same mistakes over and over again.  
When will the Prime Minister allow Canadians to democratically elect their own senators?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We made it very clear there are very basic standards that we apply. 
We concur with that kind of assessment. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It has responded to say it was not involved. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Will the Prime Minister now table all the names of his former employers? 
My colleague, I think we are stretching it a bit here. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, one thing that is becoming clear is that a pattern is developing here. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He serves on three committees. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They raised some very interesting points.  
FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Weather prevented military aircraft from offering immediate assistance.  
This is the case and the investigation is under way.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
This clearly was a special case. 
This was not someone out joy riding. 
This person put his own safety on the line to help somebody else.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is deeply committed to employment. 
Our priority is job creation.  
THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is very important that we address the issue the right way.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We have to abide by international obligations. 
We have already been offering fish to Canadians first.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, a very important round table meeting was held in Ottawa yesterday. 
There are approximately three ways of attacking the problem. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
In the present system, students from other provinces are penalized.  
Does the government feel that these different tuition fees are acceptable?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. member to put that question to me.  
We are making major improvements to the Canada student loan program. 
I could go on. 
This is the best achievement we have made in the last three months.  
CANADA LABOUR RELATIONS BOARD 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Can the minister explain why this was allowed?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Cooperation.  
Millions of children in North Korea are at risk of starvation. 
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Unfortunately the food shortage continues. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The minister has chosen to ignore some important facts. 
Westaim can and is ready to assure the supply.  
The hon. Minister of Public Works.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
However, he refused and decided to do something else. 
That is his business.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's allegation is totally false. 
We have followed the guidelines and are conducting an investigation on the subject.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We understand that the House of Commons cannot do this on its own. 
However, we do have an amending process. 
We can always recreate it in a democratic forum if we want to.  
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question, once again, is for the minister of fisheries.  
The reply from the parliamentary secretary was:
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Again I have to spell out to the member that there are certain international obligations. 
We do not want to destroy those jobs.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I ask her again. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
My colleagues, that would bring to a close our question period for today.  
I am going to deal first with a question of privilege. 
The hon. member for Scarborough Centre.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
In the letter the chair states: 
The order of reference given the committee was contained in two motions. 
The first motion which carried unanimously read as follows: 
That is why the supply motion called upon the government to act. 
The second part of the motion dealt with the committee. 
We often pass motions that prescribe the way debate is conducted. 
The actions in the motions are triggered by events that may happen during debate. 
That has not been dealt with since in the justice committee.  
You should not have walked out.  
I trust I did not hear ``I just lied''.  
When the protection of human life is involved we have to do everything we can''.  
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Speaker, there are three things that are very important here.  
There was no reference in that order to May 15. 
We have heard part of the letter. 
This is a terrible situation in which our committee is put. 
Let me say this, Sir. 
The order we have does not- 
I want to clear that up.  
As I said there were two motions involved. 
The first motion was time dated with an amendment from the government.  
We arranged for that. 
This is not something that only the Reform Party mandated. 
All parties in this House agreed to it.  
Colleagues, I think I have heard enough. 
I will not wait long on this. 
I want to have a look at the documents. 
I want to have a look at everything that has transpired. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It is a decision of the House.  
I do not want to get into debate. 
MEMBER FOR WINNIPEG NORTH CENTRE 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
She quoted me incorrectly.  
That is absolutely not true. 
I would like the member to withdraw that statement.  
I thank the hon. member for his clarification.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I think it is correct- 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
There are five minutes remaining for questions and comments.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
We could do this without any problems.  
If the minister's reasoning was good in 1994, it is still good today. 
And that is serious.  
It makes no sense. 
What is the government doing with the surplus it has thus managed to create? 
We are going to hold it at $12.5 billion''. 
In this context, pleased at having generated a surplus, what does the government do? 
I sat on the committee that studied this bill. 
The federal government itself controls its Student Loans and Scholarships Act. 
Clause 5 of the bill reads as follows: 
And here there is a big mistake in the French version.  
What questions will the House be allowed to ask on this? 
Which politicians will be allowed to ask questions on this issue? 
And that is not all. 
Quebec is part of the eastern region.  
But what about culture and social studies? 
That would keep costs from rising so quickly. 
They are concerned, and, as we know, the situation is different in the United States. 
We know that more money is being provided for research. 
Graphs are easy to do. 
It is still very little.  
The situation is serious. 
Universities are not built in a year. 
They are a bit like the country's demography. 
At least 25 years are necessary. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It costs them more to go to university in Quebec. 
It has nothing to do with culture. 
In fact young people in Quebec have an advantage because they pay less. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my honourable colleague for his question. 
Because there is a political desire to foster accessibility.  
It would be a kind of positive discrimination.  
It costs a lot of money to train a physician. 
We are making a collective effort to encourage education. 
We want Quebec to benefit from it as much as possible. 
That seems to me to be far from discriminatory.  
We know that universities are recognized as having different strengths in different disciplines. 
One cannot improvise with nothing.  
The Quebec loans and grants program meets students' needs. 
McGill University students are very happy with it and they do not want another program. 
The program is fair to all students. 
Negotiations can take place with students' associations. 
Incidentally, what kind of control do we have over this?  
I hope I am convincing people. 
It also requires that we put a lot of emphasis at first on the infrastructure. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
She has missed the point. 
Some have said that the millennium scholarship fund would only benefit 7% of students. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question in two parts. 
There is a student loans and scholarships act. 
And who will control all that?  
Let us put money into that structure. 
There is absolutely no other reason. 
I am sorry to interrupt the member, but her time has expired.  
Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I shall be splitting my time. 
Our last budget was the first of the post-deficit era. 
It had a format which I found quite compelling. 
At the centre of that theme was the millennium scholarship fund.  
We took a subject and we swarmed it. 
We really spent a lot of time on the whole access issue.  
There are compelling alternatives. 
There are many who would argue for a health care budget. 
There are others who would argue for a global warming budget.  
These two form a complementarity, a pair of bookends.  
Why pick this group of Canadians for next year's budget? 
What is the compelling argument, need or urgency? 
We have attempted to deal with that through the national child benefit system. 
That is not all. 
Our children have other problems. 
We know we have problems. 
We have to, within our own government, get our act together.  
We cannot afford to wait until we delineate who is precisely in charge of what. 
We know about national projects. 
The role of the federal government is not to dictate what the answers are. 
We do not measure that. 
If that is done the child will not be burdened with inabilities. 
This is a tremendous challenge. 
We have already started to do something about it. 
Coming out of that we can then work collectively. 
I emphasize that this cannot be dictated by the federal government. 
We have, for example, the community action program for children which is already in place. 
I regret to interrupt the hon. member, but his time has expired.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the government member. 
For some time now, we have watched our human capital deteriorate. 
This is now clearly evident in the province of Quebec, Montreal in particular. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
That is the way we are going to make social progress in this country.  
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I join the budget debate. 
Its programs can now become more responsive to the needs of business and communities.  
We are seeing tremendous progress when it comes to job creation. 
We are seeing that happen.  
This is very important to me. 
We have seen this happen with Ontario.  
In the very near term we will see that every community is hooked up.  
A rising tide raises all boats. 
We are all in this together. 
We are prepared to listen. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened carefully to the speech by the member opposite.  
I am surprised at his support for the federal government's centralizing attitude. 
It must listen to the private sector, but must intervene.  
He also spoke of great national visions and of national criteria. 
I wonder if he really believes in the federal system. 
In creating the federal government, the provinces delegated powers and jurisdictions. 
I could take the example of the millennium scholarships. 
And what does the federal government say? 
It says it will go ahead anyway.  
If it really wants to help the education sector, why- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
However, the federal government was created for a purpose. 
The provinces clearly saw that it was important to have a national view.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's question. 
I have a high regard for his opinion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unfortunately the hon. member's time has expired.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
My comments will be fairly brief.  
I want to say a few words about that. 
That government was very activist in terms of programs for ordinary people.  
That seems to have come to an end. 
That type of activism is gone.  
I also think of the multilateral agreement on investment, the MAI. 
All these things are charters. 
It is also international in nature. 
That is the kind of evolution we have been seeing. 
The government is very much part of that.  
What has happened to that Liberal Party?  
That is what has happened to the Liberal Party across the way.  
I saw Mulroney on television a few months ago. 
I know you agree with that, Mr. Speaker. 
The Liberals are sitting back there smiling. 
We think he is doing a courageous thing. 
He is a fantastic prime minister in terms of his policies. 
That is exactly what has happened.  
The GST is another policy. 
I remember the Liberals talking about getting rid of the GST, killing the GST. 
Here we are a few short years later. 
The old saying is that the more things change, the more they remain the same. 
This is the kind of trend which is happening. 
An example is the Foundation for Innovation. 
Again, who is doing that? 
There is the millennium fund. 
Guess who will be on the board? 
Again, members of the big business community will make determinations about those investments. 
That is what is happening in Canada.  
We are not seeing that same kind of activism when it comes to ordinary people. 
We have Liberals across the way who used to be progressive. 
The member from Toronto used to be very progressive at one time. 
Those are the things the Liberals used to talk about in their opposition days.  
He had an idea that we should have a small tax on international currency transactions. 
This should be discussed among the leaders of the G-7 or the OECD. 
We are seeing a real evolution in the world. 
Maybe for the first time we can do some of these progressive things. 
The Europeans have finally thrown off this yoke of conservatism, of Thatcherism and Reaganism. 
He is not a liberal; he is a democratic socialist leader. 
There is a social democratic alliance in Italy. 
Those progressive governments are being elected in Europe.  
That is something we can do, but we can only do that internationally. 
The power of the nation state is diminishing very quickly. 
We can do that if we have the political will and the political determination.  
That is the main point I wanted to make. 
We now have in our country a balanced budget. 
We are now going to be turning another leaf. 
We are now going to be opening another chapter of the book of Canadian history. 
The books are now balanced. 
There was a Liberal convention in the city just last weekend. 
They want to make health care a priority. 
They are concerned about the MAI. 
They are concerned about this right wing drift of the Liberal Party.  
I am sure there are Liberal backbenchers who feel the same way. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my friend's comments. 
The member made mention of the Liberal convention this past weekend. 
I was there as one would expect. 
It is a very positive creative process. 
I am not sure if the hon. member was at our convention. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
They are not people. 
Corporations are owned by shareholders. 
There has to be a balance. 
I am not sure what the question was, Mr. Speaker. 
What I am saying now is we have a balanced budget in this country. 
So why not be activist on behalf of ordinary people?  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is the Tory policy. 
That is not the Liberal policy.  
There will also be university presidents. 
If he cannot, I suggest that is his problem.  
He mentioned Tony Blair. 
He went on to say spending is not the solution to every problem. 
It is how the money is spent that counts.  
We have taken a balanced approach. 
We will continue to take that balanced approach. 
There was always a fiscal responsibility there. 
It is the same thing in the 11 years of Allan Blakeney. 
It has been Conservatives over the years- 
The member knows that.  
It is his friends. 
They were the reformers of the day who ran up the debts. 
That leaves a shortfall of $12 billion.  
I will give the hon. member a chance.  
Mr. Speaker, that is Liberal mathematics. 
I do not think the Canadian people will believe him on that. 
It turned this around within two short years. 
One can be fiscally responsible and progressive at the same time. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Tommy Douglas was a great Canadian, I might add. 
He contributed tremendous things to our country. 
I am sharing my time with the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest.  
Take a look at the policies of Tony Blair and the Labour Party in England. 
Let us leave that out of it. 
Leave my personal descriptions out of this.  
There is no question about that.  
I am not afraid to talk about the GST brought in by Brian Mulroney.  
Business people in my riding will say please stop already with all the changes. 
We have attempted to harmonize and we have successfully done so in eastern Canada. 
Now the other extreme has come in. 
It hurt but I got over it. 
I would not be here if I did not get over it.  
We have said enough of the overspending. 
We have to live within the means of this country. 
Help me to understand what we in the backbench are supposed to criticize. 
I guess members opposite do not want to support students. 
What did we do? 
We brought in some tax relief for students who graduate with debt. 
We brought in interest relief. 
The socialist answer to post-secondary education is that it should be free. 
It should become part of the social safety net. 
Most Canadians, certainly those I represent, would totally reject that idea.  
They do have to work hard to get through. 
These are post-secondary education institutions which are second to none in the world.  
We do not have that situation in this country. 
It just makes darn good sense. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, again we get into a balanced budget scenario here.  
Of course I have had a few calls about that. 
Who likes paying taxes? 
We would all like to reduce taxes. 
Let us take a look at what happened in Ontario. 
What is the outcome of that? 
Let us do it with a balance. 
I am confident we will do that.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question for the member across the way concerns the GST.  
I want to ask the member to answer very precisely a very precise question. 
She resigned her seat and faced a byelection.  
Was it a mistake? 
Does he feel guilty about it? 
Was it a mistake to promise to abolish the GST and then to- 
I heard the Prime Minister. 
Was that a mistake? 
Please answer the question very honestly and very straightforwardly. 
Was it a mistake?  
We have done that. 
We have balanced the books. 
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
I want to do so by looking at history.  
In 1988 we were in opposition. 
We listened very carefully to the government of the day, the Conservative government. 
Michael Wilson was the finance minister. 
There were no Bloc members in the House. 
Michael Wilson, year after year, stood and made promises. 
What did the Conservative government do?  
In 1986 the general surtax was brought in. 
To pay down the deficit and to pay down the debt. 
What happened to the debt? 
What happened to the deficit? 
We promised that we would eliminate the deficit and we were elected. 
We were given a mandate to do that, among other things. 
Lo and behold we had the Reform Party here. 
It was not the official opposition, but it was here. 
He did not want to say things on which he would be unable to deliver. 
What was the Reform Party's mantra? 
Of course they have forgotten about it now. 
They will never do that. 
All Liberals ever do is spend. 
We do not care who the finance minister is. 
We do not care who the Prime Minister is. 
This government has no credibility. 
They are Liberals and they are going to spend us into bankruptcy''.  
He has been measured in his responses.  
What are their tactics now? 
Their tactics are to cut taxes''.  
They were making fun of us that we would never cut the deficit. 
We start by saying that we are going to do something and we do it. 
Then we go beyond that and do a little more.  
What was the Bloc doing throughout all this? 
Quebec does not have enough. 
We can listen to parrots for only so long. 
The fact is, we run a country. 
There are 10 provinces and two territories, soon to be three territories. 
We have to divide everything. 
What is going to come true? 
One, no more deficit. 
What happens when there is no more deficit? 
We still have a big debt. 
How do we know that? 
That is the Liberal way. 
It is not about slashing to reduce things. 
Yes we agree we should cut taxes. 
I pay too many taxes in my opinion. 
Ordinary Canadians want to pay less in taxes. 
We have at least started.  
We are going to start by helping low and middle income Canadians.  
What did we do? 
Beginning in July of this year the basic personal exemption will increase. 
What does that mean? 
While we are doing this we are paying down the debt. 
The deficit is gone. 
We are paying down the debt. 
But we are also starting to give tax relief.  
That is why I am pleased to support this budget.  
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Going back to 1984 would have been sufficient. 
The Liberals are ones who had been in power. 
They were originally responsible for the Canadian debt.  
Today, the accumulated debt has reached $585 billion. 
I would like the hon. member to comment on this. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
I only had 10 minutes so I could only go back to 1988. 
Let us talk common sense. 
Because we were still paying down the deficit. 
We have gotten rid of the deficit. 
Now we will see the figures go down.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Because they finally opened their ears and heard the Canadian people.  
The finance minister keeps setting these loosey goosey targets. 
It took time to accumulate. 
We cannot do it overnight but it is going to be paid down. 
It is going to be paid down over successive governments with successive finances.  
I appreciate the member's honesty in congratulating us. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
We know now about his priorities. 
The Liberal government has once again broken its promise. 
The only visible target the government has put forward is that of spending. 
Last month's budget made one thing very obvious. 
It sounds wonderful but consider just how wonderful it really is. 
The fund is $2.5 billion. 
There are 100,000 scholarships. 
It is an impediment to sustained economic growth in our country. 
As a consequence student debt has risen dramatically.  
These are the root causes. 
These are the issues that need to be directly addressed by the federal government. 
Young Canadians want to work. 
They want to work in Canada. 
The challenge for this government is to create employment opportunities. 
This is done by giving them a fair start in life. 
We now see the repercussions of these decisions.  
I have answered that. 
On the backs of each other. 
Many Canadians have faced higher taxes and have lost their jobs. 
Businesses are closing due to the economic environment. 
Working Canadians have seen their personal disposable income decline by 1.3% since 1993. 
It is crucial that we solve the alarming trend that we know as brain drain.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
BILL C-36-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP) moved: 
They are being hit from all sides in this respect.  
That is happening less and less.  
We see the elimination or the reduction of a lot of youth programming.  
The community clubs are already volunteer organizations. 
That is another matter which has to do with the reduction of program funding.  
They are required to pay extra amounts to provide their children with these positive experiences. 
We need to encourage youth to engage in these kinds of positive activities. 
The evidence on that is pretty convincing.  
There might be some kind of ceiling on it. 
It does not necessarily have to be available to everybody.  
Such programs have been instituted in other jurisdictions. 
I recommend that the government have a look at that. 
It may see elements of a solution in what has been done in that state.  
I think this is one of the ways we can do it. 
This measure would go a long way toward doing that.  
I have a few other points I would like to put on the record. 
This is a community club run by volunteers. 
I think that should have been waived.  
I look forward to the comments of other members on my suggestion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.  
This will be good.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I hope he appreciates that.  
Overall benefits have increased by $850 million over three years.  
I want to step back to Motion No. 306 and the issue of priorities. 
However, let me give a mid-case scenario as an example.  
That is a substantial amount of money.  
A practical problem with this motion is the following. 
How should we define appropriate youth activities? 
Should the government be subsidizing golf or tennis lessons? 
Where do we draw the line between personal development and leisure?  
It reflects an important aspect of our tax policy and operating philosophy. 
Then it would be costly and difficult to administer.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in debate on Motion No. 306. 
First of all, I see several technical flaws with the motion. 
There is no standard definition of youth in any of the tax statutes.  
The cost of this tax expenditure is nowhere defined in the motion. 
I think this is entirely the wrong approach.  
The hon. member has touched on a very real problem. 
Picking and choosing certain activities is a form of social engineering. 
It was a temporary act which totalled 12 pages. 
We would raise the spousal amount to $7,900.  
In sum, we would deliver $2,000 of tax relief for the average Canadian family. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
We are talking about youth activities. 
I think the motion before us would help us reach that goal.  
The other element is that these costs can sometimes be considerable. 
I happen to see things very differently. 
Another important element is that it would promote volunteer work. 
In all these organizations, there are volunteers who put in several hours every week. 
It would also encourage new initiatives. 
There is the cost evaluation. 
Obviously this is not easy. 
Contributions must be sought from parents and from institutions. 
I think this is very important. 
For example, the Liberal and Reform members tell us this will be complicated. 
I think this is hiding behind the principle itself. 
This sort of consideration can be examined in committee. 
Legislation may have to be amended as a result.  
We already have a tax credit for charitable donations. 
Productivity in society has increased a lot in recent years. 
Banks for one are making huge profits. 
We are looking for ways to redistribute this increased productivity in society.  
I encourage the House to consider this sort of argument.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Young children or adolescents? 
I wonder also about the activities eligible for the tax credit. 
I do not know the answer but I do feel more clarification is required.  
Is it limited to not-for-profit organizations? 
Are private sector institutions included? 
Once again, the answers will have a definite influence on the impact of the motion.  
Would the government structure be even more complex than at present?  
Taxes are too high in Canada. 
This is a matter of priority. 
This kind of co-operative approach has proven successful so far.  
Many others require attention. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
It was a privilege to second this motion.  
My riding is probably no different from those of many in this House. 
My intention today in support of this motion is threefold. 
There is a centre sitting idle in my community. 
It used to be the north YM-YWCA in Winnipeg. 
That organization ran out of the funds it needed to stay open. 
We in Parliament can play a real role.  
Often the costs are beyond the reach of many parents. 
It is a tremendous need which needs to be addressed. 
This is a good place to start. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to speak on this motion. 
I must do that for a very simple reason.  
There is such a wide range of activities that our children engage in. 
Are we talking about summer camps? 
Are we talking about sports and music lessons, which have already been mentioned?  
However, I do not regret it for a moment. 
This would be a tremendously high proportion of a family's income. 
That extends to every area.  
It was fairly costly.  
I would like to propose something which is actually much better. 
We could all use it.  
It would help all of the families if we had a reduced tax load. 
Many families nowadays are really struggling. 
The government should be out of the tax picture.  
We are slaves to our tax system.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Beausejour-Petitcodiac will have two minutes.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I was a single mother for a long time. 
It is true that Canadians pay a lot of taxes. 
This really concerns me. 
We invest in post-secondary education. 
We should think twice when Reform talks about taxes. 
What is its real objective?  
We pay taxes for one reason: to get services. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
First of all, the new food inspection agency. 
Finally, compensation falls far short. 
The government must sit down with the sheep producers. 
I am obviously impatient to hear the government's response to these three questions.  
It was launched in 1945. 
There is no known link between scrapie and human diseases. 
There is therefore no reason to alarm the public.  
The carcasses of such animals are incinerated or buried.  
We will continue to work closely with the industry to combat this disease.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
They know we have a health care crisis.  
They reject absolutely that kind of system. 
Canadians deeply care about medicare. 
They want to see medicare preserved and strengthened. 
They know it requires certain things on the part of this government. 
What we need is action now. 
We need money on the table.  
There are several reasons why home care is so critical right now. 
We know it is a cost effective method. 
It took leadership and vision. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The message from the national conference on home care was very clear. 
They want us to do things right.  
It is a complex situation.  
There is a lot more work to be done. 
We are planning to do that over the next 12 to 18 months. 
That is what we will do.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
There were many other violations. 
It sounds more like Argentina in the 1970s than Canada in the 1990s.  
Women protesters were being singled out for strip searches in prison. 
An inquiry by the RCMP Public Complaints Commission is not enough. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It involved over 3,000 police officers.  
They have the power to review all the complaints. 
We await the report.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
No other companies made that investment. 
However, all potential polluters have an obligation to pay their share of the system.  
Taken as a whole these recommendations constitute a complete reworking of the existing regime.  
A decision by the Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans on fees is now imminent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.56 p.m.)
