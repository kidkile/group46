GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Canada Post Corporation is no better than the government. 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
I hope the government takes this into consideration.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I support the petition.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
The Inuit find the housing conditions at Nunavik extremely distressing. 
They consider the situation totally intolerable. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
Second, that a cash settlement be made for the Caldwell Band. 
Third, that Treasury Board not advance funding for the settlement of this land claim. 
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 235 will be answered today. 
Question No. 235- Mr. Eric Lowther: 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Federal government is extremely concerned about the underground economy. 
Revenue Canada has taken the following specific actions with respect to the underground economy:
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 
Her assistance has been invaluable.  
What is the CEPA legislation all about? 
The screening is to be completed in seven years.  
The existing CEPA is based on the philosophy of pollution control. 
We want Canada's industry to stop pollution before it happens.  
It instructs us on our environmental problems and guides us toward solutions. 
This legislation enhances the intergovernmental partnership that we have already built in Canada. 
They would ensure a proper degree of clarity throughout the act. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
We have been working on this bill for an awfully long time. 
It is nice to see it come to fruition.  
That encompasses almost every activity that takes place on this planet. 
Regulation is needed and it has to be done in a balanced way. 
That is something that we tried to do, to keep that idea of balance.  
I would like to ask for unanimous consent to split my time.  
There will be two 20-minute segments. 
The hon. member has 19 minutes remaining.  
There were hours and hours of committee meetings. 
Many of the amendments were supported and presented by members of the Reform Party.  
Our party supported more research in this area. 
That is what Canadians are expecting from us and that is what they should expect. 
The bottom line is a safer environment and sustainable development.  
The crops were in. 
The ground had been tilled. 
It had rained and it smelled fresh and just looked wonderful.  
The ground is too wet and they are still struggling in that regard.  
The soil has to be worked. 
In all instances every operation that takes place is very expensive. 
Chemicals and fertilizer are expensive.  
For the best results the right amount must be applied. 
This is done through soil testing and other methods. 
This is something we have learned over the years. 
We have started to produce more per acre than we have in years past. 
This must continue and I am sure it will.  
As well social and economic aspects have to be taken into account. 
It is not happening. 
To be in Canada at this time of year is an absolute treat. 
It is just great.  
That is a good rule to follow.  
I reminded the students that they needed to pay attention to the environment.  
I have great hope in future generations. 
All in all this time of year is very exciting. 
We have to limit those mistakes and continue to make headway. 
This is very important. 
We support the participation of effective local communities in environmental decision making.  
Who has the ultimate power? 
This is where strong research is involved. 
We support the development of reasonable endangered species legislation, and I could go on.  
Going through this act has been an experience I will never forget. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, basically my colleague has reviewed our party's position. 
That is what happened. 
It brought forward some amendments. 
It was a well balanced act which then went to committee.  
The problem was the make-up of the committee. 
Unfortunately there was not a balance in the environment committee. 
This involved a lot of time and a lot of energy.  
The staff behind the scenes basically spent a year keeping this process going. 
It was extremely frustrating at times for all of us. 
There were only eight groups. 
Basically it could have gone through. 
We have a grand country. 
We need to look after it. 
This bill does that. 
I know others will say that it is not a balance. 
We can have a vibrant and healthy environment and a vibrant and healthy economy. 
They are not independent. 
They can be together. 
That is what this bill does.  
It has taken a long time to get here. 
The member for Davenport has initiated a very timely review on pesticides. 
We support the bill. 
We look forward to seeing its passage through the Senate and becoming law.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Mr. Speaker, we have now reached the third reading stage of Bill C-32.  
I hope that she can comply with the rules in this regard.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Our position remains unchanged. 
Several recommendations were made in committee to improve this bill. 
I will mention a few in the course of my speech.  
The committee adopted about 160 of these amendments. 
It is clear that the government has not respected what was done in committee.  
Clause 65 now reads as follows: 
At clause 9, the bill provides that: 
Clause 9(9) reads as follows: 
The legislative and regulatory powers that the federal government is giving itself are very important. 
That is one thing the Bloc Quebecois deplores.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
One must wonder why so. 
So, where do we go with results like that? 
It is rather embarrassing. 
These are the recommendations of the Bloc Quebecois. 
They are not to be found in text of the bill. 
These are good reasons to oppose it.  
This type of management implies a change of mentality and attitude.  
The soil should be considered like a bank account. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada supports sustainable land management. 
We are proposing a comprehensive agricultural plan. 
What does this mean? 
These questions include the following:
Does the farmer participate in a government agricultural plan? 
From what source does the farmer get the information on which he bases his decisions? 
Does the farmer have resources that he is currently not using? 
What obstacles impede the use of soil conservation methods?  
This represents 88% of farms invited to participate. 
This is a first in Canada, in Quebec and in the world. 
Farming practices are always kept secret.  
This is the only way to obtain results.  
I wanted to mention this project because I believe it is very important. 
This is a tall order.  
They have to completely change their farming practices. 
However these are concrete measures. 
Because they are simple, these projects are useful, and people get on board. 
They are called pesticide free and pesticide reduced projects. 
They give a lot of visibility. 
These technology transfer and development projects deserve to be better known.  
Biotechnology is on everyone's lips and a major source of concern to many. 
Its results are often very interesting, but sometimes also very worrisome.  
The applications of biotechnology are multiplying constantly and at an increasingly rapid rate. 
I want to add something about biotechnology. 
There are some rather disturbing things going on. 
Fortunately, we just learned that Dolly is aging twice as rapidly as she should be. 
This may make cloners think twice.  
Is there an international or national code of ethics?'' 
This makes no sense, from both a scientific and human point of view.  
In my opinion, this makes for a rather dangerous situation.  
I now come to my third point, which is air pollution. 
This is not negligible in the context of air pollution.  
Some atmospheric changes may be inoffensive or even beneficial to humans and plants. 
The government would be advised to refer to biological agriculture. 
It contains some very interesting points, such as the following: 
I am not inventing this, I read it in the David Suzuki Foundation document.  
as was demonstrated by over 800 people attending a recent forum in Montreal.  
Quebecers' interest in this area should not surprise us. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
They are very conscious of changes that have to be made. 
The youth are telling us this.  
It impacts on us. 
Our youth are environmentally conscious. 
They will dominate this House of Commons. 
Youth are our future.  
Last night we made a major mistake. 
The Reform Party was lobbied. 
The Liberal cabinet was lobbied. 
The parliamentary secretary and the ministers were lobbied. 
This is what industry had to say about the committee's work: 
Application of virtual elimination. 
The minister will allow these limits.  
We wanted to phase them out. 
It is only ``limits of qualification will be set by the minister''.  
This country is in a loophole. 
Canadians want to phase out chemicals and toxic substances. 
The government says we will virtually eliminate. 
All members should be aware that the Senate does not have the exclusive right. 
It does not have the democratic representation to review these acts.  
This country has a process for creating acts and laws. 
I draw this to the attention of all parliamentarians.  
The committee had eliminated this. 
Aboriginal people are not defined in the bill. 
Their intrinsic knowledge is oral based. 
Giving that equal weight is a bold move under CEPA. 
We wanted to raise that issue.  
These are child specific areas. 
Any cost recovery required by the minister would not carry any weight.  
The issue of biotechnology was highlighted in the bill. 
It is a growing and very cautious industry. 
It is also a very non-transparent industry. 
I quote from the section on cost effectiveness: 
Ladies and gentlemen, parliamentarians, cost effective- 
We have to look at the beneficial screen.  
Even ministers do not want to become the Minister of the Environment.  
We should be preparing the environment for the future of our children. 
It should be part of the social caucus and economic caucus. 
However, it is being shoved to the side and belittled every day.  
Today we are discussing the pesticide issue. 
We cannot water down our responsibilities.  
This all goes back to cost effectiveness. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
One wonders what the Liberals are afraid to hear. 
I have news for them. 
There was no need to kill the debate. 
The secret is already out. 
Last year's report tabled by the Commissioner of the Environment stated: 
Let me take a moment to remind Canadians what environmental progress really sounds like. 
The Conservatives also eliminated lead in gasoline. 
The Conservatives also set up a UV advisory program. 
During the time we were in government the Prime Minister was once quoted saying: 
Those days are long gone.  
Five hundred and sixty.  
I am very appreciative of her comments.  
There were 150 government amendments.  
I was actually shocked to hear about that.  
I do not know exactly what is going to take place.  
I think Canadians should pay tribute to their personal sacrifices in that regard. 
It is not her political will by any means. 
I think it is the political will of the government.  
He is a primary player in cabinet. 
He could participate in discussions only. 
He could not move amendments. 
It was a small victory for the environment and human health.  
Maybe that is how the political system is supposed to work. 
In that aspect I maintain a degree of faith in the system.  
The act includes provisions allowing for civil suits. 
Individuals can now hold industries accountable for failing to abide by the law. 
The affected industry is then left to find a workable solution to the problem. 
If it does not, the minister is empowered to act.  
A pollution prevention plan is really a voluntary regulation. 
The government can say to industry ``You know your industry better than we do. 
We want you to control the releases that your process is causing''. 
I think that would have been a better option.  
We thought it was a very workable definition. 
It is our intention to support Bill C-32 tonight. 
However, having said that, there is still room for improvement.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
I think those are the ones she is referring to.  
It is already on side. 
I did not mean to say anything different in that regard.  
Ours wins every time.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
What would be the basis on which a risk assessment would be done?  
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member has brought forth a very constructive question. 
Science should be number one. 
We do not necessarily agree on that particular point. 
We support the precautionary principle. 
The government supports that concept, as do we. 
The Progressive Conservatives support that concept, as well as the NDP and the Bloc. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise a couple of questions. 
I do not know if he understood that last amendment.  
We support the concept of virtual elimination. 
The system we use is a risk based system. 
That is how we manage our toxins. 
We should not send a negative signal in that regard. 
The minister should have the power in certain circumstances to make a call.  
The member raised another issue with respect to the Senate. 
I categorically support an elected Senate in every way, shape and form. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
I will not keep members guessing any longer. 
It focuses on the cautionary principle. 
Also it improves the control of pollutants and certain waste categories. 
Internationally, there is a consensus. 
Finally, will the provinces really co-operate? 
These are all questions the bill does not, and cannot, provide answers for. 
The same is true in the area of aquaculture. 
This applies as well to biotechnology.  
This should be examined. 
I mentioned it in the series of questions I raised.  
Little by little, it would become a concern of cabinet as a whole. 
It will not be easy, but it is definitely the right road.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Unfortunately that is what this process has created. 
So much for the legal angle.  
That leaves the financial considerations. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Why would the official opposition support the bill? 
This claim and other claims need to be examined closely.  
Bill C-32 could have been a reasonably good law. 
Timetables must be set for phasing out all use of the most persistent toxic substances.  
What a great commitment to the status quo. 
We had strong articulation of the precautionary principle. 
That opportunity was lost. 
That was also defeated.  
It could have been a reasonably good law. 
It could have been a strong piece of legislation for the next 10 years. 
It could have put health ahead of industrial interest. 
It could have put the public interest ahead of investment.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
He is taking a minority position. 
The Europeans are denying beef access into Europe on a non-scientific basis. 
Health Canada has denied rBST on a non-scientific basis.  
This is as well as I can answer the hon. member's question.  
We also know the role of the official opposition. 
I think this is a very legitimate question. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Surrey Central.  
They look to governments to provide leadership in that area.  
We are more than aware that water is a precious resource. 
I am sure the developers of the chemical felt they had a good thing. 
What was the so-called scientific basis for this panic? 
We know that there are tens of thousands of chemicals in the environment. 
Just because they are from nature does not make them benign.  
There are plenty of non-smokers who might like to go that route. 
We need only look at the recent MMT fiasco to see where this leads.  
The auto industry did not want MMT. 
Some lobby groups did not want MMT. 
Industry hates uncertainty, and yes, that is important. 
Empirical studies indicate economic prosperity leads to a cleaner environment. 
Ask all the stakeholders.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his clarification. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
How many environmentally friendly amendments were proposed by his party? 
As I said in my speech, we will be supporting the bill with caution. 
We would still like to see some changes. 
We would like to see further things done. 
Let us look at what the stakeholders are involved with. 
Industry is what creates jobs.  
There has to be balance in everything we do. 
All of the actions in the reports must be based on scientific reports, not politics. 
That is the basis where we are coming from. 
It has to be a balanced approach.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member opposite has raised the issue of MMT. 
Science will demonstrate the risks. 
Does the member opposite recognize this fact?  
It has to be a balanced approach. 
The idea that it can be regulated through CEPA is good. 
It gives us an avenue we can work through.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The review we are debating today began in the last parliament.  
This is key to protecting our environment.  
Over 400 amendments were tabled in committee. 
One is ministerial power. 
The Liberals want to give the minister too much autocratic power. 
The third is a cost effective approach. 
All references to cost effectiveness in the bill have been removed. 
The Reform Party put forward amendments to address all those areas of concern. 
Canadians will support legislation that is practical and effective. 
Legislation must enhance our ability to improve environmental performance. 
Our approach to the environment must be balanced. 
We feel that strong federal leadership is needed for a commitment to sustainable development. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I highly appreciate the thoughtful question by the hon. member for Peace River. 
Sustainable development is a very important concept. 
That is our moral obligation.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
That is a good thing. 
There is a little bit of a contradiction there. 
Kids were playing outside. 
I should hasten to add that we put it through a cleansing system. 
We do not drink it straight out of the lake.  
This kind of situation is extremely important. 
Air quality is another issue I find quite interesting. 
I am not sure that is a particularly intelligent way of dealing with waste disposal. 
It is surely not an intelligent way of dealing with air quality.  
I particularly want to say that we are all busy doing various things.  
I have been travelling all over the country. 
I also work on citizenship and immigration issues. 
Of course there is the Minister of the Environment. 
I very much appreciate that.  
It is leaching right into the ocean. 
I will touch on another area of the bill which I think is vitally important. 
The bill provides the opportunity for an awards system. 
It is my view that Canadians want to be recognized for contributing to their communities. 
They want to be recognized for contributing to improving the environment. 
That is worth far more than some kind of income tax cut for a company. 
We can hope that we leave it in better shape.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Then sadly big business went to work. 
Among the usual threats was the threat of closure. 
That is almost invariable. 
Sadly we always do. 
We are scared that it will move its plants and stop investments. 
In some very key areas industry wanted diluted, we diluted them. 
Even then industry cried foul and it was diluted.  
We did not think it was perfect but we agreed. 
This morning the cat came out of the bag. 
I am sorry to say it is like a blind date. 
The introducer of the two lovers is big industry. 
He said that the committee must be balanced. 
All facts point exactly to the reverse. 
I am a member of the government. 
I cannot live with those things.  
I would like to stand with them. 
Sadly, I cannot support this bill.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I think it is commendable that he used the word balance. 
I would like to ask the hon. member, what exactly does balance mean? 
I would suggest to him that perhaps it is not an either/or proposition.  
It seems to me that to be environmentally friendly is a good plan. 
It is not an either/or proposition. 
That is not true. 
I would like him to clarify exactly what he believes the word balance means. 
What kind of balance would he propose for industry and environmentalists?  
The environment and the economy are certainly not enemies or adversaries. 
I never said that. 
It makes more money and it is a better corporate citizen.  
However, laws are not made for the people who observe them. 
We have to have laws for those who pollute. 
It is to the minority that these laws are geared.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
The side of big business was adopted almost word for word. 
They were the amendments that big business wanted. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
It goes back a long way, to the Brundtland report of 1987 and before.  
Our aboriginal brothers and sisters have understood this for 10,000 years. 
It has no place in society. 
There is no need for balance then. 
They will be happier. 
These are the people whom we are addressing in this legislation.  
That is why I would support a much stronger bill today.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The problem the Bloc Quebecois has is much more one of jurisdiction. 
We do not agree with the double net theory. 
I now turn the floor over to my colleague.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
However, we all know that the environment is a shared jurisdiction. 
It includes the great planetary phenomena and the smallest micro-ecosystems.  
At issue in that case was the jurisdiction of the federal parliament over the environment. 
Four of the nine judges concluded, and I quote: 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
I would hope that all members of the House recognize this indisputable fact. 
The buck stops here. 
It will be in this area that I will concentrate my remarks.  
Many toxic substances do not stay put once they are released into the environment. 
One might ask how this could happen. 
What will Bill C-32 do to reduce or eliminate this threat? 
The good work that is already underway to identify and manage toxic substances will continue. 
Bill C-32 incorporates the precautionary principle. 
These preventative or control actions must be finalized within the following 18 months. 
The goal of virtual elimination is a new term to the CEPA. 
Once in the environment- 
Mr. Speaker, I will resign myself to your direction. 
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
This is the largest generation of young people ever in history.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
However, there is one thing the government seems to have forgotten. 
Does the government not understand the international agreements that it has signed?  
I say we should forget the subsidies. 
Let the magazine industry compete on its own merit. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
The theme this year is Community Action on Clean Air and Climate Change. 
In order to celebrate Clean Air Day- 
The member for Whitby-Ajax.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, June is Leukemia Awareness Month. 
Unfortunately relatively little is known regarding the causes of leukemia. 
1999 GALIEN CANADA AWARDS 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
That is how bad it is on the prairies. 
Evidently it was not enough for this farmer.  
The farm income crisis is far from over. 
It is time for the government to wake up. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
The hon. member for Charlesbourg.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Rural regions are the soul of this country. 
PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Canadians were pleased to see a hero of our own 
She's talking to the PM and we can't imagine why 
She'd take time from her busy day to listen to that guy 
The differences can be revealed when looked at carefully 
Julie makes us raise a glass; the PM makes us fret 
Julie is an astronaut; the PM's a space cadet 
Julie gives us hope that if we try we can succeed 
The PM takes all hope away by taxing without heed 
Julie works together with her colleagues all the time 
The PM gets the whip out when his don't fall into line 
Julie will come home to cheers of hip-hip and hooray 
The only cheers the PM gets is when he goes away.  
WESTERN CANADIAN TASK FORCE 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
The hon. member for Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We all know that the loss of a loved one is a tragic event. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I congratulate the partners in the Global Vision program who made all of this possible. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The key to this event is partnership. 
I look forward to joining it tomorrow.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
That is why individual and group action is so important.  
Tomorrow, June 2, we will celebrate Clean Air Day. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He refers to aides and so on. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
That is the Prime Minister's speciality. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I have done this for 36 years. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I have helped my electors. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said he has helped his electors. 
He sure has helped a couple of them anyway.  
Mr. Gauthier got a $6.3 million CIDA contract. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member just made an accusation that is untrue.  
The ethics counsellor said that to the House of Commons.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Well he was right. 
They are different all right.  
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again accusations.  
The minister can give the information about the case. 
He was the lowest bidder. 
He put $2.5 million on the table. 
The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
He also called the Minister for International Trade, who rejected the request.  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The hon. member should also know that this is a French regulation. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Would it not be a further guarantee of success?  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
They want a system that encourages them to vote their values. 
With that in mind, I ask the Prime Minister this. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I asked the Prime Minister a decent policy question. 
He complains about mud slinging. 
I am asking him now. 
This is a decent question. 
Will he set up a committee in the fall to look at electoral reform?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a system that was established in Canada a long time ago. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this contract was awarded according to the rules in place. 
Members opposite have to stop with these innuendoes and accusations. 
They sully the name of parliamentarians who do their work honestly.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the longer the Prime Minister stays in office, the richer his friends become. 
I want the hon. member to go directly to his question.  
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
How does he explain that?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
There is 12% unemployment and it is staying there.  
I ask the hon. member to please go to his question.  
Mr. Speaker, these innuendoes are absolutely unacceptable.  
CIDA was there as an observer only. 
There was nobody from the Prime Minister's office present.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
These questions are impugning motives. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
He is therefore wrong when he says he does not own it any more.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I tried to get paid. 
The members of that party are desperate because they are sinking. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Quebec is the second largest producer of asbestos in the world. 
That is very important. 
This is too important.  
But a regulation of the French government is at issue. 
The hon. member for Cypress Hills-Grasslands.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this question is to the Prime Minister.  
The Prime Minister makes a lot of his ability to represent his constituents. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I never mentioned anything to the minister.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary is to the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Good projects are part of the role of a good member of parliament''.  
That is the way it was done. 
It followed the rules.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
However, the minister provided very few details.  
Mr. Speaker, the first infrastructure program was clearly a success.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour.  
What has the minister done to address these issues?  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us review the facts. 
I have never seen such despicable behaviour.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is right. 
I thought we were going to get a different kind of government. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I believe I have been very clear. 
I know that the truth does not interest them. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Canada Post could find $200 million to give to the government. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Previously it was sent to major urban centres.  
We are working very hard and we will continue to work hard. 
The results, audited by two auditors, tell us that we are- 
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. 
It may also be of interest to regional development agencies. 
As far as the Department of Natural Resources is concerned, the economics- 
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I ask the Prime Minister, why will he not do these three simple things?  
It was a competitive process. 
It was $2.5 million lower than the other bid.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister spoke of being a good member of parliament. 
Mr. Speaker, Transelec has done work with CIDA before. 
It actually worked on a contract awarded in 1985 to do similar work in Togo. 
To my recollection it was the Mulroney government that was in power at the time.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We can see that might just be a bit of a problem.  
After 36 years of political IOUs, it is now payback time, big time. 
I want the hon. member to go to his question.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is very simple. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We saved $2.5 million in giving this contract to the lowest bidder. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is quite simply our duty to the people of Canada.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
That is at a cost of $3,500 a page. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is a little like the pot calling the kettle black.  
It is really worth while.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
My question is fundamental. 
THE LATE DOUGLAS HARKNESS 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
They recognized the debt owed to their comrades in arms. 
This was reflected in Mr. Harkness' first speech in this place. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Douglas Harkness distinguished himself at war through his courage. 
For a time he was Alberta's only representative in cabinet.  
He maintained his attachment to the land and was very proud of it. 
I resigned as a matter of principle. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Harkness developed an interest in politics while teaching school. 
Appointed to the cabinet in 1957 he subsequently served as Minister of Agriculture. 
He took great pride in securing programs to assist the farming community. 
The government fell in a non-confidence motion the next day. 
I have only touched the surface. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Harkness was born in Toronto in 1903. 
He was a teacher and a farmer. 
In 1957, he was appointed Minister of Natural Resources and acting Minister of Agriculture. 
He continued to represent the voters of Calgary Centre until 1972.  
In 1978, he received the Order of Canada.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I remember the night Mr. Harkness resigned. 
This is something that happens rarely in Canadian politics, too rarely I might say. 
We have to admire that.  
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Virtual elimination is necessary to protect our health and that of our environment.  
A reactive or control management approach is often costly and time consuming. 
In some circumstances traditional regulations remain the best solution. 
Canada can learn from actions of other countries as well. 
Our children and our environment are depending on it.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
He was very concerned about the health of the trumpeter swan in the Wye Marsh. 
He was very concerned about what was happening around lead contamination. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. colleague for her question. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Two very important messages emerged. 
In his important book Environmental Health Risks and Public Policy:
Dr. Bates clearly takes a stand on the side of public health.  
I am convinced they can be met.  
And so am I. Unfortunately, Bill C-32 will not do this. 
This is our challenge.  
They forget that without a healthy environment the economy will suffer. 
Trickle down economic policies have not worked for the poor. 
To the contrary, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. 
The connections among economic, equity and ecological factors are inextricably woven. 
It is in fact a seamless web of interdependency. 
It is irrational, foolhardy and dangerous to overlook this.  
The fact that parliament has so fully incorporated their concerns is shameful.  
Unfortunately there are many. 
I would like to reiterate only some of the most problematic ones.  
There has been a weakening of the virtual elimination provisions. 
Overall new hurdles have been created on acting in a precautionary way. 
There has been a shift away from pollution prevention.  
Children are not small adults. 
There are other groups of Canadians who require special attention. 
If we respect these Canadians we must write environmental legislation as if their health mattered.  
It is a legacy that some day we will return to.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
I suppose there are some of us in the House who have supported the bill. 
We have lobbyists and we have lobbyists. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:
Uncertainty for industry is a big issue. 
That is what it says in the toxic substance management policy. 
That has often been missed.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:
This is a democracy. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
This legislation is a continuation of the Liberal agenda to deregulate. 
In effect, what we have is a virtual environmental protection act. 
The term virtual has come to mean that it is not real.  
We are trying to accommodate the economy as well as the environment. 
These are heavy metals. 
They do not go anywhere else. 
The minister's power will in fact be dissipated to the Minister of Industry. 
The cost to human health is far to high''. 
That is exactly what the bill does. 
I will jump back to the north. 
The bill is not about good corporate citizens. 
It sometimes buried them and sometimes left them exposed. 
What has happened to the sites? 
They have not been cleaned up. 
Corporations have gone through the Faro mine one after the other. 
Who is responsible for that and who is going to end up cleaning it up? 
As it stands, the mess is there.  
That company is out of business. 
Who is going to clean that up? 
Who is going to live with the contamination? 
The Royal Oak mine in the Northwest Territories has gone out of business. 
Who is left with that? 
It is the Canadian citizens. 
What is the definition of cost effective? 
It was very impromptu. 
Members of parliament had the chance to listen to him. 
This is something we cannot do. 
It has become a virtual protection act.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The north is then completely overlooked.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
I share a lot of their concerns around contaminants leaking their way into the north.  
Mr. Speaker, the effects of those pollutants are really insidious. 
They are hard to diagnose. 
What I think this legislation does is it sets a standard. 
By passing the legislation we set that standard. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
When the bill came out of committee it actually had some teeth to it. 
I find this absolutely disgusting.  
My children will one day ask me what I did to stop them. 
Allow me to talk about a few things the government has been doing. 
It is absolutely unbelievable.  
Still nothing has been done to contain or remedy the problem. 
The waste is on a federal government abandoned site.  
No action was taken. 
The Liberals voted against this information. 
Whatever the Liberals do they do not want to upset the polluter. 
To quote Julia Langer, toxicologist for World Wildlife Fund Canada: 
-the regulatory process is deeply flawed. 
The Liberal government says it will spend millions of dollars on research. 
What will the government do with the information when it gets it?  
It is really the best polluter protection legislation in the world.  
They take hundreds of years to grow. 
In a few minutes a dragger will come buy and sweep these things away. 
I plead with the government one last time. 
The environment is us. 
It is everything that we do.  
It is an absolute disgrace.  
Mr. Campbell worked tirelessly on this portfolio day after day, month after month. 
They have formed a great team. 
That is most unfortunate.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
We all care about the environment. 
I have a hypothetical question for him. 
Let us say that the hon. member is chairman of a company. 
Could they force them to find the solution when the solution may not be there? 
What would you say then?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is the seven generation principle, and that is what we should be doing.  
It gives extraordinary powers to the environment minister, he or she. 
We know this one may not be around long after the next shuffle. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
That is a very gentle way to describe it.  
How could he stand here today and say he will do that?  
Why did you do that? 
Did you do it because of what you cared for or did- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Don't forget me.  
The aboriginal group is strictly an advisory group. 
The minister can still chose to ignore its advice. 
Also the bill completely ignores the Metis people.  
She cannot deny that because it is a fact.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
I will focus my remarks on the critical issue of enforcement of the law. 
Inspections serve several functions. 
Second, they can identify specific environmental problems. 
Third, they serve to identify non-compliance for further investigation.  
The steps laid out in the order must be reasonable. 
They must be consistent with protection of the environment and public safety.  
Alternative measures are not new in Canadian law. 
They already are present in the Criminal Code as well as the Young Offenders Act. 
They are negotiated between the accused and the Attorney General of Canada. 
They must also accept the responsibility for their offence.  
EPAMs are not backroom deals. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for her fine speech. 
I have a number of questions for her.  
The indictment was quite scathing. 
Many of the recommendations have been implemented in this bill. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
That is virtual elimination. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
We have to have their buy in to it as well.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I thank the hon. member for his concern. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The government proposed 90 amendments. 
CEPA, the current legislation that is enacted in Canada, came into place in 1988. 
Our thinking about the environment has evolved since then. 
Science and technology have evolved since then. 
The environmental challenges are increasing rather than decreasing.  
After years of debate, a clear framework will exist once this bill is passed. 
Canadian businesses will meet the challenges. 
There are environmental businesses in my riding that depend on strong regulatory frameworks. 
That is what this bill will ensure.  
The bill establishes a clear framework for managing toxic substances. 
It ensures cleaner air and water. 
It deals with federal government lands and operations and aboriginal lands. 
It encourages public participation. 
There is a new environmental register that is fully accessible on the Internet. 
These are good things. 
It will lead to good change in our country.  
It virtually eliminates the most dangerous of those toxic substances. 
This bill is a good bill. 
It was improved in the process and we have maintained that.  
There is an increased role for aboriginal peoples. 
It improves the opportunities for public involvement. 
I would now like to talk a bit about virtual elimination. 
It relates to the most toxic substances. 
We base the decisions on science but we do not require full scientific certainly. 
That is what the legislation ensures.  
Let us talk about gender benders or hormone disrupting substances. 
Some chemicals disrupt the hormones in our bodies. 
Other things might have a longer term effect. 
We are doing research. 
They are part of international panels. 
They are doing the research in my riding of Burlington. 
The bill is about pollution prevention. 
The bill has public input and as a final bill it protects human health. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
He also sits on the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development.  
Everything is a power struggle in that party. 
Mr. Speaker, that was an interesting preamble and an interesting question. 
I will try to ignore that part. 
The bill is not about duplication. 
In some cases they overlap. 
The legitimate use of the criminal law in- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
What does the parliamentary secretary feel about that?  
We recently announced a project the other day. 
We must protect the environment and the human health of Canadians.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The standing committee has been tossed around by the- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member but his time is up.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I will divide the environment into two sections: domestic and international.  
After all, as we know, the environment is transboundary. 
It affects not only ourselves but other countries in the world.  
We need to re-examine that.  
There is the lack of monitoring and the unfulfilled commitments. 
Commitments are made but not adhered to.  
No one is watching them. 
Commitments are made and no concrete action is taken. 
Only 11% of the commitments made by departments have been fulfilled. 
There is a lack of co-ordination among departments and inadequate review is endemic.  
We need to turn talk into action. 
We do not need to reinvent the wheel. 
We can look at what is happening in other countries. 
The World Bank is starting to do it. 
Internationally we have to look at what will happen in the future. 
There is an increasing population growth rate. 
Currently our world population is 6 billion people. 
In the middle of the next century the world population will hit 11 billion. 
People will strive for an improved standard of living.  
This issue affects not only the federal government, but also the provinces. 
Species rely upon land to survive. 
I know there are members across the way who feel very passionately about this. 
There are two topics I would like to broach. 
One is co-ordination between government and the private sector. 
Not enough has been done about that. 
Again I bring up the subject of South Africa. 
It is the last repository for large mammals in that area of the world. 
The government needs to turn talk into action. 
It needs to implement the strategies. 
It needs to monitor the strategies. 
It needs to establish clear targets. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
These individuals are from a well established family. 
I believe it will.  
Unfortunately we have not adopted this in our country. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question.  
The World Bank is starting to institute some fine programs. 
It has been really innovative.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We want to protect the people of our country from being poisoned. 
It happens to be the blue book of the Reform Party. 
Right in the centre is our policy on pollution and the environment. 
I would encourage people to get a copy of this book.  
I am holding it so the camera does not pick it up. 
It is not being used as a prop. 
It is not even as bad as a flag.  
The facts are, what are the policies and principles- 
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I am quite willing to table 301 copies with the clerk. 
Some may want to have it quicker than that. 
It is a wonderful centrefold. 
That is the only responsible statement that can be made on the environment. 
There has to be some reasonable middle ground. 
We need to balance all of these various factors.  
This was at a time when we were bringing in non-leaded fuel.  
I have purchased one or two or three cars over the last 34 years. 
The big car we have now uses exactly half as much fuel. 
It uses 9.4 litres every 100 kilometres.  
It is totally clean burning. 
I feel so good when I do that because I am not polluting the atmosphere.  
I feel that it is a personal responsibility to do whatever we can individually. 
The smoke is being sucked in instead of blown out. 
Let us get real.  
I remember also when catalytic converters came out. 
For part of my trip I had to go on public roads. 
When the catalytic converters came out they choked me. 
My body rejected the pollution coming from that vehicle.  
We must do what we can in order to reduce pollution. 
I recommend that we go to bicycles, every one of us. 
It happened to be a fellow Reformer.  
We talk about it but who uses public transit in order to reduce pollution? 
Each of us likes to get in individual cabs or big limousines and drive around. 
We use these large vehicles one at a time. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
There are industrial processes and others that use chemicals. 
There is a limit to how far one can go.  
Bill C-32 is a step in the right direction. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Could the hon. member comment on that?  
The member is absolutely right when he says that about the Reform Party. 
We are committed to that.  
I talked about my little Mazda. 
I did not replace the spark plugs for 75,000 kilometres. 
That is not sound science. 
I believe in sound science.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is wishful thinking. 
I have not read the pink book. 
Unfortunately I have other duties in committee. 
My understanding of the commissioner is that he is a political appointment. 
I would like to see a totally- 
Shame on the member.  
If I am wrong I want to be corrected. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
This is not a first step. 
The bill certainly is not perfect. 
Many of my communities depend on the forestry and mining sectors. 
We are where we are. 
I encourage my colleagues across the way to support the government in this initiative.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
That is the only criticism I have of the motion. 
What we need is action. 
That is exactly what the bill put forward by the New Democratic Party would do.  
There are those who will wonder whether or not other nations have legislation. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
In Canada there are 14 different jurisdictions covering occupational safety and health. 
Numbers like these are cause for concern for all of us. 
A number of stakeholders and experts will be consulted in this process.  
The last two recommendations deal with corporate accountability.  
This is something that the government has already made a priority. 
The emphasis has been on the prevention of injury and illness. 
The spirit of Motion No. 455 is commendable. 
In reality, safety is a concern to all of us. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I think there is something wrong with that logic.  
The New Democratic Party waited a full six months before it filed a similar bill. 
It is important to get that on the record.  
I would like to explain what happened on that dreadful morning back in May 1992. 
Motion No. 455 reads as follows: 
In short, profitability equals sustainability.  
As stated in Justice Richard's report: 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
The hon. member is an active member of the justice committee. 
I know he is keenly engaged in justice issues. 
It clearly provides for director liability. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
All Canadians know the solemn background to the introduction of this motion. 
The Westray mine disaster claimed the lives of 26 Canadian mine workers. 
It was a very sad event in our history.  
We want to establish lines of accountability. 
That is the intent of the motion we are debating.  
The inquiry asked for the matter of accountability to be studied. 
The motion jumps to Criminal Code amendments. 
This smacks of political opportunism to me.  
We must consider the position of unions. 
What about other government and ministerial responsibilities?  
This is true across Canada. 
Yes we should study our laws and make them stronger if need be.  
They can be obtained quickly, often without advance notice. 
Injunctions allow us to rely on our courts for enforcement power. 
I believe this is what the current motion is trying to obtain.  
Let us look closely at what prosecutions can be pursued. 
I quote from a document: 
In addition, prosecutions do not provide a direct remedy for affected workers.  
This effect may extend beyond that realized by the financial penalty.  
The Liberals stopped the Somalia inquiry dead in its tracks. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
The motion being presented is certainly worthy of note and interesting to consider. 
We know that to be true. 
Certainly it is an important issue that we on the government side share. 
Accordingly the cost to the Canadian economy runs to an estimated $10 billion annually. 
This is easier said than done. 
We need to study this aspect very carefully.  
The code covers a broad range of industries under federal jurisdiction. 
It only covers those who fall under federal jurisdiction.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
In recent years this basic rule of law has been stretched, twisted and manipulated. 
Those individuals should be held accountable for those choices.  
In addition to responsibility equality is a foundation stone of society. 
Is a violation easily healed, a problem easily solved?  
As a parliament we have a responsibility to set the moral course for our government. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Workers are the backbone of our economy. 
The cost of workplace accidents is high. 
The motion proposes that we need a new legislative approach to workplace safety. 
Legislation is clearly one option, but so is education. 
The labour program is very supportive of these activities. 
The second part of the approach, of course, is legislation. 
That is only a small part of the working population in Canada.  
I know this is a contentious area. 
Thus, while I support the idea of a study I do not support the amendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
It goes against the principle of equity. 
I cannot wait for his answer.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The time for rhetoric is past. 
That is why the minister is negotiating so intently. 
It is time to settle. 
Let us turn to the facts for a moment. 
We did not reach an agreement last year with Alaska. 
The minister is encouraged to report that the talks are proceeding well. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We have been looking at this issue at the justice committee. 
He still denies that this is even a fact.  
This is absolutely shocking. 
It will be an absolute disgrace if this is allowed to happen.  
Yet this is the type of language that very clearly sets out this insidious plan.  
Yet this plan is hatched in a very secretive way.  
This is an extremely dangerous initiative. 
There is absolutely no doubt that this plan was afoot. 
We know it was happening. 
Thankfully, through the diligence of the opposition, we have exposed it. 
We do not want to see it proceeding any further.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
He has put his question to the current solicitor general and his predecessor. 
Mr. Jacques Saada: -if he allows me to speak.  
For the public, I would explain just what is happening.  
All this effort is based on very solid programs, which are science based. 
The programs are not extemporaneous.  
There are no quotas. 
There have never been quotas. 
There will never be quotas. 
He does not have exclusive prerogative on public safety.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Technology was advancing rapidly and North American factories were booming. 
We now know that such careless activity can ruin our beautiful planet.  
This is obviously very important for future generations.  
Canadians think this is an important issue. 
We must continue to improve and modernize the methods we use.  
It is a necessity for human life. 
We need to use this kind of approach in the environmental area again.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It is consistent with our international trade obligations. 
Progress on that federal strategy has been significant.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
These negotiations will be important. 
Canada is a very open economy. 
It is a trading nation unlike many others. 
Canadians are very knowledgeable in this area.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we welcome the remarks of the member for Toronto Centre-Rosedale. 
He has done his utmost to involve Canadians and to seek their advice. 
The minister certainly wants to encourage his continuing to do that in the future.  
At a minimum it will address the agriculture and service sectors. 
These are sectors are very important to the Canadian economy.  
Consultations are well underway. 
Two of our standing committees are involved. 
In addition, on February 17- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but time has expired.  
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The link between the environment and human health are well proven. 
Point by point and clause by clause, improvements were made to the legislation. 
The first point was the loss of the phase-out consideration. 
Only the virtual elimination of toxics substances is offered.  
Virtual is not appreciated.  
The second point was that Canadians had lost the basic essence of the precautionary principle. 
It has watered down the environmental standards in Canada.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Children's health comes first. 
Let us get some facts straight about what Bill C-32 really does.  
The bill places new deadlines for taking action where we identify concerns. 
It provides us with the authority to virtually eliminate the most dangerous toxic substances.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.22 p.m.)
