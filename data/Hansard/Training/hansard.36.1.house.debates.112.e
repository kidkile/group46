EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 112 
Monday, June 1, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
It was the Children's Miracle Network telethon. 
But, in essence, they were all trying to do a good thing. 
They will get a tax credit for doing that. 
We support that in our tax system.  
That is why this motion reads: 
I will not claim this as an original idea of mine. 
The government chose not to implement that recommendation in 1996. 
However, the time has come. 
That other debate is a good debate for another session.  
Today I will argue two points in relation to M-318. 
In innumerable ways charities help society.  
They have not asked the government to provide a program. 
They have said they will do it. 
They just want the flexibility to be able to direct the money. 
They do this in a variety of ways. 
Those moves which the government has made have been good moves. 
This indicates the government's acknowledgement that charities do good work in Canada. 
We should encourage charitable work. 
That is not a bad thing; that is a good thing. 
That could be a very good thing. 
Motion No. 318 provides one of those tools. 
It is an excellent tool to generate greater giving to charities. 
Where does the government stand on this issue? 
I will be interested to hear from the government side during this debate. 
This is exactly the motion I brought forward today.  
Where do the charities stand on this issue? 
What would they think of this? 
In November 1995 the president and CEO of the Canadian Centre for Philanthropy said: 
Again it is exactly what this motion proposes. 
Why has the government ignored it to date? 
I touched on it briefly. 
It felt the budget just did not allow it to do that.  
That is much needed. 
That is an option.  
I will go through a couple of options. 
That would cost the government $190 million a year. 
It is no small amount of money. 
Again it is a significant amount of money.  
Canadians are a very generous group of people. 
They are small givers. 
Charities rely on those small donations to make ends meet. 
That is their bread and butter. 
They rely on those small donations. 
The government can choose one of these options. 
Perhaps the government has some ideas of its own. 
I would be interested to hear that.  
It would also make the system more efficient. 
I do not belittle the work of political parties. 
They serve a purpose in society. 
I am part of one and I will continue to be. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The current tax regime was put in place in consultation with the charitable organizations. 
It has made a difference''.  
This announcement is clearly good news for communities.  
Canadians donate in the smaller increments because they want to.  
That is the basic difference between the two. 
For the reasons outlined we cannot support the motion. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Charitable organizations operate in a variety of sectors. 
Speaking of donors, I would like to mention some telling statistics.  
My colleagues from the Bloc and I will vote in favour of the motion.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
We simply do not have the local tax base. 
That is why this motion is very important. 
They are very important, particularly in the context of an aging population. 
The guiding principle behind tax reform should be tax simplification.  
In fact, all Canadians would benefit from such a change. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to debate this motion. 
Charities themselves would receive little benefit.  
I share the principle of charitable giving. 
This goal is a chance we give as well to the people in developing nations. 
Charitable donations are more than a contribution. 
Charitable contributions are gifts to help advance the noble causes of the heart. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I certainly applaud his initiative to bring this matter forward.  
That is a key phrase in the motion itself. 
The motion very clearly says no less than.  
He said to look at alternatives.  
That is the issue. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
ALLOTTED DAY-UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We saw the public condemn that statement.  
We now have the proof we needed. 
There is no such separate account. 
The government used the money to reduce the deficit. 
Among other things, these studies addressed the consequences on long term employment. 
Those choices were deliberate. 
It compared two groups: that of 1993 and that of 1995. 
It was the GST all over again.  
That is why people are angry today. 
These young people have no other way of qualifying. 
The time has now come to re-assess the EI policy. 
I think the judgment that was passed reflects the reality. 
Given the situation, the federal government must quickly go back to the drawing board. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Young people are indeed greatly affected. 
Three out of every four are no longer eligible for benefits. 
There is a new reality, but there is also a solution.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is no consent.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois has made this whole issue its priority. 
The motion of the hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques reads: 
The government is not honest with the people. 
That is what we have been denouncing for over a year. 
In Le Soleil , Donald Charest wrote ``This is a fictitious surplus''. 
It has been used to pay the government's grocery bill, its deficit.  
The government will be in a jam in the event of a recession. 
They were reduced by only 20 cents. 
This is especially true for part time workers.  
Consequently, they receive even less benefits than before.  
At present, the government gets another $700,000 every hour. 
Each and every hour, $700,000 more comes into the government's coffers. 
This is something to be severely criticized.  
I am glad much was made of this last week. 
He is very polite, but he is not very quick to act.  
The minister does not want to rush into any hasty decisions. 
I understand, it is worth his while not to. 
This means $2.5 billion downloaded onto the provinces.  
And then there are women. 
The minister gives us simplistic answers. 
He does not even have statistics to back them up. 
He tells us it is due to the birth rate. 
The discrepancy is obvious.  
But obviously the government has no intention of backing off.  
The people will judge it on its accomplishments. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Poverty insurance will particularly affect one category of workers, pregnant women. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her question. 
Indeed the minister's statement is shameful. 
He is telling us that we are richer because the deficit has been eliminated.  
We know now where the money that was used to eliminate the deficit came from. 
Women are also very affected by this reform. 
There has been a substantial decrease in these benefits in 1997. 
I do not know what his answer will be. 
He will certainly come up with another farfetched answer.  
This will definitely not encourage young couples to have children. 
Those are the things that we denounce.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
That is not the case at all. 
Employment insurance rewards people who work. 
It invests in people who are prepared to invest in themselves. 
In 1996-97 this measure helped some 9,000 individuals.  
For those with an entrepreneurial spirit we provide self-employment assistance. 
The fifth active re-employment measure is called skills, loans and grants. 
I can assure the hon. member that the effects will not be disastrous. 
No one can accuse this government of short changing Quebeckers. 
They are causing the loss of jobs. 
With all due respect, the member is wrong again. 
They say it is not adaptable to the labour market. 
That is being adaptable and that is looking to the future.  
No, they are not. 
I should think not, but their speeches lead me to believe otherwise. 
That is certainly not what the Government of Canada wants.  
What about seasonal workers? 
Employment insurance is there for seasonal workers. 
That is what created dependency on unemployment insurance. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague has criticized my talking about a scandal.  
After the bill, the number of weeks was reduced to 20. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
He is interested in raising fears and talking about disaster. 
Those are measures designed to get people back to work and into the labour force.  
They are raising unemployment.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question will be very brief. 
What exactly has happened to that $15 billion fund? 
I think workers and employers would like to know that it is stored away safely.  
We see it as an investment. 
As a result, premiums were going up under the former Tory administration. 
That is good management by this government. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
All the others were cut off employment insurance, because of the government.  
I will close on this question. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I wish to address the aspect of the EI fund.  
The EI fund is a myth. 
The EI fund does not exist in any real way. 
There is no fund. 
It is a fairy tale. 
It never has existed.  
We just need a little money to get it out of the ground. 
Pretty soon it will all come back to you''.  
It does not exist. 
A $15 billion IOU.  
There is no money in there. 
People who have been paying into it for years and years have been misled. 
We see it as well in things like the Canada pension plan. 
We see it happening with the federal superannuation pension fund.  
This is another example of that.  
Where did the $15 billion go? 
Maybe it went to Italy. 
We do not know.  
All we know is that it went into the consolidated revenue fund. 
I would argue this is wrong headed. 
Why do we not take this fund off budget? 
My friends would say that in the past the government has honoured its IOUs. 
We would have to start running deficits once again. 
That is the effect of not putting that money aside.  
Who would pay to get out of that deficit hole again? 
We would see workers and employers paying twice to get out of the soup.  
That would be a much better plan.  
There is another issue associated with this. 
The other day the finance minister was before the finance committee. 
Regrettably I was unable to be there. 
I found that very strange. 
Which way is it? 
The government should make up its mind. 
One day it will create jobs, the next day it will not create jobs. 
Canadians want to see some cuts to EI premiums. 
I think they have made that very clear. 
We ran in the election campaign on lowering EI premiums. 
That is clearly not the case. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The member wants to know whether there is such a thing as an EI account. 
The government is on target to reduce premiums more this year. 
I want the member to be aware of two things.  
There is an independent commission that does review it. 
It has representatives of labour and employers. 
The member was incorrect in that. 
Which is the new Reform Party's position on this issue?  
It did displace eight Liberals in the west in the last election. 
That was part of our election platform in the 1997 election. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He cannot have it both ways. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend across the way for the question.  
My friend knows it. 
It is the actual account itself, the money in it, that is the myth. 
My friend suggested there are various types of programs. 
I think he called them partnerships and strategies. 
We know in Atlantic Canada we have unemployment in some cases of 20%.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
That was not mentioned.  
That is the reality in my riding.  
He has always declined. 
Overly tough EI eligibility criteria have driven thousands of workers into poverty. 
He has no claim on it whatsoever.  
They must see what is really going on in the country. 
We have a job problem. 
This is not what they said. 
They say we must not scare people. 
But this is what goes on in our ridings.  
This is absolutely shameful.  
How can the hon. member claim that this is a good program?  
This is truly shameful. 
Their problems are the same. 
Nobody is begging not to work.  
How dare it say things like that?  
These demonstrations did occur. 
I keep talking about jobs every day. 
I will never do so. 
The Liberals do not even deserve to be here. 
This is what they have done. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
He described what life is really for the people in theirs regions. 
That is not the case. 
Who signed this letter? 
The current Prime Minister of Canada. 
All workers understood the need for this kind of solidarity.  
He sounded like the current Prime Minister.  
They get $165 a week before taxes, which amounts to $135. 
He should be ashamed to be in this House.  
Doug Young cut UI and he was shown the door. 
That is what the Liberals did. 
That is what they are bragging about.  
That is what we were left with.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
The motion before the House today is very important for the regions affected. 
My motion was defeated by six votes to five. 
It was very close. 
On the government side there are also some concerns. 
That is why they elected us.  
I think it was very clear. 
They elected mostly Tories in New Brunswick. 
There are not very many Liberals I do not think. 
We have to come up with a strategy. 
One of the problems is that there are barriers to job creation.  
EI premiums are a tax on jobs. 
We have been asking questions of the finance minister since day one. 
We called the Liberals pickpockets. 
It was not considered unparliamentary after it was analysed. 
In some regions of Canada they are on welfare. 
In order to get a good education one has to have money. 
These people are behind the eight-ball and will be there for a while.  
We have been saying that since day one. 
In that happy economy is some facts he chooses not to mention. 
I will mention a few he does not wish to mention.  
Per capita personal income is down after inflation and taxes are taken into account. 
We do not hear anything about that. 
Canadians are saving less of their take home pay while taking on more debt. 
Once again, we do not hear the government bragging about that.  
It is a broken record. 
It is certainly not helping today's citizens. 
It would not do anything. 
It is certainly not creative.  
We have not heard about that. 
We do not hear the Minister of Finance stating that. 
Some 85,000 Canadians declared personal bankruptcy last year. 
Canadians want to work. 
They do not want EI. 
We have seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada. 
The reform to the Employment Insurance Act is certainly not providing for them. 
I wonder how government members would feel fishing on top of six feet of ice. 
These people have to be protected. 
These people have to be protected. 
There seems to be nothing there for them at all but hardship.  
Young people also are hurt by the employment insurance and by unemployment. 
Their jobless rate is twice the national average. 
It is truly incredible.  
This is also why I moved that motion then.  
In my riding there is an association called Future Street People. 
Can you believe this, future street people. 
In the meantime, we must protect people in need.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
The Prime Minister is totally disconnected from the reality in Canada and in Quebec. 
We all know his position about the millennium scholarships fund. 
We know it is an unprecedented violation of an exclusive area of provincial jurisdiction.  
Because the Prime Minister had ordered them to do so. 
They were forced to vote against their own conscience.  
And what about his reforms to employment insurance? 
I say ``his reforms'', because every decision is made by his own office. 
That is possibly what the Liberals call the new youth employment strategy.  
Nice way to promote the family.  
I have tried to find something positive in this reform. 
I have looked again and again, but I have not found anything yet.  
Let us take, for example, my riding of Lotbiniere. 
Try explaining that to the unemployed. 
It is sheer nonsense.  
Even the minister is no longer answering the information requests of local citizens. 
What is he waiting for? 
That is the Liberal priority.  
This approach is unfair and infringes on people's freedom.  
As if posters could talk.  
To Victoriaville, where everything has been centralized for the summer season. 
This is yet another nice way to get closer to the local people.  
Where are the millions of dollars missing? 
This department is a shambles.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
In Quebec they get more money than they put into the system.  
The other question deals with the active measures, part two. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
What would the member have against those two moves? 
What exactly does he have against those two ideas?  
The money is collected from taxpayers living in all of the provinces of Canada. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My hon. colleague from Acadie-Bathurst defeated him.  
Go tell these cynics that it is not true. 
They are no more worthy than the finance minister''.  
He was laughing at the results of his policy. 
He was proudly boasting about his accomplishments as Minister of Finance.  
That is why there is no money left in that fund. 
At the end of the current fiscal year, he will have stolen $19 billion. 
What is going on with regard to employment insurance? 
What is going on with regard to the job market? 
These are general figures. 
It can happen to anybody.  
He laughs at people right under their noses. 
He is cynical and sarcastic, as we saw this morning. 
He is laughing at us. 
The finance minister was laughing this morning, and his colleagues too. 
They find this very funny.  
I did not get any answer. 
I will ask my question again today. 
The finance minister did not bother answering me. 
Poverty has been on the rise for five years''. 
I should say so. There are more poor children than before. 
There is no need to be a rocket scientist to know why. 
There are more unemployed people than before''.  
Such cynicism cannot go unchallenged.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
That is why we have tried to make improvements to the system. 
Is he suggesting that we take them out of the system? 
Two hundred and seventy thousand women benefit by that section of the legislation. 
The Liberals are laughing in our face.  
It being almost 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
The Forest Capital Award is especially significant for the year 2000. 
Canada has much to celebrate.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That is not the only award the Fraser Valley has been winning lately.  
SYDENHAM RIVER CLEAN-UP 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Together they are improving the safety of the river. 
Their hard work and enthusiasm are to be commended.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
But as the Prime Minister said, much remains to be done. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
The so-called Windsor-St. 
Let me tell say that the good voters of Windsor-St. 
The real grassroots in Windsor-St. 
Clair do not even support Reform. 
They vote for real representation in the House by voting Liberal.  
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Canadians considered the Reform alternative in the last election and they turned thumbs down.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
One of these was a constituent of mine, Mr. William R. Gibson.  
These veterans are not getting any younger. 
The German government has already made similar reparations to Britain. 
These veterans deserve justice today. 
Over half a century is an obscene amount of time to wait. 
Justice delayed is justice denied.  
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
The only people interested in this political party are the Bloc Quebecois. 
Now the Reformers are looking at them as possible allies.  
It is the separatists who will welcome this shift. 
I can hardly wait to hear the new Sovereignist-Reform party line. 
As a third way, it is pretty sad.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
This government has no plan to protect Canada's biodiversity. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Her endless round of work complete, 
madame was much dismayed 
when, on retirement, it appeared 
that she would not get paid. 
The new reform, so brightly wrapped, 
ignored all she had done, 
of payments there were none. 
``Is no allowance made?  
and others would need aid''. 
The man who held the purse strings said 
You never drew a pay cheque, so 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Join Reform's united- 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There was absolutely no one else who could do something of this particular magnitude.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this contract is unique all right. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Again, the government will be saving a lot of- 
I would appeal to you to be a little more considerate.  
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is wrong on both counts. 
Whose decision was it to bend the rules in favour of Bombardier? 
Was it the minister responsible or was it the Prime Minister himself?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all there was no bending of the rules. 
It is not just Bombardier. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is wrong again. 
He is listing subcontractors and we are talking about the prime contractor.  
This is his department and his regulations were broken.  
We ask the question again. 
Whose decision was it to bypass the rules? 
Was it the decision of the minister or the Prime Minister?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Otherwise we would have lost the opportunity. 
We would have had to close the base. 
We have saved those jobs. 
It will amount to a saving of $200 million over 20 years.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Now I will ask for the fourth time:
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there are two sources of funding involved. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister's answer is far from satisfactory. 
I will give the minister another chance.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What is it going to be?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
As to the rest, the member would have us put the cart before the horse. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, there is a powder keg smouldering in south Asia right now. 
Team Canada went to China to make money. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the premise of the hon. member's question. 
Canadian foreign policy is not for sale.  
We have strongly condemned the most recent Pakistani nuclear tests. 
We are clearly acting together with our allies on this important matter.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Who decided to bypass all the competition rules? 
Was it the public works minister or was it the Prime Minister?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There happened to be some slightly used ones available.  
Every case has to be examined on its merits. 
There was really no other choice.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Who made the decision to bend the rules? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
What are the differences? 
Why is he complaining about that? 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is much more interesting for Canadians than a cheque every two weeks.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Why does he not rule out the status quo this very day?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
They are together right now examining the options. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will take a close look at the situation. 
I can assure you that we will give due consideration to this matter.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The cost was $10,000.  
I would like to ask the junior foreign affairs minister this question. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Now let us come to the substance of the issue. 
His assignment was to prepare the diplomatic conference.  
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
This morning, the students of Quebec vehemently denounced the millennium scholarship project. 
They announced a series of actions that will take place to block the project. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
It is a top priority of this government to act on child labour. 
We would like to have it.  
We have held consultations with other governments on child labour. 
We adopted legislation on sex tourism. 
We participated in the Oslo child labour conference. 
It is our agenda that was adopted.  
HRDC has hosted a conference with NAFTA partners. 
CIDA has adopted a strategy for children. 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Is it invested somewhere? 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is in the consolidated revenue fund.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
The hon. member has to come clean. 
Is he going to cut it out of transfers to the provinces? 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Seventeen billion dollars is a lot of money. 
Why is this government refusing to help unemployed workers facing hard times? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
On the contrary, what we want is for Canadian workers- 
Dear colleagues, I am sure that we all want to hear the answer. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Pakistan has China to thank for making this possible.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Unfortunately to date India has not been willing to accept Canadian mediation.  
I think we are acting effectively and we will continue to do so. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
On which occasion was the finance minister telling the truth?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This is a result of the measures we have put into force. 
We are the first member of the G-7 to eliminate its deficit. 
We are now paying down our debt. 
We had a gross rate in the first quarter of- 
The hon. member for Levis.  
SPIRIT OF COLUMBUS PLATFORM 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I met with ministers from Quebec on this issue. 
Both came up with a single plan. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The pay equity tribunal ruling is expected in July. 
Already 10 of the groups have accepted to negotiate and have concluded negotiations. 
The hon. member for Fundy-Royal.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Why is this minister allowing the government to deliberately abandon environment at the cabinet table?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this government has not abandoned the environment agenda. 
It is very important to us.  
I am very concerned, as is the government, about climate change. 
We want to protect our nature.  
I will be bringing in regulations this fall to do with sulphur in gasoline.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
The bill is intended to extend such benefits to bicycle couriers.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present two petitions today. 
The first concerns police officers and firefighters.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition has to do with the family.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my honour today to present three petitions.  
The second petition is also with respect to highways. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the final petition contains 36 signatures from residents of Saskatchewan. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
The second petition is on exactly the same subject, the same motion. 
It is signed by 125 petitioners who present it to parliament for its consideration.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Question No. 21 was asked on October 3, 1997. 
It is a long time to wait for an answer to a question. 
I asked the question last week. 
Will we get the answer before the break? 
Could the parliamentary secretary answer?  
Mr. Speaker, the member is quite right. 
I know he has been following Question No. 21 very closely.  
That is what is taking the time. 
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
ALLOTTED DAY-UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I am pleased to rise today to speak to the motion before us. 
Lately it has become obvious that the Bloc is living in the past. 
We have no interest in going back. 
The old EI system was in need of total overhaul. 
It was totally focused on passive income support. 
It did nothing to help unemployed Canadians move toward work.  
Since 1993, over 1.2 million new jobs have been created in Canada. 
The unemployment rate is at its lowest in nearly eight years. 
Now, for the first time, all part time workers are covered under the plan. 
Unemployment insurance was a passive income support system. 
We also felt that unemployment insurance encouraged dependence. 
Her business, Excellent Secretarial Services, is doing very well indeed.  
Around 270,000 women are now eligible for employment insurance for the first time.  
We are more ambitious than the Bloc members. 
It is their only goal.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
He was bragging about the new eligibility criteria. 
He was quoting statistics.  
After waiting several weeks she finally received her cards to fill out. 
She did not have enough hours. 
This woman is not alone. 
It is especially true when those individuals are ineligible to collect benefits. 
We already have the highest tax in the G-7.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
He gave us the example of a woman from Sydney.  
I will try to be brief. 
Why can he not consider restoring some fairness in the system?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like all Canadians to take note that the fund-- 
I think the hon. member is rising on a point of debate. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
We do not have to choose between economics and people. 
Societal development goes hand in hand with economic development. 
They want the chance to acquire new skills and advance their education. 
We must enable them to achieve their dreams.  
They would have us return to the days of passive income support. 
They would deny individuals the opportunity to upgrade their skills and make themselves more employable.  
The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in almost eight years. 
Since the beginning of 1997 543,000 jobs have been created in Canada.  
The federal government will continue to look after the interests of all Canadians.  
Let us work together to help Canadians get back to work.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Up to this date, close to $16 billion have been collected in indirect taxes. 
There is not even any provision for it in the government's books. 
Perhaps my colleague could answer the following. 
What is his answer to his constituents?  
I think Canadians across the country understand that and respect it.  
The hon. member talks about being in the past. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Now they are in power. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member opposite for the question.  
It really has no financial credibility. 
The people are not fooled by such nonsense. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
This is the reality of the workforce for several of them.  
This is what I could call an employment insurance welcome tax. 
Is this not a situation that should be of concern?  
This is quite a gift from the Liberal government to our young people. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
My colleague referred to the insensitivity of the minister and of the Liberal members.  
This is another ill-conceived notion of the present. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for asking me such an important question.  
They do not qualify for employment insurance or for welfare. 
My area has the highest rate of unemployment in Canada. 
It is nothing to be proud of. 
At the end of the day, their employment insurance cheque will not amount to much.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will give a brief historic overview. 
That pretty much describes our seasonal jobs.  
It is not something we want to be known for.  
Only one in two jobless people is eligible.  
I am talking about relaxing the eligibility criteria.  
Strike 1 for the minister.  
Not money that has already been committed, but money that is left to be spent. 
Is there any money left, yes or no?  
The worst part is that they are thumbing their noses at us in this House.  
He misled the House three times, and that has to be rectified.  
This is totally unacceptable.  
I have to interrupt the member. 
He knows my knowledge of the French language is not perfect. 
He said that the minister has misled the House.  
I hope the member will do this immediately.  
I have pointed out three statements in the minister's remarks that are incorrect. 
They harbour different views. 
There are differences like that all the time. 
These measures will have troubling repercussions, because they discourage workers''. 
He was still talking about the Conservatives. 
The signature is that of the member for Shawinigan.  
On the eve of election 
He'll call you his son 
The following day, a hundred to one 
Your name he will shun 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
In the Gaspe and the Acadian peninsulas, the problem is about the same.  
I would like to know what he thinks about this.  
I note, with my friend from Acadie-Bathurst, that this is deplorable. 
The sun still rises in the east.  
But what do we do with the fisher after that? 
Do we send him to Montreal on a computer course? 
If he became a good computer programmer, would he ever return to lobster fishing?  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today. 
We see this in its motion. 
With more investment by business we get more jobs. 
Both those plants will be making products for the world. 
That on the face of it suggests a problem. 
They thought that sick benefits needed to be looked at. 
Right now the length of the term for people on sick benefits is 15 weeks. 
Older workers would also fit within this category. 
Another issue that comes up is the whole issue of dropping the EI premium rate. 
The premium rate has to come down in a gradual and measured way. 
We all have to admit that the economy goes up and down. 
This is the second largest reduction since the 1970s. 
Let me tell the House what is a catastrophe.  
It was a social program that was fundamentally unsustainable and cried out for reform. 
In effect the program acted as a destabilizer rather than an economic stabilizer. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
By the time they got there and returned it, it was full of IOUs.  
The analogy I think is pretty good, ``Dumb and Dumber''.  
The member talks about how well the economy is doing. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted with the question that the hon. member has asked me. 
I suggest that any understanding of basic economics would provide the answer.  
We provide more generous social programs. 
They all have jobs, my friend is shouting across the way. 
He would have seen that they do not all have jobs. 
A number of people are homeless. 
A number of people are suffering. 
There is an underclass in the United States which does not exist in this country. 
Because we have more generous social programs. 
They know there is a social program to take care of them for a while. 
We are not prepared to tolerate a permanent underclass.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am going to strive mightily to focus my remarks through you. 
I find what is going on here to be quite remarkable. 
This is an attack on our success. 
Attack the workers and the poor.  
Listen to the member from the NDP. 
This is really an attack on the success of this government. 
How can we possibly be running a surplus when we have been reducing premiums? 
How does it work? 
I think the equation is simple. 
There has been a successful reform of unemployment insurance to make it employment insurance.  
I do not really consider employment insurance to be a social program. 
I know it is referred to as that. 
The NDP, of course, would say that we should just jack up the premiums. 
We all know that. 
But I do not consider it to be a social program. 
Welfare is a social program and an important one for people who need that assistance.  
There is a premium and for that there is coverage. 
It is more of a business plan.  
It is not done to the extent that the NDP would do it. 
The NDP would just give everything away.  
The wording is outrageous. 
It tries to say that it is catastrophic. 
I was sitting here thinking about Bloc members. 
Why are they here? 
Why are they in this place? 
It is really quite amazing. 
They are here to tear the country apart. 
The Americans are pretty straightforward. 
It is pretty clear to them that they would not allow that in their government. 
They would not allow that in their democracy.  
How could we possibly get more democratic than that? 
That is their agenda. 
Maybe that is the game. 
It is truly amazing.  
They say there is no surplus. 
What did they say when there was a deficit? 
It was real then.  
Again I use the analogy of ``Dumb and Dumber''. 
I will be anxiously awaiting the release of that wonderful new movie. 
Fact number three: $2 billion is available to the provinces.  
You cannot flip-flop and have it either way.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I wish the hon. member would not continually hassle us with that.  
Is he suggesting that they too are separatists? 
Mr. Harris could be called an anarchist, perhaps, not a separatist.  
To respond to the member, the final point that I could not make does respond. 
That 10th and final point is very important.  
That is absolutely outrageous.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
One Liberal member had to give her resignation and came back after an election.  
If he wanted to get elected in 1993 he would change all that. 
That is how the government got rid of the deficit and balanced the budget. 
They are proud of that? 
They should be ashamed of themselves.  
I could show some catastrophes there. 
That is their solution, spend more.  
It does not work anymore; a new reality. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
It is another lesson in what is happening with the EI fund. 
People are probably asking themselves where it is going.  
It is not actually being set up in an EI fund. 
Remember that Canada pension plan increase people are all feeling now. 
It is all really part of a tax grab. 
Really it is amounting to a percentage tax on their income.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Therefore it is double the amount.  
In these cases it is a simple matter of a tax. 
There is no linkage whatsoever to their employability.  
It is as mythical as unicorns. 
It is as mythical as leprechauns, as mythical as that pot of gold. 
This is a pot of gold that the finance minister is hoarding. 
As a matter of fact, it is not. 
There is no fund. 
It does not exist. 
It is all being rolled in through general revenue.  
I do not know if we buy that. 
He said they were a cancer on jobs. 
He said that payroll taxes kill jobs. 
Now he sings a different tune. 
Why does the government not come clean and make proper priorities? 
There are still profitable companies receiving grants and subsidies. 
Yet it is going ahead and sapping this money out of jobs.  
Some economists had some things to say about this. 
It is not just economists who are crying out about this. 
Some of the premiers have problems with this. 
Premier MacLellan of Nova Scotia has problems with this.  
That is right, a Liberal. 
My goodness, imagine a fellow Liberal criticizing the EI situation. 
I think many of the Liberals are elected in the province of Ontario.  
Does the finance minister remember that?  
It is starting to add up.  
How could anyone go against all these sources? 
It is not just all these people. 
Alberta paid $1.86 billion into EI in 1997. 
Members are probably asking how much Alberta took out. 
It was $670 million. 
The labour force in Alberta comprises 1.513 million people. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid it is already too late. 
There are only seven minutes left in your speech. 
You should have told the Chair about it before.  
We will never see it coming back. 
A lot of students will never be able to draw on it whatsoever. 
A lot of self-employed people will never be able to draw on it.  
It just will not happen. 
What will this actually amount to? 
In Alberta, as I said, it was as much as $786 a year. 
Shame on the finance minister for these types of numbers.  
How can we argue with all the opposition parties and the unions? 
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business is arguing on behalf of job creators, the companies. 
How can we possibly ignore that?  
How could he do that? 
I do not know how he justifies it?  
I would like to bring home a little story from Alberta. 
It is pertinent in this case. 
He got some agreement on that. 
It was not just the premier who was saying it. 
The representative of the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, Dan McLennan, said: 
Certainly, we feel that the federal government could do a better job with EI- 
It is not just Bob White with the Canada Labour Congress. 
Let me run through the list one more time:
I do not know how the government can possibly justify any of these things. 
It does not make any sense.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I never heard so much rubbish in my entire life. 
What is it that they are asking? 
If we were to do this our government would not be able to function. 
Society as a whole could not function.  
What a depressing approach these guys have come up with. 
It is absolutely terrible.  
They are telling us that we should not do that:
If that is the case he had better not stand up at all.  
I am going to put him down as questionable here.  
Mr. Speaker, I will tell the House what taxpayers expect. 
They expect they will get that money back. 
I can talk about regressive mathematics. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I am intrigued with this idea of the surplus. 
They keep saying that we have to have this surplus.  
I am not terribly good at math. 
There is no answering for it at all.  
I would like my colleague to comment on that. 
We would like to rationalize employment insurance funds and personalize them. 
Again I have done a few calculations. 
Mr. Speaker, those are some good ideas. 
I think some of those ideas should be considered.  
I think those ideas are bang on. 
I wish we could make the changes necessary to do that.  
I hope they give those ideas consideration. 
Money right now is going toward employment insurance. 
Students and some self-employed Canadians have no ability to collect on the fund. 
Would that not be impressive?  
They brag about the benefits of that plan.  
I did not mean that he was questionable. 
I meant that he was questioning some of the statements made. 
I hope he will accept my apologies 
We will now hear from the member for Bourassa. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Oak Ridges.  
The employment insurance system is not only compassionate, it is also well thought out. 
The new system provides better support than did the old one.  
In his motion, the hon. member claims that employment insurance treats women unfairly. 
I do not know where he got this idea. 
The system is far from unfair to women, quite the contrary.  
The hon. member is worrying about the impact of employment insurance on young people. 
Is that what the hon. member wants? 
I am sure his constituents will be happy to hear that. 
We will not do that.  
We look toward the future and the future has already begun. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
They proposed a welfare reform based on need. 
This is what we have done in fact.  
The important thing is for people to get back into the workforce. 
I do not want a society that relies solely and constantly on these benefits. 
It is clear that they are totally out of touch with reality. 
This is not what Quebeckers want. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague talks about people who are out of touch with reality.  
What happened to the hon. member's Prime Minister? 
Can he explain this to me, without looking for all kinds of excuses? 
Let him tell the truth. 
What happened to the hon. member's Prime Minister?  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's debate. 
We have improved tax assistance for the disabled and for charities. 
We have placed a high priority on improving Canadian health care.  
First, we remain committed to responsible management of the nation's finances. 
This is simply not the case.  
Look at what else has been happening. 
Clearly we must avoid that at all costs.  
I will return once more to the word balanced. 
For 1998 alone, we cut premiums by $1.4 billion. 
I do not think that is what Canadians want.  
Let me provide the House with three important facts on which to reflect. 
I do not believe this is the case.  
We have regained control of our fiscal future. 
I believe we have taken a balanced approach on this issue.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
My colleague said that the government is taking credit for a balanced budget. 
My hon. colleague would like me to name them. 
That is not a concrete plan for debt repayment. 
The debt has not been decreased as my hon. colleague may have alluded to.  
I would also like to ask my colleague about the $15 billion surplus. 
I think we are demonstrating that we are doing it better. 
Of course it was a partnership. 
I think the approach we have taken is the correct one.  
The hon. member for Saint-Jean. 
Is he going to share his time?  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Yet the Minister of Finance 
The current Prime Minister is the one who said that back then.  
What about now? The basic problem is not being addressed. 
Instead the unemployed are being hit hard. 
How was it achieved? 
Exactly the opposite of what the former opposition leader used to say.  
I will read some more of the letter: 
These measures fill Liberals with consternation.  
Where is their consternation today? 
What happened to their consternation? 
Instead of dealing with the root of the problem, the government goes after the unemployed. 
I find absolutely deplorable all the remarks I have heard there this afternoon. 
It should govern itself accordingly today. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Back home, it does not deter young people from working. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Acadie-Bathurst for his question. 
He mentions a problem that is indeed omnipresent.  
That includes transfers for health, social assistance services and post-secondary education.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
It is still employment insurance.  
Mr. Speaker, I am glad my colleague raised this question. 
What we have here is an indirect tax. 
I think my colleague has made an excellent suggestion. 
A trust account is indeed what we need.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
I will reread the major elements: 
-castigate the government for the catastrophic effects of its reforms to unemployment insurance- 
-for having taken over funds destined for unemployed persons- 
-particularly where young people, women, and self-employed persons are concerned.  
What does the Bloc Quebecois say? 
We say that the government can have a surplus to cover the unforeseen. 
It is like a bottomless pit.  
Above $39,000, workers no longer pay EI premiums. 
What is the finance minister doing? 
This is out of the ordinary.  
The second element is that businesses are paying. 
But what he is saying? 
This is redistributing poverty, to a certain extent. 
I would be inclined to say this makes no political sense.  
This makes no sense at all.  
They do not contribute. 
They benefit from the overall tax reduction, but they do not contribute.  
Big corporations with their huge profits are not contributing either. 
This is even borderline illegal. 
The finance minister says ``Our clients are the underprivileged''. 
Under this government, Canada will have the worst of both worlds.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Clearly her heart is with the unemployed. 
I wish she could continue. 
I would ask the hon. member to continue on this.  
That is not all. 
The reform has surprised a lot of people, particularly many workers in new sectors. 
Now, for such cases, there is no weekly ceiling. 
This comes pretty close to being illegal. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Who was making the payments for that deficit account? 
It was clearly the Government of Canada. 
EI is one of those programs.  
An hon. member: $3.30.  
The parliamentary secretary points out that it was $3.30.  
Yes, that is what it was suggesting. 
What would it have done with EI? 
I recall the debate. 
Mr. Speaker, you were involved in that debate, so you can certainly recall it too. 
They have totally reversed themselves.  
I have been in the House for three years watching the Reform in opposition. 
That was what the the finance minister said. 
We had to set reasonable targets. 
We had to look at each program and deal with each program. 
We had to move the agenda ahead in a proper and orderly way.  
That is exactly what we are doing with the EI program. 
We are guarding against the potential of difficult times in the future.  
They are in the House today, these Reformers who were the Tories. 
There is no question about that. 
Don't call them Tories''. 
He wants the old Conservative Party- 
The hon. member is an experienced member. 
I would invite him to do that.  
I have some problems with that. 
There is good reason that has occurred.  
Clearly he is working. 
He is getting input from people right across this country on a regular basis.  
Stability is really the key.  
Our finance minister has brought stability to this country. 
That is what I am hearing now. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Quite frankly, they have spoken all day. 
They have had all kinds of speakers up. 
Let us look at where we are with our EI reforms. 
EI premiums have been talked about a tremendous amount today. 
We have extended our programs. 
We have tried to do everything we can to give the worker the best opportunity.  
The fairness issue is extremely important.  
The House will now proceed to the taking of the deferred divisions.  
The question is on Motion No. 1.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 1, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 1 defeated.  
Is there unanimous consent to proceed this way?  
See list under Division No. 182 ] 
I therefore declare Motion No. 3 defeated.  
Is there agreement to proceed in this fashion?  
Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members present vote no to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, Bloc Quebecois members oppose this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, NDP members present vote yes to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, members of our party are in favour of this motion.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 2, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 2 carried. 
I therefore declare Motion No. 4 carried.  
The next question is on Motion No. 6. 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members vote yes to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, of course, Bloc Quebecois members are abviously voting in favour of this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, NDP members present will vote yes to this motion.

Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
That is only fair.  
We are rated as the best country in the world by the United Nations. 
We are a very fair and a very generous country. 
We do not have any consideration being given to those victims after 1990. 
Unfortunately, the government cannot substantiate that number. 
One would ask why it would use a number that cannot be substantiated. 
That is the sort of convoluted logic in my way of thinking. 
The number is far less than that. 
They are back today as we speak.  
He is back at the bargaining table with the provinces today.  
I am hopeful that a package will be arrived at. 
We are hopeful that that will happen.
