Allotted Day-Canadian Economy 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 59 
Friday, February 13, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
ALLOTTED DAY-CANADIAN ECONOMY 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP) moved: 
It was a legacy that we were all proud of as Canadians.  
The number of food banks has tripled in Canada since 1989. 
That is what this debate is all about this morning. 
What are the reasons for this? 
I think there are four or five very obvious reasons. 
Second, there is no priority in this country to create jobs. 
These are some of the reasons why the disparity is growing. 
We see tremendous disparities.  
Frank Stronach had compensation last year of $43.2 million. 
That salary is $43.2 million.  
That does not matter. 
These growing disparities in our country ought to be of great concern to us. 
That is not a very good legacy to leave to the next generation.  
This is based on household income. 
It is an extremely important issue. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
I would like to know if he is suggesting that. 
People watching the debate should know that Reformers are against this motion. 
We are not talking about printing money. 
That is not what we are talking about.  
That is the direction we want to go in. 
We can do it through the tax system. 
We can do it through the federal government spending money on health and education. 
They worship at the altar of Mike Harris. 
They worship at the altar of Ralph Klein. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Let me give you an example. 
This is not a hypothetical case. 
I would like to hear what he has to say about this.  
Mr. Speaker, I fully agree with my hon. colleague from Quebec. 
It is an old-style ideology, a Margaret Thatcher ideology. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
That has to be addressed in the upcoming budget.  
We have to ask what are the reasons for this growing inequality. 
The real evidence is in the changes to our employment insurance program. 
More than that, we have seen debate take place about the multilateral agreement on investment. 
Of that he is paying $540 a month in rent. 
That is an issue of being one step away from homelessness. 
That is an issue of stark reality in my riding. 
He lives in a cardboard box. 
Again the message was the same. 
We are willing to set targets to reduce poverty. 
We are willing to ensure there is a national child care program. 
We are willing to say there is a national housing program. 
That is why we are condemning this government for the policies it has enacted.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
So it is one thing we do agree with.  
It just does not work.  
Capitalism does have a heart, but we see a different way of getting there. 
We have a plan to get there and it is beginning to work. 
We can see it in Alberta and in Ontario. 
Unemployment nationally is going down. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
The response to the question is that we need to have fair taxation. 
I particularly support the tax system they are advocating. 
I think the Canadian tax system is unfair. 
Here is an example. 
Do not give up, we are behind you. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his comments. 
We in the NDP agree with the comments that have been made. 
The hon. member mentioned the need for child care. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Unfortunately there have been no solutions presented today. 
Is the NDP solution to regulate and cap salaries and profits?  
Our overall tax burden is about 30% higher than that of Americans. 
However, I would never advocate that we should go down to American levels. 
They have great envy for the rich. 
Maybe a lot of people do. 
However, these are the facts. 
What have we heard in terms of solutions? 
I have talked about their cry for tax fairness. 
Do they want to tax the rich more? 
That alternative is there. 
One of our major concerns has been low income working families. 
It was a barrier to leaving welfare and going into the workforce. 
This is why we brought in the working income supplement. 
At the same time, we have increased the tax incentives available to Canadians with disabilities. 
Why don't you brag about raising taxes 38 times?  
Thirty-eight tax raises.  
Bring in civility to the House.  
Civility is not within that new member's lexicon.  
We have done that through the tax system.  
He announced the creation of the millennium scholarship fund. 
We have put our money where our mouth is.  
Canadian banks pay 64% of their net income in Canadian taxes.  
Let us hear about it if the Canadian bank profits are obscene. 
The leadership race in the member's party is over. 
Maybe it is time he started to support his leader.  
Now you are bragging about tax increases.  
We are making those investments and we are proud to do it.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Who ultimately pays for increased taxes? 
Those taxes fall on the shoulders of the public. 
The worst unemployment we have seen since the depression.  
I cannot let pass the NDP comments. 
Proud NDPers wear their hearts on their sleeves. 
They profess to be the saviour of the poor and underprivileged. 
Increasing taxes, increasing government spending and increasing deficits do what? 
When we took office the deficit was at $42 billion. 
We are starting to pay down the debt. 
At the same time we will never adopt the Reform formula for doing it. 
This is the party that was to cut taxes. 
At the same time how would Reformers have paid for it? 
First, they would cut drastically the programs to help with the pensions of seniors. 
Second, they would cut transfers to the provinces for education and for health care. 
We will have a balanced approach. 
Those are our priorities.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
It is always a little bemusing to me when the NDP castigates Reform. 
That is what life is all about. 
It is about creating a strong, vibrant future and life for ourselves and our families. 
That is important to every Canadian.  
The NDP also talks about the future of our youth. 
The future of our youth is the future of our country. 
In that I know we all concur. 
What is the NDP solution? 
It is something that we pride ourselves on. 
The same old failed policies of the past are being touted by the NDP. 
It simply will not wash. 
That is the spirit and that is the energy that will give us real prosperity. 
We need smaller, more efficient government. 
Just hand it over because we know much better what to do with it''.  
NDPers talk about fair taxes. 
It does not work that way.  
I hesitate to interrupt the hon. member. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians want accountable politicians. 
Canadians are calling for the return of some integrity and purpose to the Canadian Senate. 
It is unacceptable that the Senate is plagued with chronic absenteeism. 
It must be a Senate that is elected, effective and equitable''. 
Good words, but are they just empty words?  
THE LATE EDDIE SARGENT 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
Eddie Sargent's political career spanned more than four decades. 
Eddie fought aggressively for his constituents. 
No problem was too big or too small. 
He put so much into life. 
He was a man with a heart and we will miss him.  
TRIBUTE TO DORA WASSERMAN 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
After training at the prestigious Jewish theatre in Moscow, she arrived in Montreal in 1950. 
Congratulations Dora Wasserman for making Quebec culture even richer.  
HUNTINGTON SOCIETY OF CANADA 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
It is entitled ``People's resolution for a united Canada'': 
The end of the resolution says: 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
No. The Prime Minister asked him to stay on until after the election. 
The people of British Columbia, the people of this country, want value for money. 
They want a democracy. 
They want a triple E Senate.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
We have great expectations.  
These are the families of Joe Nieuwendyk, Adam Foote and Keith Primeau. 
These three talented players are products of the Whitby Minor Hockey Association.  
The town of Whitby wanted to recognize and cheer on our local heroes. 
All of Canada will be cheering our team on. 
To Adam, Joe and Keith, bring home the gold.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The petition therefore received no response from Parliament, and nothing has changed. 
The new Minister of Justice has still made no announcement.  
The minister must act.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
They are seated in the gallery watching today's proceedings.  
The future of our country will rest on their shoulders.  
We must not fail them.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we now have everybody criticizing Andy Thompson, even Senator Ron Ghitter.  
That is a pretty expensive lazy boy.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
It must be because it does not suit their needs.  
When the Saguenay flood occurred, who was there? 
Canadians have always loved and helped Quebec, a province of Canada. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mills such as Lohne's, Bowater and Turners continue to operate in the area.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
In 1996 foreign investment in Canada grew to $180 billion. 
As a trading country, Canada relies on these investments. 
Our social programs and safety net depend on the success of our economy.  
For every $1 billion in new foreign investment 45,000 jobs are created in Canada. 
They are opposed to the MAI. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I have witnessed the dedicated efforts of some of our honourable senators. 
It is time for an elected Senate. 
I urge members to read Standing Order 18 before our next meeting.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Is the finance minister finally going to listen to overtaxed Canadians? 
Is he going to offer broad based tax relief in the upcoming budget?  
Keep your hands in your pockets.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no money in my pockets. 
I am about to be cut off but I would like to go on.  
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to save him. 
He is the greatest tax collector the country has ever seen. 
That goes without saying. 
But yesterday the Alberta treasurer showed him that it could be done. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is putting more money into health care. 
It is putting more money into education. 
It is putting more money into the priorities of Albertans.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Would she lend a copy of this debt management software program to our finance minister? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the matter has not been concluded before the courts.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The law must always be respected''.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the position of Canada and of other countries is very clear. 
That is why we are continuing our efforts to reach a diplomatic solution.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the troops are on their way. 
The government keeps telling us that their involvement will be limited to logistical support.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We recognize that youth unemployment is an issue. 
That is our first priority. 
We have also put a number of initiatives in place to deal with that.  
If the member would like us to send a copy of all those- 
The hon. member for Sydney-Victoria.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I would ask him to abide by the rules of the House in this regard.  
Mr. Speaker, I stand corrected and I apologize to the House.  
Canadian youth want opportunity, not amazing rhetoric. 
Is the government prepared to stop discriminating against young people?  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is just the opposite. 
The intent is to have young people go back to school. 
It is a very important initiative. 
All members of the House should support that.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are examining the entire issue. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
However this support is based on the entire declaration especially the equality aspects.  
The government remains prepared to support it.  
Most provinces are prepared to pass a resolution. 
We will be waiting to see the final result before taking action.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
At Health Canada we have procedures in place- 
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Why has no action been taken since?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We plan to keep improving this system in the interest of the sick.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
He got out of prison and then recently sexually assaulted some of our children. 
Yesterday he was back in court again. 
Molesting a five year old boy.  
My question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
What about protecting our women and children for a change?  
As opposed to having''- 
He is from British Columbia.  
We are sick and tired of this. 
We want it now. 
The parliamentary secretary has the floor. 
It is difficult for the Chair to hear her response. 
A member has asked a question, perhaps members might listen to the response.  
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice.  
I repeat, if we have to we will.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
This is what it tries to do at all times.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister had a choice. 
The prime minister chose to meet Castro's henchman.  
How could the government justify this choice by the Prime Minister?  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We will continue our constructive engagement with Cuba. 
We do not make invidious comparisons. 
Does the hon. member want us to join Jesse Helms?  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
He did not even give him the courtesy of an official meeting.  
Why will the government not admit exactly what its choices are?  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are no back doors to the foreign ministry. 
He met him in his MP office. 
The Prime Minister was too busy.  
We will continue our policy of constructive engagement with China. 
We apply human rights to every government we deal with.  
CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION ACT 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We have added one day in Vancouver, one in Toronto and one in Montreal.  
CANADA'S ASBESTOS INDUSTRY 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The best strategy, we believe, is to pursue a common front among all stakeholders.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Who is the latest to leave the sty for the public trough? 
His name is Stephen Gaon. 
Mr. Gaon is now a chairperson of the EI board of referees.  
My question is for the little minister who went to market. 
There are millions of Canadians who need work. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Surely the hon. member should praise that type of activity. 
The person appointed is a person of competence. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, when we deal with appointments we are dealing with matters of merit. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, no deal has been signed. 
It is under negotiation. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a shipbuilding policy. 
It includes very generous write-offs for depreciation. 
Nothing in the proposed agreement would imperil any of those measures.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
It is not like 1991 when Canada played an important role. 
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of National Defence did say something. 
He said there was a series of inoculations. 
However I would like to say this. 
What is the point here? 
Is the opposition trying to score points for scaremongering? 
It knows that what we have in place is a first class protection agency.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we are not scaremongering. 
We are asking serious questions.  
I have here the vaccine manufacturer's instructions to the U.S. forces. 
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have recently placed a doctor on board the Toronto . 
It will give protection to both hands and body. 
They are given instruction on how to decontaminate one another.  
While the members of the Conservative Party are playing loose politics- 
The hon. member for Mount Royal.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question.  
The hon. member for Cypress Hills-Grasslands.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
There is a double standard in Canada. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
This money could be spent on health and education.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
We are continuing to hire new auditors. 
I very much support the hon. member. 
We are working to do that.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
This sudden change in policy will have an enormous financial impact on the industry. 
Layoffs have already been announced.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
We will work toward ensuring that we comply fully and are sensitive to their concerns.  
ATOMIC ENERGY CONTROL BOARD 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
The public may be assured that the AECB will monitor the situation very closely. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Yesterday we asked if the report of this investigation would be tabled. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend is quite wrong. 
The minister is not investigating herself. 
We are bound by the rule of law. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I ask that you designate an order of the day for consideration of the motion.

Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-CANADIAN ECONOMY 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois has suggestions to make and I will suggest a few solutions.  
In some districts, the unemployment level exceeds 15%.  
The first victims of this tragedy are children, young people and women. 
Canada has the lowest basic child allowance.  
The problem is equally dramatic where young people are concerned. 
In addition, they savagely attacked the unemployed. 
Measures such as these saved this government $2 billion.  
That is what the Liberal government has done. 
That is how they have reduced their deficit. 
The Bloc Quebecois has some suggestions. 
We are asking the government to change the employment insurance plan. 
We are asking the government to make targeted income tax reductions. 
The day may not be so far off.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
We have heard from all parties in this House at the present time.  
They have the best employment.  
I want to refer the member for Qu'Appelle to my province of Saskatchewan- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, they look alike. 
We have a government that has sold many of its crown corporations. 
It has lowered the taxes to multinational corporations. 
It has lowered the taxes in potash. 
You do not create jobs by continuing high taxation. 
That is the point we have to get across.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, you are going to confuse him. 
He cannot look at two people at the same time.  
What the Bloc Quebecois is calling for is a review of the taxation system. 
That is where the problem lies. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the hon. member for Quebec's comments. 
She talked about many things.  
For example, we introduced a new tax treatment of child support.  
Thirty-eight tax raises.  
I did not interrupt you when you were speaking.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Quebec. 
The Liberals have got off to a slow start on this. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Now the Liberals claim that tax. 
They flip-flopped on renegotiating the NAFTA treaty. 
We know now how big the cheque Canadians must write is for zero helicopters.  
Meanwhile Canadians have the highest personal income taxes among the G-7 nations. 
By the way, I have another interesting statistic. 
The average American is now 25% richer than the average Canadian. 
These are interesting facts and these things have taken place since 1993. 
In reality it is another Liberal gimmick. 
They will not address the real issue here.  
I am sure the people of Newfoundland and Labrador will not be congratulating it either. 
What a statistic of failure.  
We should forget about making the millennium scholarship wholly contingent on marks and performance. 
Eligibility for part of the scholarship should be based on financial need. 
That is what the new seniors benefit will do.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Does he agree with his cousins in the Reform Party that they are overtaxed?  
I am not that familiar with millionaires and the amount of tax they pay. 
I do not believe millionaires are too heavily taxed. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I understand the Mulroney years is something they want to put behind them.  
I want to relate my questions directly to two points. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sure hon. members would thank each other through the Chair.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a few comments to make. 
I wonder what kind of society we will have 20 years from now. 
My time is up, but I will get back to this issue.  
Mr. Speaker, I have just a quick response for the Bloc member. 
We are all very concerned about poverty. 
I have just one comment to make. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I too commend the hon. member for Burin-St. 
George's on his speech. 
I know he is not a cousin of the Reform Party. 
I suppose we could refer to ourselves almost as cousins. 
Today we are seeing that even the middle class is shrinking. 
I am pleased to speak to this motion which states: 
We are talking about the new prosperity in the country.  
We live in a prosperous country. 
Many of us are the products of those very good social programs.  
Most Canadians are happy to have a good job and a good paycheque. 
They are not seeking to be millionaires. 
Each generation gave to the next hope and prosperity. 
I remember the first food bank in my community. 
It was a small little church hall called Loaves & Fishes. 
They were ahead of their time. 
The hon. member indicated that our caucus met with representatives of the food banks. 
It is reminiscent of the dirty thirties.  
In my community that has meant a decrease in the population of young people. 
This is because of policies of the government that encourage a migrant workforce. 
One of them would be to change the GST the government adopted. 
In terms of education, the comments from the member for Burin-St. 
For the young people of this nation, I ask for support of our motion.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favour of our motion.  
Equally serious was the loss of the Canada assistance plan. 
The war on the deficit was won largely on the backs of social programs. 
It has cut too deep, yet still not deep enough for the Reform Party.  
Because we want a caring, just society.  
The gap between the super rich and ordinary Canadian families is widening. 
Since 1989 that gap has grown. 
Young Canadians do not have much to look forward to. 
Youth unemployment deeply affects my riding in Manitoba. 
Young people in my riding and elsewhere in Canada deserve a better future. 
It is unacceptable that most aboriginal people are at or below the poverty line. 
Unemployment does not only affect young people. 
It affected 8.9% of Canadians last month. 
Hundreds and thousands of Canadians have simply given up looking for work. 
As far as Statistics Canada is concerned, they disappear from the labour market.  
Another sad trend in the job market is multiple job holdings. 
Five per cent of our labour force holds more than one job. 
The richer are getting richer and ordinary Canadians are getting poorer. 
This is the Liberal legacy into the new millennium. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to my colleague from the NDP. 
Eagleson has also been selling furniture for many years. 
What we are asking for is a fair system. 
All Canadians should pay fairly.  
In Thompson recently the new tax changes on a $1,500 bursary- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I have many good friends who have an NDP philosophy. 
We have many good discussions. 
In fact some of them have more respect for me than I deserve. 
I was very honoured by that. 
It is a very serious question. 
I would like her response to that question.  
The tax system has traditionally been unfair. 
It means that we want this government to be held accountable. 
It does not mean we do not want those programs.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I want to ask the member a question on a specific item. 
I do not want her to go all over the place with her answer.  
Is it her position that there should be no overtime?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt, but the parliamentary secretary is on debate.  
Talk about the debt.  
Something had to be done about the deficit. 
Canada is poised to be a leader in this new economy. 
We have put our fiscal house in order. 
From a trade standpoint, we are one of the most open economies in the world. 
We have many improvements to make in terms of trade. 
But having such assets is not enough. 
We all understand that. 
It will open new ways for citizens to express their views in a democracy.  
It brings citizens together from coast to coast to coast in either official language. 
It gives our creative community a new vehicle for cultural expression.  
There is the community access program, better known as CAP. 
That is over 5,000 communities.  
Another initiative is SchoolNet. 
SchoolNet is also about content and connecting Canadians.  
Computers for schools is another initiative. 
May I repeat that it is getting 32,000 hits a day.  
Canada is well on its way to becoming a world-class connected country. 
In a knowledge based economy our most important resources are people. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
They were members of the Ottawa-Carleton Health Coalition.  
Their theme was to put the heart back into medicare. 
How does the government intend to connect with Canadians in that way?  
That is what is happening today. 
It makes it easier for them. 
The regulations have been gazetted. 
We have another two weeks to go before the end of the gazetting. 
Almost 200 witnesses were in attendance. 
The member's party was absent most of the time. 
As far as I am concerned there was very little attendance by his party.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I see the member wants it both ways. 
Get involved but do not get involved. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ) moved: 
I would like these fine words to be more than just talk for a change. 
They promised them that they would act. 
But the Liberal government would rather continue playing its hypocritical game. 
The treatment of Louis Riel is a very powerful symbol for the Metis people. 
He was a gifted student, always the first in his class. 
He learned Greek, Latin, French, English and Cree.  
They traded with the States more than they did with Canada. 
In December 1869, the Hudson's Bay Company ceased to administer the country. 
Riel recruited and organized a company of armed horsemen to defend the borders.  
This forced him into exile in the United States.  
This became impossible because he was under the threat of death or arrest.  
When he was re-elected in February 1874, Riel went to Ottawa. 
He was expelled under a motion tabled by the Ontario Orangemen. 
He returned west in 1878. 
In 1881, he settled in Montana, where he married Marguerite Monet and fathered three children.  
The Metis were afraid of losing their lands to Canadian Pacific.  
They created a small republic and launched a peaceful protest to have it recognized.  
They requested permission to sent delegates to Ottawa to defend their rights. 
Riel was taken prisoner on May 15, 1885.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Riel was educated in theology and law. 
He was fluent in English, French, Greek, Latin and Cree. 
The rights of other citizens were also clearly set out in the list of rights.  
In 1970 a postage stamp was issued in his commemoration. 
Let us be clear on one thing. 
He was never an advocate of separation. 
He did not want to tear the country apart. 
Rather he gave his life trying to build it.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Clearly this is an emotional issue for some people on both sides of the debate. 
Being Canadian means something.  
It is a powerful moment.  
Somehow I feel their stories have been kept from us. 
Some seem to think this type of art is good for Canada. 
It is not my preference.  
Instead, I prefer a greater focus on our heritage and culture. 
He assimilated into their culture. 
He sounds like a Reformer to me.  
Or, more recently, in the early part of this century, Mr. Georges Vanier. 
After convalescing, he refused evacuation. 
In early 1967, Vanier's heart showed signs of weakening. 
I pray to God that we may go forward hand in hand''.  
There are many more Canadian heroes that we all need to know more about. 
This publication will encourage us all to inspire our children.  
The pen that rewrites history will always be driven by today's biases. 
It is better not to do it.  
My fellow Canadians, we have much to be thankful for. 
In fact, we have an obligation to celebrate the strengths of this great nation.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion.  
The history of the Metis treatment by the Canadian government is appalling. 
The points that I have called for are not new. 
The Metis are not asking for special status. 
But what is a people without a land base? 
Who are these people that Louis Riel led at one time? 
The royal commission has made it easy for us. 
What of Metis education and culture?  
First, consultation with Metis elders when educational programs are planned. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Rimouski-Mitis has raised two issues. 
Should we pardon Louis Riel.  
Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to speak from my heart on this matter. 
I commend and applaud the member for Rimouski-Mitis for raising this important issue. 
Time is past due that we deal with this piece of Canada's history.  
I have been and I still am an avid reader of history. 
History should be understood in the context that it occurred, analysed and remembered. 
History should not be revisionist, whitewashed or politically correct. 
History is about facts. 
Certainly the government is able to revoke the verdict of guilty of high treason. 
The question is, should we pardon Louis Riel? 
I say why not. 
Louis David Riel is a unique case. 
His case in all respects is uniquely Canadian. 
He met Louis Joseph Papineau of the 1837 rebellion.  
It is not my intent to present a history of Louis Riel's life. 
It has been well documented. 
My intent is to portray a unique and truly Canadian story.  
In December 1869 he became president of the provisional government. 
This act would force Riel into exile.  
This is only a thumbnail sketch of Louis Riel. 
Sir John A. Macdonald himself agonized over the decision to execute Riel. 
Sir John A. Macdonald eventually succumbed to that pressure.  
In 1870 he had Thomas Scott executed. 
Should we pardon Louis Riel? 
I say yes, we should. 
We in this House and the other place hold the power to pardon him. 
This pardon is not about a judgment. 
This pardon is about reconciliation.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have two other hon. members who have indicated interest in speaking. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Her appointment was in large part due to her unwavering dedication to Metis issues. 
Louis Riel had a vision for this country over 100 years ago. 
Riel was a man of action, a man who looked forward and into the future. 
He was not a separatist. 
He wanted in, not out. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
This is how we know about things which happen.  
There is no need to go back to it.  
The man was hung. 
He did not, when he had the opportunity, grovel. 
He did not ask for mercy. 
He walked to the gallows quite firmly and strongly. 
He was not dragged kicking and screaming. 
Actually, he did not have totally clean hands. 
He set in motion a rebellion which cost lives. 
The man, let us face it, had a big ego. 
He wanted to be in charge. 
He did what he chose to do. 
We have more important things to do than to debate gestures. 
Let us face it, this would just be a gesture.  
My advice to this House is to get on with it. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Those are the rules.  
I acknowledge that the motion merits improvement. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 2.33 p.m.)
