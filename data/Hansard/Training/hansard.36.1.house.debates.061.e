Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
All the advice we received was valuable, but much of it was conflicting. 
It safeguards our grain marketing strengths. 
It deepens the wheat board's accountability. 
The debate has been intense, and that is not surprising. 
That is their right.  
Will the Canadian Wheat Board become more accountable to farmers? 
The answer is emphatically yes.  
That is what democracy is all about.  
Will the directors have real power? 
Again the answer is yes.  
The directors will select one of their own to be chairperson. 
Again the answer is yes.  
The answer is yes.  
Fully audited financial statements appear in every CWB annual report. 
The CWB is obviously a commercial operation. 
There is one final telling point. 
They can make their own inquiry in public right now. 
The committee has that power. 
They just want another excuse to attack the wheat board.  
Is it necessary for the government to appoint some directors and the president? 
The answer is yes for two reasons.  
Therefore it performs a national function.  
The appointed directors, five in total, will have no special power or status. 
Can the directors effectively demonstrate their disapproval of a president? 
The answer again is yes.  
The government can appoint a president only after it has consulted with the directors. 
Finally-and this is the real hammer-the directors also control the president's salary.  
No one is shielded from their responsibilities. 
Does the Canadian Wheat Board need a contingency fund? 
The answer is yes.  
But as with all new innovations, there could be some new financial risks. 
Question nine is about exclusions. 
The answer under Bill C-4 is yes.  
Question ten is about inclusions. 
The answer again under Bill C-4 is yes.  
They will be in control.  
The opposition said no to that proposition. 
It denied the clear opportunity to make that change. 
What does that tell us about the opposition? 
Is it really interested in constructive change? 
Is it really interested in the substance of the matter?  
We do not like dictators and people who put farmers in jail. 
That is what we do not like.  
I invite hon. members to restrain themselves. 
I am sure all hon. members want to hear the minister's speech.  
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:
They denied the clear opportunity to make that change. 
Their conduct speaks for itself. 
The opposition clearly has a problem with democracy.  
Its passage will signal an era of change for the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was not in the House at the time but my understanding is- 
It sounds very much like a matter for argument. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
We were not in the House. 
That is a point of order.  
With respect, it is not. 
I respectfully suggest that we resume the debate, which is what this is about.  
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:
Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of clarification. 
We are getting a little astray here.  
Mr. Speaker, what motion? 
He has not put a motion in front of us. 
I have not seen anything. 
I ask him to show us the motion.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I presume that will be an equal split without questions or comments.  
I would like to clear up a potential misunderstanding. 
I would like to elaborate on that point for a couple of minutes.  
Currently there are 59 members in the Reform Party caucus. 
They have friends and family members actively farming in western Canada. 
He has been a grain farmer for 28 years. 
He has 1,000 acres cultivated and still actively farms. 
His sons are increasingly involved in the family operation.  
He has been a grain farmer for seven years. 
He has 900 acres cultivated and 100 acres in pasture. 
He currently leases out his farm but he still lives on the farm.  
The hon. member for Athabasca, Alberta, grew up on a farm. 
He has been a grain and cattle farmer for 35 years. 
I grew up on a farm in British Columbia in Peace River country. 
My brother and I have 3,000 acres. 
He has 250 acres cultivated and 3,800 acres in pasture. 
We were trying to encourage them to speak. 
They did not want to take part in the debate. 
We were trying to say that we have a bit of credibility on this issue. 
That is what we were trying to say. 
They have been listening to farmers, processors and any other stakeholders in the grain industry. 
That is how the monopoly came into existence.  
Is the Canadian Wheat Board getting the best price for farmers' grain? 
In fact, it is worse than that. 
They have every right to choose that course. 
It was a fleeting glimpse indeed. 
It was a long wait indeed.  
In addition, the panel was not to begin its work until January 1996. 
The mandate of the panel was indeed encouraging. 
It rejected those proposals.  
Reaction to the panel's report was fairly positive. 
On December 6, 1995 the Alberta government held its own plebiscite on the CWB. 
The two questions on the voting ballots were direct. 
It outlined choices which included the Canadian Wheat Board.  
The minister continued to procrastinate. 
He even attempted to deter the Alberta government from holding its plebiscite. 
However, the vote was limited to the marketing of barley. 
It was a simple question, simply deceitful.  
They just want the monopoly to be removed.  
The barley vote results were announced on March 25, 1996. 
Imagine what the result would have been if the question had been properly asked. 
It did not come. 
I see I only have one minute left. 
That is simply false. 
It is not accurate. 
In light of that, I would like to move the following motion: 
I believe it is in order. 
The hon. member's time has expired.  
The debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Any initiative to reform the Canadian Wheat Board should be a good thing. 
Certainly there is a need for some reform of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
They all recognize that. 
I will do this under four headings. 
In fact, the opposition is really against every part of Bill C-4. 
Finally, I will talk about where we go from here.  
First, what is the real debate? 
That is completely untrue. 
The wheat board provides a valuable service to western Canadian farmers. 
Therefore that is not the issue.  
They are in fact the farmers who pay for the operation of the wheat board.  
Again, the real debate revolves around the monopoly of the wheat board. 
That is a question that more and more western Canadian farmers are asking. 
Whose grain is it? 
First I will talk a bit about the monopoly. 
It is also arguable that it will not improve it at all.  
Farmers have called for openness in the wheat board. 
Fourth is the issue of whose grain it is. 
That question is certainly not answered by this bill.  
Those are the issues that should be debated. 
Unfortunately this bill does very little to add to the debate in those areas.  
A coalition has been organized strictly to go against Bill C-4. 
The coalition has focused on the inclusion clause. 
They were so concerned that they formed a coalition. 
The list of member organizations which form this coalition is quite impressive. 
These are major western Canadian organizations. 
That has been the main focus of their actions over the past years. 
However the opposition comes from all sides of this issue.  
That is how bad this legislation is. 
This is from the advisory committee.  
Is the intent of this minister to destroy the wheat board? 
I wonder if that is his intent. 
The thought has occurred to me. 
These issues are the key issues dealt with in Bill C-4. 
I have a very strong personal opinion about the wheat board monopoly. 
I am very strongly against it. 
It is a very emotional issue for me because it involves my people. 
We are talking about their very livelihoods.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
An hon. member is saying ``Keep on going''. 
These letters are available for anyone who would like to read them.  
The opposition is not just coming from me or my Reform colleagues. 
The opposition is coming from farmers and farm groups across western Canada.  
In fact it invoked closure on the bill. 
We only have one day to debate third reading of the bill. 
Many are still involved in farming as I am. 
My farm is rented out on a crop share. 
I have wheat and barley to market. 
Are they speaking for western Canadian farmers? 
Western Canadian farmers have spoken out against the bill. 
Who are they speaking for?  
It is a hare-brained idea he came forward with. 
It has ignored the democratic process. 
It has ignored the submissions to committee. 
The bill should have been canned a long time ago. 
We should have started from scratch.  
Where to from here? 
No, it does not.  
In one way the bill has united farmers. 
That is the only way it has united farmers and not in a positive way.  
It will further split farmers. 
We see debate on the issue increasing. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
At that time, membership in the Canadian Wheat Board was optional. 
There was no monopoly. 
Since then, the Canadian Wheat Board has undergone only slight changes. 
I will leave that up to your imagination.  
It is very important, and because of its importance, they are setting a time limit. 
We have nothing to sink our teeth into. 
Perhaps someone could check on Deloitte & Touche.  
This government takes good care of those who show their gratitude. 
That is one thing.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Below cost, of course. 
We lose money on each pig that comes out of the hog house.  
This is how the Liberal government of the member for Saint-Maurice manages our affairs.  
I received hundreds of letters. 
He would see what producers think of his bill. 
Some object to the inclusion provisions. 
Others to the exclusion clauses. 
Others still to the reserve fund or the appointment process. 
You have no business being involved in this''.  
Who will make the appointment? 
The governor in council. 
And who is the governor in council? 
And that is how it will take place.  
You are not acting in your own best interests. 
For once, the agriculture committee would have had a role to play. 
You would have gained back some self-esteem''. 
Anyway, it is a known fact that the chair of each committee is a Liberal. 
The prerequisite was to be of the right colour politically.  
He led his troops to electoral disaster. 
Today he is the embarrassment of all the other senators. 
He was expelled from the Liberal Party for trying to boost the family fortunes. 
Now they are trying various ways to expel him from the Senate.  
How many of my constituents have wondered why we do not abolish the Senate? 
It was more profitable to burn them than to harvest them. 
This is worrisome; it stinks. 
One thing is for sure: the process will definitely lack transparency. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
That obviously turned out not to be the case.  
I found the committee experience to be a hollow exercise, by and large. 
There clearly was a rush to judgment on this. 
It is our contention, sadly, that this will weaken the Canadian Wheat Board.  
Therefore we have no alternative but to oppose.  
They supported it six decades ago and still support it now. 
Why do farmers support the wheat board? 
Farmers, therefore, by and large support the wheat board. 
The New Democrats join them in that support. 
How does it undermine the board? 
For one thing, Bill C-4 will propose cash buying. 
The fund is not needed. 
Farmers cannot afford it. 
Finally there is the question of governance. 
That, too, was reflected on how we voted last night.  
I will come back to that in a few moments.  
Why are they afraid of a vote by producers? 
We do not believe in that. 
We think the Liberals cannot be trusted on the Canadian Wheat Board. 
It would quickly destroy the Canadian Wheat Board.  
That is something Reformers refuse to acknowledge. 
I would like to speak to the Reform amendment we are technically debating. 
Let us deal with some of the facts. 
The CWB is a $6 billion a year operation. 
I have looked through the Deloitte & Touche annual report. 
The last one was issued in 1996. 
The auditors pronounced the wheat board to be in good shape.  
So much for openness, transparency and accountability.  
New Democrats have always supported the Canadian Wheat Board. 
We believe it is in the best interest of farmers. 
Therefore we reluctantly oppose Bill C-4.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
The member said that Reformers are against the board. 
That is blatantly false. 
Let us look at the amendments I have proposed to protect the board. 
It would also protect the board against international agreements that would destroy the board. 
Does he see that as dual marketing?  
In relation to that question, if farmers want that option what would he then say? 
My constituents gave me a very clear indication of where they stand on the issue. 
This is what farmers want. 
Is the government not obligated to carry that out?  
Also I want to refer to property rights. 
Does he feel that property rights in Canada should be strengthened? 
Does he agree with either of those two statements.  
That is what Alberta Justice Muldoon said. 
That is what the Reform Party refuses to discuss. 
We do not think that option can or will work.  
What if farmers want it?  
There are provisions to include and exclude grains. 
I simply do not believe in the 83% to 87%. 
Is it 53% or 43%?  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to listen to the debate. 
That is the way some communist countries have gone. 
Would the member agree that is the way to go? 
If it is good for me it should be good for the next guy. 
What is good for the goose is good for the gander. 
The government could own all the cars as the government did in the Soviet Union. 
We know what happened over there. 
They are all on a junk pile right now. 
That is how good that monopoly was.  
Why not a monopoly on lawyer services or teachers? 
Are they right on the world scene today? 
Is that the kind of system the member wants?  
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
He said that Reform members were speaking out of both sides of their mouths. 
That is absolutely, blatantly false. 
My colleagues brought him up short on that comment.  
Mr. Speaker, it is an oranges and apples question. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
They have shown that time and time again.  
What is happening over there is all smoke and mirrors. 
Would the member for Palliser agree?  
Mr. Speaker, I agree very much. 
That was the thrust of my remarks.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
I would like to speak on a number of issues in a number of areas. 
First, I am not a producer. 
I am not a farmer. 
It has been known as that particular city since its inception in 1982. 
Our philosophy is fairly simple.  
We believe in free enterprise. 
We believe in choice. 
We believe in less government and less government control. 
For those people who are listening I would like to make an analogy. 
There is a large capital cost for that.  
He must be at the whim and unfortunately the nature of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
He can sell it to the United States or to Europe. 
Let us talk a little bit about the history of this which is very important. 
The Canadian Wheat Board is a very good institution, make no mistake about that. 
Let us talk about history.  
It worked because they felt they were being taken advantage of by the corporations.  
I was not around as I was not even born yet. 
I wasn't born yet either.  
I obviously made a mistake by giving my age away here. 
Anyway, I am giving a passionate speech here.  
In 1943 the right decision was made. 
The CWB has not kept up with the final marketing techniques.  
It brought in what was known as a government guarantee. 
Those pillars are still in place at the present time but times have changed. 
Unfortunately the government with this legislation is not managing change. 
The change is managing the government and it is not going to work.  
I would also like to talk about the process. 
It has been about a six or seven month period. 
I have always said I will be constructive in my comments. 
The process was rushed. 
It should not work that way. 
I like the committee. 
Nobody has a lock on the best possible legislation. 
There is always a chance for improvement and we had that. 
It had to go through before the Christmas recess. 
Unfortunately it is now February. 
It did not go through before Christmas. 
Why could we not have heard from it? 
Because we did not have time in committee. 
Then the bill came to this House. 
So the government stopped the debate.  
Let me go on to some of the areas which we still have concerns with. 
A commissioner form of governance does not work as management.  
The government was almost there, but it did not go far enough. 
Then we go to the board of directors. 
The government was almost there. 
It is a farmer-producer board. 
But it did not go far enough. 
It came from the Reform Party and me. 
It said simply that the corporation should be working for the farmers. 
The corporation will be working for the producers. 
The government turned it down. 
I cannot believe it turned that amendment down.  
Let us talk about accountability and access to information. 
What if the corporation is not working in their best interests? 
They should have access to information.  
We talk about choice. 
The government would not accept those as well.  
Now all of a sudden it rears its head. 
It is the clause that has to be put into this legislation, Bill C-4. 
Quite frankly I have not found anybody who wants that clause. 
I have not found anybody who says give us the inclusion clause. 
I am very disappointed.  
We have been dealing with this for six months. 
The inclusion clause has always been an issue. 
It cannot be done three hours before the amendment is going to be voted on.  
I see that my time is up. 
It has been a very interesting process, to say the least. 
It has been an interesting piece of legislation. 
The government has not managed the change.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, we have heard a fairly slanted view of history from the hon. member.  
He said where was the government the last six months. 
That is where some of the changes came from.  
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris began his remarks by talking about free enterprise. 
He believes in free enterprise and he believes in choice. 
It is collective selling. 
That is good marketing management. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Study after study has been done. 
That is good marketing. 
It is using techniques. 
It offers the choice which he claims to support.  
Those are the kinds of improvements which came about as a result of committee hearings. 
Would he not agree?  
Madam Speaker, there were some wonderful questions in that rhetoric.  
This is one of those cases. 
So we agree to disagree.  
I will answer his questions. 
It did not manage change into the 21st century.  
What is the member afraid of? 
If it is that good, it should be able to compete.  
I made a comment in this House not long ago. 
They were opened to competition, telephones, electric and gas. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
He has had a year and a half with this legislation. 
We had it at committee. 
They do not have any Atlantic Canada representatives. 
I have one from Ontario as well. 
We truly are representative across Canada. 
We have a national party. 
We will get that out of the way first of all.  
Unfortunately it did not change it substantively. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
We have heard that said over and over. 
Farmers would be empowered to direct their own wheat board. 
They deserve to have the power to design their own futures.  
I emphasize the support which exists outside the Chamber for this legislation. 
The committee heard from more than 40 groups and 40 individuals. 
Many more people supported the legislation than opposed it.  
The government listened and the committee took action. 
Those amendments are reflected in Bill C-4.  
The majority of directors, 10 out of 15, would be elected directly by farmers themselves.  
This is more than unique. 
They will listen and respond to the needs of producers. 
If they do not they would likely not gain re-election. 
The Ontario board does not have its own export credit program. 
The Ontario board does not have such powers. 
The government would guarantee to provide financial guarantees to the wheat board. 
The government would appoint five directors but the directors would be in a minority. 
The majority elected by farmers would clearly hold sway. 
Of course it comes under attack by our trading competitors. 
Its high rating among global buyers clearly makes it a threat to our competitors.  
At the same time the United States bashes the Canadian Wheat Board.  
With Bill C-4 we are doing the right thing. 
Bill C-4 deserves the full support of all members of the House.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
They told me clearly what they thought about it. 
Would it have to simply be 35%? 
They want some of the amendments we have put forward. 
Yesterday the government nixed all 48 of the amendments put forward.  
The second question ties in with the first one. 
It continues not to allow it. 
Why is the government hiding that information from farmers?  
We have been at this for three years. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have a comment for the member opposite. 
The minister was there taking the pulse of the producers out west. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Normally the process is for the questions and comments to come from the opposition.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Clearly they have not listened. 
We held hearings in western Canada. 
I was very fortunate to have attended those hearings. 
My question, because obviously the members opposite were not listening- 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
We are talking about Bill C-4. 
Those people are not in support of it. 
Maybe the hon. member did not hear me correctly. 
That is what we were talking about.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, it has been an interesting morning. 
I will tell members exactly why they are against it. 
I can list them, every single one, if members want to know. 
That is better than being a Liberal MP. 
They should start running to be elected to the wheat board. 
That is where the big bucks are. 
The farmers starve but the wheat board lives pretty well. 
That is why farmers are getting disgusted. 
That is why they are going to change the system. 
It will not take a government to change it. 
They will do it themselves. 
Farmers have done it before and they will do it again.  
Because of the secrecy and suspicion in it. 
Nobody trusts the wheat board anymore. 
Why do they not trust it? 
The farmers could dump it, burn it, do anything they wanted.  
David Sawatzky found a market for it. 
He got thrown in jail. 
What did he do? 
He went to the law books and he started studying law. 
He won the case. 
The government was not happy with that so it appealed it. 
He beat it again. 
That is why farmers are upset. 
That is why farmers are going to beat this lousy system. 
That is one example. 
I want to point out another example. 
What did they do to him? 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
What did they do? 
They through thousands of dollars of forfeitures against him. 
They took his truck. 
What did they do? 
That is how this Liberal government treats farmers.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
If the hon. member would like the documents, I can show them to him. 
I have them all in my office.  
Because he had to have some income, he took a tractor and a trailer. 
I cannot do it all by fork''. 
Do you know what the crown prosecutor did to this man, Mr. Speaker? 
Six months in shackles.  
That is not Canada, is it?  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
That is the Canadian Wheat Board. 
That is the Liberal government. 
That is the Canada we live in.  
What did the judge do? 
So they got rid of one more farmer.  
That is the Liberal government. 
That is not democracy. 
That bill is there for the government and the corporation. 
Stand up and vote against the government. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He is seriously wrong on that point.  
The member raised the issue of salaries. 
It is the paramount selling agency for producers around the world. 
It is a model which we should be emulating in other industries. 
That is a very efficiently run operation. 
What level does the member see as being efficient?  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
I will go a little further than that.  
And what did he say? 
When the RCMP looked into it they said ``He is right''. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
They admitted they were wrong.  
What is the government doing? 
It is in black and white.  
This book says there were $42 million in costs to operate the board. 
How much did it cost him to operate the wheat board? 
I do not think he made too much money on that deal. 
If I am right, he lost his farm.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I might as well be in Mexico. 
I might as well join the senator down there. 
The government is not listening. 
It would do as much good.  
That is very significant.  
Has the minister answered any of our questions? 
Therefore I went to some other avenues. 
I wrote him public letters and I never got a single answer. 
I might as well be in Mexico. 
I have worked very hard on this issue for a long time.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member is correct. 
I know he will not do that again.  
Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that I referred to the convenient absence of the minister.  
They never answered that question.  
The opposition out there in the three prairie provinces is horrific. 
I have already stated that and I will not go into it. 
That is blatantly false. 
I went to the farmers and the farmers talked among themselves.  
The farmers discussed the issue and came back to me with suggestions. 
Members know what I did with those suggestions. 
The farmers were willing to allow for a five year opt out clause. 
In fact the support was 83%.  
The minister said that both sides could not be brought together. 
How come I could do it? 
I have proven him wrong. 
He will not answer the question about who is supporting him. 
There is virtually nobody. 
What level of opposition is needed? 
Is it not abhorrent? 
We might as well all take a vacation in Mexico the way this government listens. 
It is absolutely ridiculous.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is not the government that did that.  
It is a matter for debate.  
This bill will create even more inequities. 
That is the point I am trying to make. 
It is their money. 
Whose grain is it? 
Who has taken the risks to grow it?  
That is happening in Canada. 
Mr. Speaker, you look at little doubtful about that. 
It is happening in this country. 
The farmers take all the risks. 
But they cannot own it if it is grown in certain districts.  
The farmers cannot own their own grain. 
Of course they cannot buy it back for the same price. 
This government is breaking that right. 
It is removing it from farmers. 
It is depriving them of the enjoyment of their property.  
It is not just on wheat and barley. 
Because farmers cannot control that, it devalues their land. 
That is happening in the prairies today.  
You have to know what the economy of the prairies is. 
You have to know something about crop rotation. 
Even the United Nations says it is wrong. 
All they are saying is ``We want to control our property''. 
That is what they are asking for.  
Could I get unanimous consent to finish my speech? 
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent of the House to conclude his remarks?  
The hon. member has run out of time. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Yet they do not table these documents. 
It was an untrue statement, a false accusation.  
Should they believe anything he says? 
The hon. member will address his remarks to the Chair, not to the hon. member. 
I urge him to be prudent in his choice of language. 
This is a $6 billion industry. 
This is absolutely untrue and they should be ashamed of themselves.  
I would like one question answered by the member. 
Mr. Speaker, I need one clarification. 
How many responses were returned?  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is having difficulty hearing the question because of the heckling. 
The question was fairly simple. 
If that is fact then why- 
Mr. Speaker, is it question and answer back and forth? 
I have put a question to the member and- 
Mr. Speaker, I hit a nerve. 
He will not reveal to us how many responses he gets. 
I will tell you what happened in my riding. 
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
We are clearly into a bit of a debate here. 
I do not think there is not a point of order. 
There is a disagreement about what was said. 
That is not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting. 
I wonder if this member is a lawyer. 
We know on the prairies how many are in favour.  
If that is in fact the case, is it not worth continuing?  
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Is there consent to extend the period for questions and comments?  
There is no consent.  
They do not allow open debate. 
They talk about it being a $6 billion industry. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In the circumstances I think we should resume debate.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
The Government of Canada is delivering on that request. 
Allow me to explain what these changes are.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think the hon. parliamentary secretary has the wrong speech. 
That is the one the minister gave this morning. 
We are trying to conduct debate in the House. 
They are reciting false standing orders. 
This is not parliamentary procedure.  
Why do members of the Reform Party not want to stand to debate the bill? 
Why do they insist on heckling? 
Why do they insist on interrupting the proceedings of the House? 
Why do they engage in such frivolous, irresponsible behaviour? 
This is my speech.  
We will hear it in a moment.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There is clearly a quorum. 
The Speaker can see a quorum. 
A lot of spurious points of order are being raised. 
There is a bill before the House for debate. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary has the floor and should be permitted to make his remarks.  
It is certainly an arduous task.  
Reform members opposite hold 57 seats. 
However only eight of them are currently filled. 
They will listen and respond to the needs of producers. 
If they do not, they will not likely gain re-election. 
That is the essence of accountability. 
They will have the power to select their chairperson. 
First, the directors recommend it. 
Balancing the exclusion clause is an inclusion clause. 
The request would be made public. 
The board of directors must then consider the addition. 
I will address these issues one at a time.  
This is a fact and one which the government will not dispute. 
Information in the hands of competitors can be quite dangerous. 
That is a good change.  
This is not to say that the Canadian Wheat Board is an entirely closed shop. 
It is not a closed shop secret. 
This annual report is public and is freely available to anyone who asks for it. 
These audited financial statements are also filed with the Auditor General of Canada.  
This is consistent with common practice in both public and private sectors. 
It is obvious they do not understand it. 
That positive idea comes from this side of the House. 
Let us talk about what the chartered accountant profession is all about. 
There would be no advantage to having the auditor general doing this job. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
That is what concerns them. 
They want the auditor general to look at the books.  
Did he see that information? 
If that information is being hidden from us, why? 
We have a right to know.  
I would like to make this point in conclusion. 
There is a way to solve the dilemma this government is in. 
Put Bill C-4 to the test. 
Put it before farmers. 
Let them vote on it. 
We have until the fall before the directors will be put in place. 
Is it not a good thing to do? 
I will point to some of the hon. member's comments. 
They cannot explain what those numbers mean. 
They have not tabled any documents.  
The truth is that I only saw 100%.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
There were 75% to 80% of the people who wanted a marketing choice. 
The people were there physically. 
That is pretty good polling I would say.  
Quite frankly we have to use scientific polling. 
We have a majority in this House. 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
After four runs both teams had the exact accumulated time. 
However, the importance of this medal is not missed by Canadians. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
If you cannot read and write well, how do you get a good job?  
I call on fellow members in the House to take our literacy problem very seriously. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
It is an issue of the Canadian people.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
It will use advanced technology developed in Italy.  
Congratulations to the two main developers, Marcel Pare and Rene Beaupre.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Recently I spent some time with some American senators and congressmen. 
When is the government going to fix this dysfunctional setup?  
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Our destiny does not belong to anyone but ourselves. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
After 30 years it may be time now to close the constitutional files.  
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
TRANSITIONAL JOB CREATION FUND 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Truly a sad day for democracy and property rights.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
This is what vision is about.  
Our government finds solutions for the problems facing us. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Since 1993 the civilian work force has been cut by over 11,000.  
What is the real agenda here, an efficient military or a privatized military?  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
The hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the issue of the supreme court reference.  
I have opposed this initiative for these reasons. 
I will never give up my fight for Canada.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
This decision is a sound and sensible precedent. 
It makes good law.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This country is not a balance sheet. 
This country is made up of human beings who believe in their country. 
That is what the Prime Minister has spoken about.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is the problem, the Prime Minister talks and that is it. 
He does not do anything.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is going down.  
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is the Reform version of the full monty.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is his vision for Canada. 
He made it abundantly clear in his speech today.  
My question is for the finance minister. 
Is that their vision for Canada? 
Is that what the Liberals are all about?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They are objecting to the country facing the modern economy. 
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously this case is being argued before the court today. 
Mr. Fortier argued yesterday that the court should answer those three fundamental questions. 
I am in complete agreement with- 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
She spoke about it two seconds ago; she speaks about it in the Toronto Star . 
So, we might as well keep right on.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister does not see any contradiction. 
Let me give her another example.  
That is a contradiction, is it not, Madam?  
Dear colleagues, questions must always be put to the Chair.  
Mr. Speaker, there are numerous legal implications to secession. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the government across the way has a big problem on its hands. 
Is that not yet another contradiction?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The secretary general has taken control of a series of proposals. 
We and other countries have been working very closely with him. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not correctly informed. 
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
There is a fundamental question of law here. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this is not a legal question, but a political one.  
What will be the next step?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can tell the House one thing. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
How does it believe the democratic will of Quebeckers should be respected on this matter?  
We want to make sure that this will not happen.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
This plays into the hands of the separatists and their new found friends.  
We do not believe in that. 
We strongly believe that Quebeckers and other Canadians will stay together, united.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
Yet Yves Fortier is arguing the opposite.  
My question is very simple:
Where does Mr. Fortier's mandate come from?  
These are serious matters.  
The first question, the most essential one, is this:
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my supplemental question is for the Minister of Justice.  
We need to know if this is true or false. 
International law does not give the right to secession within a democracy.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member said it was simply tabled in the House. 
We do not know.  
Unless and until the constitution is changed, that is the position.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about it dying on the order paper. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
We will see if he answers his own.  
The government is becoming increasingly mired in contradictions. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
They are therefore not subject to the Canadian Constitution''.  
That is one legal theory. 
We are submitting this legal opinion to the court.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the saga for us in the department of Indian affairs continues. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
From those recommendations we will act.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that investigator will have a full time job pretty quickly over there.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
I would like to ask the minister yet again which is it? 
The people of Canada want to know.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously the NDP is very confused. 
In fact a number of countries would agree with us. 
Failing that we would take a country specific exemption.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Therefore my question for the Minister of Finance is the following. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
He does not ask a question about unemployment. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The government's position is clear. 
The fundamental principle of the rule of law will apply to any secession.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
I would like to know two things. 
Is this the government's position? 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Why is the minister stalling on this? 
Can farmers plan now to plant industrial hemp this spring?  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
They asked him to present regulations to govern the commercial growing of hemp. 
An interparliamentary committee was struck and presented draft regulations. 
Since then there have been a series of meetings including- 
The hon. member of Calgary West.  
CANADIAN BLOOD BANK CORPORATION 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
What is the minister going to do to get our money back?  
I gather the hon. member does not like TAGS. 
Let me tell hon. members what one of the Reform members said. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we will try to dissipate the confusion somewhat.  
My question is very simple:
What is the minister saying in his speech? 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
A number of countries support that.  
Therefore, the exemption for culture for Canada is very much on. 
It will not be affected.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
For years the NDP has wanted to cut defence spending. 
We intend to do that.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
However that is exactly what his government did in 1995. 
We deal with important issues in this House every day. 
It is my country.  
It is far from being clear that Quebec is not divisible. 
I think the Crees and Inuit would have a very good case''.  
We need to know.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
More competition means more choices for consumers. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the announcement in question is simply that of something which is being renewed. 
He is afraid to look forward to the constructive- 
My colleagues, that will bring to a close our question period.  
I will entertain a question of privilege from the hon. member for Charlotte. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
He has 6,400 employees to provide him with the best information. 
He is not doing it for the critics.  
In chapter two under privilege it states: 
I would hope the hon. minister would take that into consideration. 
He could share that information if it would save some money.  
This question of privilege is finished.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I am not aware of this document. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
We will wait to see what the minister will say.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
That is absolutely false. 
That member should stand in the House and clarify that and apologize.  
The hon. member will know that is probably cause for debate. 
That will show on the record.  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
There is something here that does not compute. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
That is exactly what the Reform Party are asking for our competitors. 
We will protect the Canadian Wheat Board. 
We will protect Canadian producers, and quite frankly, we will have a more competitive environment.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
On a point of order, the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville.  
Madam Speaker, this is a red herring. 
That is not what farmers have been asking for. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is not a point of order. 
Will you conclude very quickly.  
Madam Speaker, I will resume. 
They want to be able to control the wheat board by politicians. 
We want to put it in the hands of producers. 
That is what this government states.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
They support the wheat board because the wheat board is being good to them. 
The wheat board has paid them a premium year over year. 
As a consequence, because they have benefited from the wheat board, farmers support the board.  
This ideology of the Reform Party should be discarded too. 
There are problems with Bill C-4. 
Bill C-4 proposes cash buying. 
It is true that we will have farmers elected to the board. 
What about the inclusion clause? 
The Reform Party goes on so much about democracy. 
Let us look at who wants to get rid of the wheat board. 
It is time the Reform Party put its ideology aside. 
Nothing is left to chance by the Reform Party. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is not a point of order.  
Madam Speaker, I am glad that some Reformer are listening. 
This is another tactic by the Reform Party. 
It is just a step along the way. 
Word was mentioned of grain days. 
There was a grain day hearing in Rosetown in my riding. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I listened to the rhetoric of the last few minutes with great interest. 
They are constantly analysing Reform Party policies.  
He did not express any of their concerns with regard to this bill. 
I have many articles from the Western Producer that he could read. 
An example is the MAI. 
We remain the only party in this House that is concerned about the MAI.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege.  
We are conducting debate here. 
It is very important that all members have the opportunity to debate. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I take note of your comments.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It is not privilege at this point.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
This is a sad day for the people of the prairies. 
They are fearful of the passage of the bill.  
What did he expect?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry but the time has expired.  
Agricultural economists looked at the issue from the perspective of their disciplines. 
Why does the member not accept that?  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-4. 
The proposed changes would modernize the governance of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
The answer is yes. 
In essence, farmer elected directors would enjoy a two to one majority. 
Only those who elected them would be able to accomplish this through subsequent elections.  
Why is the board of directors not 100 per cent producer elected? 
In addition, the CWB has public policy responsibilities. 
However, making this the corporation's legal objective would be difficult.  
This reduces even further the justification for involving the office of the auditor general.  
The proposed changes in Bill C-4 are balanced and fair. 
I want to share my time with my hon. colleague from St. Boniface.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
The member is from Ontario. 
Why would he have a different standard in this regard? 
It is more of a question I asked previously.  
He referred to an export licence. 
Has he ever seen that export licence? 
What are those three words? 
The member is from Ontario. 
You own the grain and you can export it.  
What does the member think about the form he referred to? 
How is he representing his constituents when he supports Bill C-4? 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague opposite for his question. 
I just thought I would answer that.  
The hon. member from Yorkton asked about the board of directors in his question. 
He compared it to Ontario. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
He did not answer my hon. colleague's question about it.  
My question is on a different issue- 
Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
I am not trying to get extra time. 
Madam Speaker, you can kindly add the time on.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Would the hon. member for Prince George-Peace River carry on with his question.  
He had no intention of answering the question.  
I have talked to people from the west. 
Not all people are represented by Reformers. 
I would like to put the facts on the table.  
At least 10 of the 15 directors will be directly chosen by western producers. 
The directors will have complete control over the activities of the Canadian Wheat Board.  
Bill C-4 complies fully with that wish.  
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
Another one, of course, is canola, which the member would know more about. 
Peas and lentils are pulse crops. 
Tremendous strides have been made in developing these crops as well. 
Oats is another one. 
Once the regulations were gone, beef just went through the ceiling. 
There has been a tremendous growth in that particular sector.  
We then have wheat. 
However, what has happened to wheat? 
This statement is from the wheat board. 
I would like the member to respond to that.  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's question. 
First of all, it is obvious that he has quite considerable knowledge in this area. 
I would like to answer him as follows.  
It just does not follow.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It is a very sad day for the wheat board. 
There are no fundamental changes. 
There is no question about it.  
That was on February 5. 
Why do we never listen to economists outside the wheat board?  
It is a sad day for our farmers. 
In my constituency we have three big projects going on. 
I want to mention the largest one. 
There is a group of farmers who grow the world's best durum. 
Naturally the best durum makes the best pasta. 
It is an absolute farce. 
It is a terrible thing to do.  
Let them answer that question. 
It is a crying shame. 
It is totally out of date. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have made one observation. 
Many of the members opposite have not answered our questions. 
He has the power to appoint that person. 
The Canadian Wheat Board is not the biggest problem farmers have. 
Farmers pay an inordinate amount of tax. 
They could save $25 to $30 a tonne by shipping it through Churchill. 
This is a very critical question which the government has left unanswered. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member has made a statement that is wrong. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid this is debate.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He said something completely different. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, in reply to my colleague, yes it is true. 
If it is cheaper it should be done. 
The farmer should get the money and not the Canadian Wheat Board. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There are 25 seconds for a very quick question.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
It was a sad day then especially for Western Canada. 
I want to quote a little bit from a column in the Western Producer. 
``They don`t mean to do harm-but the harm does not interest them. 
Harm is done by a lot of people. 
I suggest there are going to be a number of harms done. 
Of course, the history goes back prior to that. 
Imagine those dollars in terms of today's dollars. 
But it does not stop there.  
Nobody can get into it. 
It operates in secrecy and this bill does nothing to open it up at all. 
It is still in the control of the minister and executive council.  
So that is how they have lost. 
It was about a dollar a bushel over all those years. 
There is going to be harm done democratically as well. 
Alberta has voted to opt out, to set up a dual marketing system. 
We cannot do that. 
It will continue to be undemocratic in spite of the amendments. 
Shame on the government.  
What did they do? 
What did these western producers do to warrant a trip to jail? 
Prairie farmers cannot sell grain to the Americans, that is not acceptable. 
They pay way less in taxes down there. 
They are charged under a law that is absolutely confusing. 
Why should young people go into wheat or barley production? 
They do not even own it, really. 
It is absolutely a shame. 
This is a sad day for western Canadian farmers.  
It is a bill that should be withdrawn. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I will present one first and we will see if there is unanimous consent. 
Then I will present the second.  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
In other words, everybody sells to wherever they want.  
It should have been addressed to the Reform Party. 
That is a specific question and I would really appreciate a specific answer. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Yellowhead is not here to answer the question. 
Therefore we will be resuming debate.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We will be resuming debate.  
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
They never want to listen to debate. 
I have never seen a political party that is so afraid of the truth. 
The fact is that from day one farmers on the prairies wanted a monopoly. 
They wanted single desk selling. 
The sentiment and opinions of prairie farmers have changed very little. 
What is the fact of the matter? 
A Reform Party member is saying just the opposite. 
I want to touch on some other things. 
I wonder if members of the Reform Party would like to listen to some facts. 
We will see if they want to listen to facts.  
This is lesson number one for the Reform Party. 
This principle is clearly embodied in Bill C-4.  
Do not mislead the children now, John.  
Reform members do not want to listen. 
I know the facts really grate on them. 
When someone is given to ideology, it is very, very difficult to listen to facts. 
I will get into that more when looking at the specific recommendations of the panel.  
That is in Bill C-4.  
We are just trying to teach these little children a few things. 
I know it is very difficult for the Reform Party. 
It is very difficult but we on this side will not give up.  
That happens to be in Bill C-4.  
That is in Bill C-4.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have tried to restrain myself here. 
The member keeps demeaning other members of Parliament. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I will try to be more attentive to the debate. 
At this point I would like to request to see the ``blues''.  
Madam Speaker, I will see if I can just stick with the facts. 
That is in Bill C-4. 
It is just another fact.  
That is in Bill C-4. 
Bill C-4 follows that pretty closely I would say. 
The panel recommended that the first members of the board of directors should be appointed.  
The change in C-4 has been well received.  
Those are absolutely the facts. 
I dare any member of the Reform Party to try to refute those facts.  
The government did not believe that those recommendations were workable. 
Madam Speaker, how much time do I have left?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
You have three minutes.  
There goes the Reform Party again. 
It really kills them to listen, does it not? 
They take their business very seriously. 
They take the wheat board very seriously. 
They take the government seriously and they take politics seriously. 
The minister has done a magnificent job.  
Let us be absolutely frank. 
They belong to the mainstream. 
What they want is a workable bill. 
They want a bill which will work. 
That is simply not possible in this kind of world.  
I wanted to put those remarks on the record for the sake of facts.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will get to my question in a minute. 
I was raised on a farm. 
But that does not apply to Ontario. 
Madam Speaker, I would be absolutely delighted to answer that question.  
Two people can play that game. 
When we come to the House we all enjoy equal rights. 
We do not have a residency clause. 
The Reform Party simply does not get it.  
I will address the member's question about monopoly. 
He seemed to imply in his question that we did not address monopoly. 
I have another small fact for the Reform Party. 
They want an agency. 
They want the Canadian Wheat Board to sell their grain. 
Nobody can touch it. 
That has been shown.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
There is no doubt about that.  
The hon. member talked a lot about democracy. 
He mentioned democracy in his speech. 
To me democracy is the understanding that we have freedom of choice. 
Bill C-4 does not give us that freedom of choice.  
I have a very specific question for the member. 
What assurance is there in Bill C-4 of that?  
Madam Speaker, that is actually a pretty good question coming from the Reform Party. 
The answer goes something like this. 
Farmers know their business very well. 
They know whom to pick to represent their best interests. 
Would the member not agree? 
They do a pretty darn good job. 
Look at the growth of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. 
In this whole thing we have to trust farmers. 
They have good judgment, something the Reform Party does not seem to get.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I asked a very specific question, one that is very simple to answer.  
The hon. member is the parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture. 
He sits from time to time on the standing committee, as I do. 
How many farm groups would there be?  
I am there all the time, not occasionally. 
I am a full member. 
There is no such thing as a part time member of the committee on agriculture.  
Is that the question?  
They are the ones who are heard more than anyone else. 
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
I have a few comments to make. 
There is no question.  
Do as we say and we will get along just fine''. 
I do not understand that kind of thinking. 
It is something that I just cannot accept.  
In Canada there was no market at that point in time to sell that durum. 
He asked if he should take it across the line.  
What is anyone in their right mind going to tell this man? 
Nobody could argue that. 
I would just do that.  
I want to touch on the arrogance that we see from this government. 
They did kick out four Liberal MPs in the last election. 
Yes, I think they are relatively intelligent.  
They have not done that. 
The minister said they acted on all the recommendations.  
That is a far cry from the truth. 
That is what I would consider the edge of disaster for agriculture in Saskatchewan. 
We have problems out there. 
In my opinion that is a shame.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have been given the mandate to debate. 
He speaks about the politics of the community when there is a consensus. 
That will be difficult to find in this Chamber. 
That is exactly what I am saying. 
The hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt you have one minute.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the hon. member for Blackstrap.  
How does he explain that?  
Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question from my colleague for Saskatoon-Humboldt.  
I think that is part of the frustration that farmers see. 
That is part of that whole frustration.  
The wheat board is going to destroy itself.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I come from farming stock. 
My grandparents on both sides of my family were pioneers in the west. 
It just sort of gets into your blood. 
It is a matter of great service.  
When you complain about the farmers, don't talk with your mouth full.  
We all know the difficulties under which farmers operate. 
They have the vicissitudes of weather, the vagaries of government. 
They have the high costs of machinery and input costs of other kinds. 
Mr. Speaker, I will not read to the end of it. 
The question is on the amendment.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
No. You have 15 minutes now, and five minutes only- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
But before she begins, I would like to ask her who seconds the motion.  
The member for Laval Centre, Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral, seconds the motion.  
I would also like to thank my colleague from Laval Centre for seconding the motion.  
It appeared unthinkable that such genetic engineering could be used on humans. 
It was a first. 
This, then, is the context in which I introduce Bill C-247.  
As you might imagine, this purely voluntary moratorium has not been enforced. 
These are, they said, different fields requiring different frameworks. 
Need I mention that urgent action is required?  
However, there are a number of supporters of animal cloning. 
A clause in Bill C-47 prohibited human cloning. 
It is this clause we have incorporated in Bill C-247. 
The main clause of Bill C-247 reads as follows: 
No person shall knowingly 
(2) No person shall offer to carry out any procedure prohibited by subsection (1). 
Numerous questions were asked in this House to spur the government into action.  
I quote Louise Vandelac, a sociologist and specialist in this field. 
How should we react to the ``dematernalization'' of procreation? 
Our society depends on it.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in today's debate.  
That is the question for us here in the federal legislature. 
Most people here probably have never heard of it. 
It is an entirely unregulated environment.  
They could move to set up regulatory regimes to begin that process.  
Much work has already been done. 
It has to do with health issues.  
Who is the parent? 
Heaven knows what will happen in the future. 
We have heard it might be possible to have them implanted in a male. 
There could be a surrogate birth mother who is male. 
Is that science fiction? 
Given the rapid changes in technology nothing is impossible.  
Some exceptions and some reasons were identified.  
Gene therapy needs to be highly regulated. 
We may be able to say that cancers can be beaten. 
We may be able to cure hereditary diseases through gene therapy.  
Something else which was addressed in the previous bill had to do with research. 
We must ban anyone from profiting in the trafficking of eggs and sperm. 
We need comprehensive legislation. 
Many couples are desperate to have a child. 
We know that in some cases the results are questionable. 
We need balance to protect the individual interests of women and children.  
I thank the member for bringing this debate to the House of Commons. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Some play down the dangers of human cloning. 
Some say that a clone would differ from the original subject due to environment. 
Identical twins are not in fact identical in all respects. 
Having said all that, the dangers are real. 
The would be clone may be weaker, since cloning involves asexual reproduction. 
That of quicker aging also is a definite risk involved here. 
The technology that produced Dolly is far from perfect. 
From the very start that child would probably be viewed as existing for a purpose. 
There would be those kinds of expectations. 
It is not healthy for the child. 
Suppose parents would like to clone one of their children who is terminally ill. 
It is a cruel and destructive environment in which to grow up.  
That is another problem with the issue of human cloning. 
I support the intention of this bill to ban human cloning. 
To date, 19 European countries have signed an anti-cloning treaty. 
U.S. politicians are proposing permanent bans on cloning.  
It is insufficient to make human cloning illegal. 
We should go further in penalizing those who would ignore the law. 
We believe a fine is inadequate. 
With those constructive suggestions I indicate my general support for the bill. 
I will be trying to influence colleagues and others to that end. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
How many of us have actually said if only I had a clone? 
Imagine cloning in the case of the Minister of Finance. 
Is the world big enough? 
What would cloning do to the term double talk? 
What would it all mean?  
Give his DNA a few more codas. 
Bill Gates and Donald Trump? 
This is not a frivolous issue. 
It is not a flight of fancy of some far off technology. 
That point was made very clear many years ago.  
This is not a new issue.  
It has brought home the urgency of the situation. 
In fact we have had this debate in the Chamber many times before.  
We need to ban human cloning.  
There may have been some problems with the bill. 
We have had time to address those problems. 
We cannot afford inaction on this matter.  
Some 19 countries in the European Union have moved to officially ban human cloning.  
This tells me again that we are late in bringing forward legislation. 
We are behind the ball in terms of addressing some very serious concerns. 
There are many questions to be addressed in this area. 
The framework is there. 
We have the basis. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Madam Speaker, it has been an interesting day. 
I was on my feet earlier today on a question of privilege. 
I went back to 1980 to do my research. 
That is really what we are talking about.  
The commission established in 1989 was charged with looking at some of these issues. 
It is a highly technical bill. 
Unfortunately, that is not part of Bill C-247.  
It is time that we discussed this in the House. 
It is a debate that is worthy of consideration. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, do I have more than two minutes left?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
You have exactly two minutes left.  
First of all, I have taken full note of the debate this evening. 
I followed it from the lobby and in the House. 
I thank all members for intervening in the debate.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Scandal is the appropriate word.  
Is this truly in the criminal investigating tradition? 
Is there any likelihood of conviction? 
What are the reasonable and probable grounds that will even bring this to a charge?  
Sadly enough, this is only part of the continuing scandal.  
Here we are again. 
It is all talk and no action.  
I would like to pose some very serious questions that need answering. 
Who speaks for Canadian taxpayers on this issue? 
When this happens, Canadians will be allowed to finally see the truth.  
What is the government afraid of? 
The RCMP was and is responsible for this investigation. 
So that this would be perfectly clear, this point was repeated several times. 
It specifies that the letter is part of an- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Qu'Appelle.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Since then, of course, a lot has happened. 
We have had reports of bank service charges being excessive. 
We all know they are very regressive. 
They hit all Canadians in the same way. 
Whether wealthy or poor, people pay the same for a particular transaction. 
These service charges are regressive. 
Since that time, of course, we have seen a number of other things occur. 
We have seen the profit reports of the banks. 
The profits amount to $7.5 billion. 
Those are very high profits. 
There is no excuse whatsoever for them not to do that.  
The two banks are worth about $40 billion in terms of their stock market value. 
They have assets under their control totalling over $450 billion. 
That is a real shame. 
The doors will also be open for more foreign banking into this country. 
This merger should not go ahead. 
It is not good for Canada. 
It is not good for the future of this country. 
It should not be the Minister of Finance by himself.  
The government must approve the mega merger. 
The competition bureau has to approve the mega merger. 
That is what I am calling for in the House this evening.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We are firmly in control of this agenda. 
It does stand for approve the merger when it comes to the NDP.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Tuition fees are rising and federal funding is shrinking. 
The impact of federal cuts to post-secondary education are quite clear. 
What is the government's response? 
We have the announced millennium fund. 
Accessibility must be a new national standard in higher education. 
Principles of accessibility and affordability must guide any reforms. 
Student aid must be based on need rather than on merit. 
We do not need yet another scholarship program. 
Students deserve nothing less. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The Government of Canada cannot intervene directly in this matter. 
We do and we are taking action. 
Education credits have been enriched. 
The member opposite should wait until Tuesday to see where this government goes.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.25 p.m.)
