The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this afternoon will be a somewhat different afternoon.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I believe there is agreement in the chamber for that particular proposal.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I would be very uncomfortable with that kind of briefing.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I understood that there were three options on the table:
I do not think that that is his intention at all. 
In any event, he can put the question directly to both ministers. 
I presume that everything they will be telling us is in the public domain.  
Let us take the briefing in good faith. 
That makes the format even more mystifying. 
If everything is to be shared with everyone, let us share it in this room.  
He and I have had several discussions on this particular point. 
He did not insist on Committee of the Whole. 
He thought this was a fair start. 
That was my conclusion. 
That is why I suggest that we should go ahead and try this format. 
If honourable senators are not satisfied, then we will try Committee of the Whole.  
As honourable senators know, it happens that the ministers are available at this particular time. 
That information is also in the public domain. 
There he will attend negotiations with respect to the situation in Kosovo.  
Let us not distort what our discussion was about. 
My understanding is that this would be a briefing for senators only.  
No, it should be public.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
President Degn went on to say that: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to allow the honourable senator to finish his statement?  
In that statement he urged the Yugoslavia authorities: 
...to end immediately the campaign of intimidation and expulsion of the civilian population; 
to accept unconditionally the return of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes; 
to permit the international community to verify compliance with the undertakings above.  
He went on to say: 
State of Financial System-Budget Report of Committee on Study Presented and Adopted 
Tuesday, April 27, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Meeting Held in Niamey, Niger- Report of Canadian Delegation Tabled 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are accompanied by Mme Genevieve Gauchard, the wife of the French Ambassador.  
Welcome to the Senate, ladies. 
We are delighted to see that you are interested in our deliberations.  
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That would be an excellent idea, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the Honourable Senator Graham had asked that a document be tabled. 
Is it agreeable, honourable senators?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware that they will be deployed in that respect. 
They will be used, in the initial stages, to help in humanitarian efforts.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Not Sea Kings, I hope.  
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
As well, he will be meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov.  
Honourable senators, I thank the leader for that response. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
As I said, honourable senators, no conclusion was reached. 
Honourable senators, I could only presume that that would form part of the discussion. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I am not suggesting that at all. 
I am merely saying that all options are being examined.  
Therefore, the statement in the newspaper was correct?  
I have not had the opportunity to read that particular story.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I can only presume, honourable senators, that that would be the case. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I have a final supplementary question. 
One is hoping for peace in Kosovo in the near future. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, honourable senators, as a matter of fact we are. 
Earlier we envisaged accepting 5,000 refugees into this country. 
We are still prepared to take refugees into Canada on 72-hours' notice. 
We are ready to live up to that commitment.  
Perhaps my question was not properly phrased, honourable senators. 
Honourable senators, the answer is very much in the affirmative.  
Canada-United States Relations 
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Can he answer us today?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I went through the door and I indeed asked the question. 
I shall attempt to bring forward a more complete answer as soon as possible.  
Honourable senators, I am asking the question because this is very important. 
Last week, The Globe and Mail reported that "the satellite industry could be grounded." 
When it is not Minister Axworthy, it is Ms Copps. 
Americans will lose patience. 
Is the minister satisfied with this type of international relations with the Americans? 
Our prosperity and our security are intertwined. 
How can we improve this situation? 
I find it utterly unacceptable.  
That continues to be the case. 
Prime Minister Chretien and President Clinton have an excellent relationship.  
On the golf course.  
It has enabled us to bring forward a balanced budget. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
They agreed to postpone for 120 days the revocation of Canada's exemption.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this is a very serious matter. 
Honourable senators, I would be pleased to do that.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Douglas Roche on April 20, 1999) 
Therefore, there do not exist "statements" that Canada will submit to the meetings.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. James F. Kelleher on April 13, 1999) 
The Agreement provides for the possibility of convening impartial panels to resolve disputes. 
(Response to question raised by Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk on April 15, 1999) 
In signing the Rambouillet text, the Kosovars also committed themselves to this. 
Answer to Order Paper Question Tabled 
Francophone Summit-Application for Funding- Government Position 
Business of the Senate 
Honourable senators, rule 91 of the Rules of the Senate states: 
is the way in which we have structured our committees:
This rule does not exist in the other place. 
No such procedure exists in this chamber. 
However, there had been no notices circulated of those meetings.  
I thank the committee for issuing this notice. 
I disagree with that point of view. 
Honourable senators, I would appreciate a Speaker's ruling on this matter. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does any other honourable senator wish to participate on the Point of Order?  
Honourable senators, I would be interested in the Speaker's ruling on this question. 
We have recently re-established subcommittees. 
We in the main committee imposed no constraints. 
The subcommittees are allowed to meet whenever it is convenient. 
Honourable senators, there are many meetings going on around here. 
I will be interested in your response. 
He has been taking part in our deliberations. 
Any meeting of any committee is open to any senator. 
Meetings of the Internal Economy Committee are open to any senator.  
No decisions are taken in subcommittees. 
It is important to say that subcommittees are not decision-making bodies. 
These subcommittees are set up to facilitate our work. 
We have not done this lightly or without regard to advice. 
I will be interested in hearing the response of the Speaker. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
There is certainly an interesting point here. 
I will take the matter under advisement.

Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Both upheld the British traditions of criticism and self-criticism.  
The path of criticism is a public way...  
He wrote, at page 7: 
It was said in Scott v. Scott by Fletcher Moulton L.J....  
It is their duty therefore to be vigilant. 
Why not South Africa? 
And why those time-frames?  
I would have thought that his testimony was essential to consideration of this bill. 
This is most unsatisfactory. 
I shall give some examples.  
The pressure hasn't only come from The Hague.  
Friends and foes of a world criminal court:
These headlines are informative, strategic, and instructive. 
Justice Arbour is quite public about her political support. 
She is very strategic about where, and for whom, she places it. 
Her political rallying is increasing, not diminishing, honourable senators. 
Now she wants an army at her disposal - this is a judge! 
Justice Arbour herself is quoted as saying: 
Arbour vows to build cases quickly to ensure convictions," Aileen McCabe reported: 
These statements of and about Justice Arbour are self-explanatory. 
The righteousness or unrighteousness is not the issue. 
The fact is that such activities are not contemplated by Canadian law. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Cools, I am sorry, I cannot accept the statements that you are making. 
I do not think that that is a proper course in this chamber.  
What rule of the Senate can be cited that I am violating?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I cannot accept those. 
This is not an attack, Your Honour. 
I am relating what I am reading in the newspapers daily.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you citing from a specific newspaper? 
In that case, I would ask you to quote.  
I have been reading this matter for quite some time. 
This is not a particular quotation, but I am told - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
No one here can name a single judge on that tribunal.  
This court is of questionable origins and of uncertain jurisdiction. 
I submit that this court itself will be the first victim. 
Honourable senators, Senator Grafstein's amendments do not improve this bill. 
The definition of "entities" is wanting. 
These entities are listed in the schedule of the bill. 
Honourable senators, these are basic rights in criminal proceedings.  
What are sealed indictments? 
Does this entity tribunal protect the security of the witnesses called by the defence? 
We should hear from him. 
We should hear from some of them.  
It is simply not good enough for us to exist in a state of vanity. 
Honourable senators should know the issues.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I am sure the honourable senator will take a question.  
Can the senator be more specific, please?  
This was dealt with in committee proceedings. 
For example, clause 34 states: 
That is what I was driving at. 
The senator must be very specific. 
She says that we would allow hearsay. 
Of course, I would not support that.  
There are three exceptions, and in those three exceptions there is no reference to hearsay.  
I was not suggesting that the word "hearsay" was used. 
I am saying that that is the result. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I have a question on procedure. 
I should like to address a question to the Honourable Senator Cools.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the time period for questions has elapsed. 
Is leave granted to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Please proceed, Senator Grafstein.  
I am having a little difficulty following the thread of Senator Cools' argument. 
Senator Cools made reference to Rome and a recent statement of the minister. 
Do the senator's comments relate to future as well existing tribunals?  
I would be quite happy to clarify that for the Honourable Senator Grafstein. 
This is not something from my imagination. 
The bill itself says that. 
That is already in the bill.  
There are some other interesting things in that section. 
Paragraph ( d ) says "an international criminal court or tribunal."  
and it goes on to name both Rwanda and Yugoslavia. 
It even cites the resolutions of the Security Council which called them into existence.  
Senator Grafstein is shaking his head, but I am only citing what is on paper.  
I should like to address a more fundamental question. 
Honourable senators, I am saying no such thing. 
I am opposed to the concept of ad hoc tribunals.  
That is what is wrong with those tribunals. 
It is a selective prosecution. 
Once people are into the process of selection, who knows who gets chosen?  
Senator Grafstein, in a way, you are assisting my point. 
We have not heard enough on the functioning of this tribunal. 
We have heard nothing about the operations of this tribunal. 
Does anyone here know? 
Perhaps Senator Beaudoin knows the answer to this. 
Can that person cross-examine their accusers?  
Does that person have the right to choose their own counsel?  
Which authorities came before us on the bill and told us that? 
Were these questions put to those authorities?  
It is in the rules.  
Honourable senators, I am trying to follow the honourable Senator Cools' logic. 
Today you are my best friend, Senator Grafstein.  
Nuremberg is a great example. 
Nuremberg is a different kettle of fish. 
The Allied countries that were prosecuting took their evidence. 
This is the point that most people miss. 
In this particular tribunal, there is no such thing.  
You are dealing with ongoing conflicts. 
There is no victor; there is no vanquished. 
You are therefore reducing it to a selective process, and who decides?  
I read about it daily everywhere, and I hear the minister repeat it. 
I read the proceedings, because I was away. 
The minister reiterated, and I put it on the record again today:
The Security Council of the UN is mandating us. 
We must meet our international obligations. 
I also heard what the Russian delegates to the conference had to say. 
I know there is a sense of vanity that comes into this. 
I am impressed, Senator Mahovlich. 
Can you give us another one?  
The point is that we are not well acquainted with this subject-matter. 
Hundreds of thousands of people are being affected by this.  
I am quite in agreement with the Americans on this. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I have a question.  
I have not given much thought to any further action. 
Remember, I was away. 
Immediately on reading the debate, I went to the committee proceedings. 
I think that is a decision to be made collectively by all of us. 
I am still trying to figure out what I will do with this. 
Some of these questions could be answered quite easily. 
It is quite a simple matter, and I will think about it.  
I agree with him. 
That guidance which we are given by Beauchesne is very important. 
You have alluded to Madam Justice Arbour. 
I wish to thank the honourable senator for that question. 
Quite often, what we are talking about is non-substantial. 
We cannot deny that. 
That is in the public realm. 
I argued, if you will recall, in that vein.  
We have an opportunity, as senators, to study the issues. 
In addition to having an opportunity, we have a duty.  
I have read all of this. 
I know the sections. 
I am well acquainted with the Judges Act. 
I know that I am within my rights.  
We have an opportunity here. 
I will give the honourable senator's proposition some serious thought. 
On motion of Senator Pearson, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
UNFA must receive 30 instruments of ratification before it comes into force. 
Thus far, 21 ratifications have been received. 
The flag state has three days to respond to this notice. 
We must not allow our Canadian resources to be threatened in this manner. 
Hon. C. William Doody :
We face here a dispute which requires parliamentary attention. 
It needs 40 signatures. 
My honourable friend across the way tells me that we now have 21 signatures. 
Nevertheless, the Europeans are concerned about this matter. 
The conservation, belatedly, is long overdue. 
I now understand that he has more employees than the Department of Finance. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will return for the vote at 5:45 p.m. 
The sitting of the Senate was suspended.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
( a ) by replacing line 10 with the following: 
The Agency must develop a program"; and 
( b ) by deleting lines 13 and 14.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the question is on the amendment of the Honourable Senator Stratton.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion in amendment negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The question now before the Senate is on the main motion. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Report of Committee Adopted, as Amended 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, the debate on Bill S-22 has been very informative. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Therefore, honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator DeWare: 
( a ), by adding, after line 11, the following: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I believe that what Senator Kinsella wishes to do is amend the report. 
We are at report stage, not third reading. 
I have a question.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Perhaps we should deal with the motion so that we have something before us. 
At the moment, there is no matter before us.  
Honourable Senator Kinsella, you heard the deputy leader. 
Yes, that is correct.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion in amendment, honourable senators?  
Motion agreed to and report, as amended, adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill, as amended, be read the third time?  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, April 28, 1999 at 1:30 p.m.
