The House met at 2 p.m. 
CANADIAN EXECUTIVE SERVICES ORGANIZATION 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Surely Nelson Mandela will take his place among the greats of the 20th century.  
Stan Judd and John Mackillop are to commended for their efforts.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
It is the soldier, not the reporter, who has given us freedom of the press.  
It is the soldier, not the poet, who has given us freedom of speech.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
The member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Canadians are proud that today you walked among us.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
He has fathered a peaceful revolution, guided by his gentleness, wisdom and strength. 
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Despite their vows, the honeymoon does not seem to have lasted very long!  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
We have lived with them for a generation.  
The people of my riding have paid a terrible price for their nation. 
They have sacrificed both their lives and their health.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
We travelled to promote industry in my riding of Oak Ridges. 
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, today we have welcomed a true statesman among us. 
President Mandela is the very incarnation of the word statesman. 
with his great vision, integrity, and sense of what a state is all about.  
The Progressive Conservative members are particularly delighted with the visit of President Mandela.  
The visit by President Mandela bears witness to the strength of that tradition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Canadians want the truth.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, whatever happened to the concept of ministerial accountability? 
Whatever happened to the concept of prime ministerial acceptance of responsibility?  
He blames the protesters and now his spin doctors are smearing a witness.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The complaints commission is proceeding to do this.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
That inquiry cannot investigate politicians. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is providing material to the commission. 
He is just making a lot of noise.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Let me tell members- 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
I was not a member of the Mulroney government. 
Members of this government in opposition did not like this bill. 
Why have they changed their minds?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We all heard the question and I know we would like to hear the answer. 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Let the commission do its work. 
That is what the student protesters are asking. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Therefore the allegations made by the leader of the third party are totally erroneous.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
His denial is no reassurance.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the commission did not ask the Prime Minister to testify. 
So let us let the commission do its work. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wonder who prepared that question. 
Was it Mr. Landry or Mr. Parizeau?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Second, the commission has not asked the Prime Minister to appear. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Student protesters, Mr. Speaker, who are not going to get any legal representation.  
Who are they trying to protect?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
On what basis did the Minister of Immigration issue the permits? 
Did the Prime Minister's office ask her to issue them? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
We remember the Krever inquiry. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is a pretty cute answer coming from the solicitor general. 
There is no level of inquiry. 
That is what the Public Complaints Commission can look into. 
The hon. solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Last year, we brought them down 20 cents. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is not our choice.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I have a question for the minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions has already answered that question. 
He has said that the answer to that question was no.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
He is in charge, not Mr. Palmer.  
We want to know what the finance minister knew about this. 
If he does not know then what is he doing in that chair?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We are working with the industry to make this as easy as possible for producers. 
I again ask for the co-operation of the Quebec government in doing so.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I correct the hon. member. 
There has been no proof of the statement she just made.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The finance minister talks about choices. 
Will he do it today?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Let us make the right choice today.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is a program that has worked and will continue to work. 
We will stay the course.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member is suggesting we go back to a deficit position. 
But that is not our intention.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Regrettably the response was simply not good enough.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has been in the House for some time. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, frankly I had never guessed that an election might be undemocratic. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
They answer with respect to departmental responsibilities.  
That is not democratic.  
They have to live with the results of their irresponsibility.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The hon. member for Vancouver East.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have to reject the premise of the hon. member's question. 
The Prime Minister is a vigorous spokesman for human rights. 
He was the chief protagonist of the charter of rights and freedoms. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the unwarranted premise of the hon. member's question.  
That took a lot of guts. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is one supplementary question.  
I will look at it.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
The leader of the official opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Clearly we will be seeing the American response and acting accordingly.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This was said by Lucien Bouchard, the premier of Quebec, in August.  
The hon. member for Oxford.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is the international year of the oceans. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
That is absolutely incredible.  
Is this really the minister's position? 
Does he expect the Canadian public to believe this line?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I go back to the point. 
The hon. member simply does not understand how the Canadian system works. 
Mr. Dussault reports to the superintendent of financial institutions. 
We have separated politics from the administration of the public service.  
Consider carefully what Reformers are saying. 
They are suggesting that we should politicize the public service.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Disastrously low prices exist on our side of the 49th parallel as well. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Unfortunately, unlike the Canadian government, it does not give priority to Montreal.  
Despite the lack of a vehicle, we are continuing to- 
I am sorry, but the hon. member for Compton-Standstead now has the floor.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
They had her blessing.  
What is the truth?  
I think we are starting to reach a little bit much in our questions. 
If there is an answer from the solicitor general, we will hear it.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
All these bills are at the second reading stage.  
I believe this bill bears number C-53.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
OBSERVANCE OF TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE ON REMEMBRANCE DAY ACT 
Unfortunately in recent years it has been on the wane.  
BANK OF CANADA ACT 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions today.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present today.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
The hon. member I am sure knows that he cannot read a petition. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a number of petitions today.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I am presenting this petition on behalf of my constituents. 
I have another petition that I will table at another time.  
We will all look forward to that.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
There are no questions and comments associated with that.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
New tax treatments are, for the most part, similar to others already concluded by Canada. 
However, by necessity they do vary from one country to another.  
The rates on branch taxes and interest and royalties will be 5% and 10% respectively. 
Another measure I would like to discuss concerns non-resident pensions. 
Social security benefits will be taxable only by the country that pays those benefits. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Why was this bill introduced in the Senate? 
We find this very troubling indeed.  
Let me get this straight. 
Before my time expires I would like to move- 
The hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I move, seconded by the member for Langley-Abottsford- 
The hon. member cannot move a motion on a point of order. 
I believe it will be the hon. member for Langley-Abottsford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
There is accountability at the polls. 
What does it hope to achieve by that?  
I will tell members what it is going to achieve. 
I guess the arrogance of it all is starting to show. 
Maybe that's it.  
When is this going to stop in this House? 
This issue of the Senate is not going to go away. 
I can assure members of that. 
This is by no means a small issue across this country. 
This happens to be a very large issue where I come from.  
If it is so darn important then put it through the House first. 
My colleague is absolutely correct about the government's agenda. 
Bill S-16 from the Senate. 
There is a minister here. 
Now for my amendment. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise to speak to Bill S-16. 
We have a problem today with our dollar. 
I will point to one as well. 
We have the social union that is being considered by the provinces right now. 
We have the federal government balking at dealing with the provinces. 
They are bringing forward for the first time in a long time a unified proposal. 
Instead we are dealing with Bill S-16. 
It is absolutely unbelievable.  
I am talking about the Senate elections in Alberta.  
We have pointed this out before.  
They are friends of the Prime Minister and previous prime ministers. 
Today we had a great democrat speak in this place, Nelson Mandela. 
In Alberta today we are trying to hold a Senate election. 
He says the Senate election is a joke. 
That is what he thinks of Albertans. 
The Prime Minister knows that is absolutely untrue. 
He could not answer. 
It is absolutely disgusting.  
We will not leave this issue alone. 
We will pound away on the issue of debt.  
1. the hoist (eg. three months, six months).  
3. the referral of the subject-matter to a committee.  
Accordingly I must rule the amendment out of order.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
The Reform caucus supports the content of Bill S-16. 
It goes much beyond belief. 
It is no wonder that average Russians will likely always be poor. 
The bill makes an agreement with three countries. 
It hurt us all. 
Mutual agreement in fairness is the goal. 
How we get there in the process is also important. 
We do not agree that the bill should come from the other place. 
So far, none of these traits generally characterize the other place.  
This week was the first week for a few new senators. 
Who can blame any senator for feeling that way? 
Senator Thompson took good advantage, as have many others.  
My constituents would give me the boot pretty fast. 
But senators do not have constituents. 
They may say they do but it has become more of a figure of speech. 
In fact, it could very well be quite effective. 
It definitely has the potential, if it was reformed. 
We need to change it. 
I can honestly say that the work performed by senators was excellent.  
Her attendance and her work ethic in the committee was also very good. 
I know that Senator Cools was also appointed. 
I also know that the senator takes her job very seriously. 
I know he knows that is the rule of this House. 
It is in the standing orders of this House.  
He will want to be very careful in the words he uses. 
That is not the point I am trying to make. 
Senator Roche had the opportunity to throw his hat in the ring. 
He has also had the opportunity to honour his words.  
In one easy sweep the Prime Minister has thrown Alberta mud on democracy.  
The key word is respect. 
It is a word that Canada's Prime Minister must comprehend. 
Canadians are not willing to accept that status quo however. 
They believe in a strong Canada and believe in democracy. 
They do not believe in the old top down approach preserved by the Liberals.  
The hon. member for New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby has proposed an amendment to the House. 
Accordingly, I must rule the amendment out of order.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
I would like this to have been debated in this House.  
What are these tax conventions? 
Chilean companies also have branches in Canada. 
Tax conventions are based on a very good principle. 
Also, Revenue Canada stands to lose a lot of money in tax revenue.  
Let us take as an example a country like Barbados. 
This makes no sense at all. 
The gap is too wide between the taxation rates in these two countries.  
For the Bahamas, it is even worse: the taxation rate is zero. 
This creates a substantial imbalance.  
The maximum corporate tax rate was also 35%. 
Canada and Croatia basically have comparable rates.  
There is no big difference.  
They must make up this shortfall.  
But let us assume a 2.5% tax rate.  
The amount already paid in the foreign country is taken into account. 
This is not hard to understand. 
It is logical and it is fair. 
There are major injustices. 
The Department of Finance provides little information. 
Let us look just at the six major Canadian banks. 
A number of criticisms may be levelled at them, but this one is well founded. 
We need some hard answers.  
Earlier I explained how tax havens worked. 
The tax rate is very low. 
Of the 119 branches abroad, 57 are in the West Indies. 
Now that is really something.  
On the Cayman Islands, a typical example, the situation has not changed, it has worsened. 
That is just about one company per inhabitant. 
It makes no sense at all.  
That is the way it should be. 
Why do we pay him? 
Why is he there?  
I had my answer less than one year ago. 
There was also quite a bit of give in the labour policies. 
These are not necessarily countries with stringent labour laws.  
We are probably footing the bill for Canada Steamship Lines as well.  
There is something about it that bothers me and that greatly bothers the public. 
I can tell you that we will not drop this matter. 
Bill C-28 is a big, massive bill. 
The Minister of Finance owns such a company.  
What was the purpose of this change? 
The Minister of Finance tore up his shirt. 
You have seen him during oral question period. 
There is a risk of a slowdown in the economy. 
The number of jobs could decrease. 
Now, all the indicators point to a downward trend. 
The situation has changed since then. 
The experts now agree with the Bloc Quebecois. 
How can you expect changes to the tax system? 
I think we know the answer to that question. 
There is no willingness on the part of the government. 
The people opposite may be acting as judge and jury. 
Is it any wonder the minister is unwilling to review the tax system? 
We presented a document on personal taxes which included critical analyses as well as recommendations. 
The Minister of Finance said: ``Another serious exercise''. 
We can do without his praise. 
It took them a year as the deadline kept being postponed.  
Some recommendations are worthwhile. 
Others are absolutely worthless. 
The group submitted its report last year. 
The Minister of Finance probably put that report on a shelf or in his desk. 
I see that the minister was coasting. 
Business was good, so he surfed, he rode the crest of economic growth. 
He is still collecting and wants it to be legal. 
He has cut assistance to the poor and the sick. 
A real money machine. 
He could have plugged the loopholes in the tax system with respect to tax havens. 
But no, the Minister of Finance took advantage of the economic situation. 
Money was coming in and everything was fine. 
I remind you that we do not oppose repayment of the debt. 
At the moment, however, we have had three consecutive months of economic slowdown. 
In short, it means hardship.  
The minister should listen to the unanimous plea made by the premiers. 
That is all we are asking him to do.  
Having said that, we will support Bill S-16.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
This caucus will be supporting Bill S-16. 
It is a huge tax break for the wealthy in this country. 
This is just a reminder about the very significant shortcomings of Bill S-9. 
Currently we do not have tax treaties with these three countries.  
These agreements will override the Income Tax Act. 
This is apparently to be a short term provision.  
That is our strong contention. 
I will take a few minutes during this intervention to comment on it. 
We might ask why the support is growing for such a tax. 
There are two key political issues involved with putting such a tax into place. 
Collection and distribution of the tax revenue is a much trickier question. 
Compliance would depend on the banking and market institutions. 
That is not surprising. 
I would like to quote to you what he wrote in his 1992 report.  
I am referring here to Bill C-28. 
That outrageous stunt was discovered by my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. 
We do not question the competence and seriousness of this public servant. 
On the other hand, we know that tax agreements are nothing new. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
We engaged in a dialogue with the Canadian public in the most open sense. 
As such, we are supportive of Bill S-16.  
Those types of issues will become more and more relevant in the future. 
We are handcuffing Canadian producers and Canadian companies and individuals. 
We will continue to push for increased access to global markets from this party. 
I recognize members of the Liberal government have become born again free traders. 
Today even the New Democrats talk fiscal responsibility. 
It has become a buzzword.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
This is very important.  
Double taxation has often been seen as a real hamstring to our private sector. 
It also enables companies in other countries to work effectively.  
The government needs to address the aspect of taxation within our country. 
We need to look more carefully at research and development. 
Research and development is a cornerstone and a pillar of our economy. 
Education needs to be spruced up. 
This does not require a university education. 
This bill comes from the Senate. 
Senators have recently been appointed by the Prime Minister. 
The Canadian people could then decide. 
We would have a much more vigorous Senate. 
It is not relevant to taxation matters. 
Accordingly, I rule the amendment out of order.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
This in no way prejudices those who might come later. 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
She should be congratulated for her perseverance and dedication to this issue. 
They should be congratulated for taking such a very strong stand.  
Unfortunately the system cannot protect everyone all the time. 
Very seldom do we hear the word punish.  
They do not want to see these people on the streets again. 
I agree with them.  
Concurrent sentencing provides one sentence for multiple crimes. 
Virtually no regard is given to the lives of the individual victims.  
The minimum penalty always applies, even for the most prolific killers.  
For first degree murder the median has historically been 14 years. 
Kitty and her children will never have Vernon back. 
Life was life for Vernon.  
The predator has dealt a life sentence to the victim's family. 
It is that predators will be punished and punished severely. 
Some will argue that consecutive sentencing serves no purpose other than revenge. 
These two reasons together or individually are sufficient to justify consecutive sentencing. 
Criminals can rely on the system that orphaned the victims. 
Each life is valuable. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I try to see what exactly is the intent. 
This bill deals with the most heinous crimes. 
Therefore every member of the House should pay close attention to it.  
This is an extremely important question, and it deserves an answer.  
This provision deals with sentences for offences in general and not sexual offences specifically. 
However, this would take away some of the discretionary power of the courts.  
I have some concerns in this respect. 
I am in favour of the bill. 
We do it from time to time in certain pieces of legislation. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
The bill's summary clearly states: 
As I see it, you do the time if you do the crime. 
We honour them and offer encouragement.  
People should not just pay lip service to this statement. 
The bill is about reasonable and required change that every major victims group is demanding.  
Punishment is a detriment imposed for committing a crime. 
Bill C-251 would change that for the better. 
The lives of individual victims are erased from the sentencing equation. 
Let us support victims of crime. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
More free votes were to be allowed. 
The House can appreciate my scepticism.  
This example is but just one of the most recent. 
Later the then parliamentary secretary stated: 
Here again we have an example of the Liberals' paralyzing fear of the charter.  
Later on in his speech he added: 
The parliamentary secretary was speaking for the front bench of the government. 
Perhaps this private member's bill will help to correct that failure.  
Parole is based strictly on convictions. 
Multiple offenders would be distinguished from the one-time offender. 
He too was sentenced as though he had taken but one life.  
It is certainly a long way from providing sufficient protection within our communities. 
It is a long way from being totally honest with our citizens. 
However, I urge all members of the House to support this bill.  
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
I ask hon. members to consider that this is not really a partisan issue. 
We can play the usual jousting between both sides of the House. 
However, one thing we can agree on is the value of a human life.  
This bill is certainly deserving of an opportunity to be treated by the justice committee. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Thank you for that clarification. 
I do not believe this bill was born out of some idea of vindictiveness. 
In that context there is no need to talk about tying the hands of judges. 
This is not about revisiting capital punishment. 
I am very proud to be here today. 
I assure members it is a good bill. 
It deserves our support. 
Let us get the bill to committee and let us protect Canadians.  
I would like to correct that to Surrey. 
Surrey is my town and I cannot let that go.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
These are very positive suggestions the hon. member has made.  
This is something which all members of this House should encourage.  
The principles of sentencing are set out in the Criminal Code of Canada. 
Try explaining that to a victim of a violent crime. 
We must revisit the principles of sentencing. 
The suggestion by the hon. member does just that in a positive way.  
No one should be getting a free ride in our justice system. 
Sadly this is precisely what happens far too often. 
It is absolutely absurd.  
He should be serving 11 life sentences.  
However, we must look at sentencing carefully. 
Common sense must always prevail.  
Bill C-251 addresses this principle in a common sense manner. 
Therefore I support the member for Mississauga East and I support her bill.  
I am extremely proud to support it. 
I recognize the importance of consistent sentencing. 
If a judge says 25 years, it should be 25 years. 
That should be the end of it. 
That would give the offender and society faith in their justice system. 
Bill C-251 would be the best way to address cases of double murders. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
However, I still want to speak briefly of Bill C-251.  
What does it mean? 
What does it mean? 
I understand time has run out. 
I hope I have an opportunity to elaborate.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
We feel that is fundamentally wrong. 
I just want to give a couple of examples of that.  
We will not go into detail. 
This is absolutely bizarre and it is absolutely wrong. 
All victims should be compensated.  
We often blame the health minister. 
Water just runs off his back. 
Talk about being coated in Teflon. 
This Prime Minister is absolutely and totally coated with Teflon from top to bottom.  
Actually the human compassion and the need to compensate all victims- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the hon. member's time has expired.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is what the Canada Health Act is about.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I apologize to the parliamentary secretary but the time has expired.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted.

Hon. Gilbert Parent (Speaker of the House of Commons):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Today all that is changed. 
In South Africa, you are working to build such a society. 
You are rejecting separation based on race or language or religion. 
A new society for a new millennium. 
In Canada, in our own modest way, we have tried to do the same. 
While our goals and values are the same, our experiences have not been.  
Certainly, Mr. President, this is the inspiration of South Africa to the world today. 
Just as important, it is the inspiration that you provided to the world.  
It is often said that there are too few heroes in the world today. 
But today we are in the presence of a real hero. 
Your struggle was an inspiration to freedom-loving men and women everywhere. 
Mr. Nelson Mandela (President of the Republic of South Africa):
We will forever be indebted to you.  
Heritage Day is dedicated to the celebration of the rich diversity of our people. 
We do face major challenges and problems. 
The institutions of the new democratic order are dealing with the corruption in our society. 
We are all too aware of the great deal that remains to be done. 
We look forward to the continuation of this assistance.  
We expect this expansion to continue. 
We look forward to a reciprocal Canadian team in South Africa soon.  
Here too we look to Canada as a partner. 
They have forced themselves upon the attention of the world international community. 
Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, this occasion marks something of a farewell. 
Hon. Gildas Molgat (Speaker of the Senate):
Perhaps you would favour us with some advice?  
It indicated that your long 27 years in prison had not led to bitterness. 
Those were stirring words, Mr. President.  
Such expectations are difficult to meet. 
You are exercising a moderating influence on the world stage.  
Thank you for coming to Canada.  
Mr. President, be assured that here you are among friends.  
Mr. President, you have said: 
But if need be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.  
Many other honours were to follow, not the least of them the Nobel Peace Prize.  
Sir, you have kept your word.  
I choose my words carefully. 
You honour us who are here today. 
You honour the Canadian people. 
You honour this place, this House of Commons.  
All of us thank God for you having been with us in this world. 
You have made it, sir, a better place and we thank you.
