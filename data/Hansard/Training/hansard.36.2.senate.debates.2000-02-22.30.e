The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Bestowal by University of Toronto of Honorary Doctoral Degree 
Honourable senators, I know that none of you need an introduction to Archbishop Tutu. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have but four words remaining. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
Senator Forrestall : - scholarly Canadian defence publications.  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
I am pleased to report that both scouting and guiding are thriving in Canada today.  
Some 42,000 women serve as dedicated leaders.  
As well, he is presently an honorary officer of Scouts Canada.  
Black History Month 2000 
Halifax, Nova Scotia-Speech by Governor General 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
This is African Heritage Month, as I know you all know. 
In speaking of the history of blacks in Canada, Governor General Clarkson said: 
...all too often, this history has not been kind. 
Your Centre plays a role in this. 
And it showcases this to others. 
The wealth of your heritage is a great key to the future. 
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Adeline is from Vancouver, British Columbia.  
We hope that your week with us will be interesting and instructive.  
Sir John A. Macdonald Day Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canada-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Group 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday, February 23, 2000 I will move: 
That the Committee submit its final report no later than June 15, 2001.  
Future of Canadian Defence Policy 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Ban of Military Equipment-Statement by Leader of the Government 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
If not, will he retract his statement?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Replacement of Sea King Helicopter Fleet 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Could he give us an answer today?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, regretfully, I cannot give that answer today. 
Increase in Fuel Prices 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
My question, however, is for him. 
The trucking industry is suffering from high fuel prices. 
It is a crisis situation, honourable senators. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
One can sympathize with their position as they see their profit margins shrink. 
Subject to that caveat, though, this matter is clearly within the jurisdiction of the provinces.  
We can usefully urge those countries to release additional supply. 
Honourable senators, there are indications that this thrust is already taking place. 
Hon. W. David Angus :
All Canadians are getting is spin. 
My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I thank the honourable senator for raising that issue again. 
There are huge numbers and volumes of files. 
I indicated that I would make my best efforts in that regard. 
Indeed, this information has come forward, as the honourable senator noted in his question.  
Has the honourable leader read it all?  
The cover-up is not working, honourable senators. 
Hon. W. David Angus :
Instead of leadership, we have seen an abdication of responsibility. 
My supplementary question to the minister is this:
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
This is not the first time that an audit has been conducted at HRDC. 
One was done in 1991. 
Honourable senators, I think the minister is to be commended. 
She has been completely transparent. 
Yes, it happens occasionally.  
We were discussing the very question of HRDC. 
Honourable senators, as we all know, there was no Transitional Jobs Fund in 1991. 
There was no HRDC then! 
It was created in 1993. 
What about Ralph Klein and Mike Harris?  
Senator Boudreau : - received $31.9 million in his riding. 
I do not think he objected to his riding receiving a cent of that money.  
They gave it to Wal-Mart!  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
However, we can do that. 
With sufficient notice, I can retrieve the figures on every riding. 
Two ridings have been mentioned:
Winnipeg Centre and Vancouver East. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I can provide that information if anyone is particularly interested in it.  
I have no knowledge of the accuracy of that statement. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps I will rely on the opinion of others in this chamber. 
It is reported in that paper that: 
But the list shows - 
- therefore, someone must have looked at it - 
It is a good start, though!  
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
What is Canada's position on this extremely important issue?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for his question. 
Honourable senators, I respect what the minister has said. 
I am reluctant to give an undertaking on which I cannot deliver.  
Honourable senators, I can make that commitment.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I wish to return to the issue of Sudan. 
Could the minister tell us what that advice was?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I was not a party to any such discussions. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, the leader cannot deny it. 
The government would have known the situation in Sudan. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is in that context that I ask my question. 
People are asking what advice we gave to Talisman. 
Did they ignore that advice? 
Are they given this information? 
We talk about quiet diplomacy. 
Many are, in essence, government companies. 
I understand what the honourable senator is seeking. 
I am sure that that did not take place. 
Nova Scotia-Possibility of Cape Breton Becoming a Province 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Would the Deputy Leader please read that response?  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Noel A. Kinsella on February 8, 2000) 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Brenda M. Robertson on December 7, 1999) 
The Government of Canada has heard their message loud and clear.  
Provinces recognize the importance of helping communities to find solutions to deal with this issue.  
These enhancements to existing programs are not dependent on negotiations with the province. 
Funding has already begun to support projects in communities.  
No Canadian should go to bed hungry or without a roof over their head. 
Moreover, TD has indicated that it will respect legislative requirements. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
He is known to be competent, gentlemanly, and to the point.  
However, he used the word "misleading". 
Hon. W. David Angus :
Honourable senators, he has been out in the sun too much.  
Poulin (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Honourable senators, the Speaker will take the point of order under advisement.  
Leaving having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Wednesday, February 23, I will move: 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
One of the difficulties confronting the Senate is that people are not listening. 
The debate is underway, but the decision has already been made. 
I came to the conclusion that there is a danger. 
I did not go as far as she did in my research. 
We learn a lot by listening to her speeches and rereading them.  
Senator Lynch-Staunton wants to change the way Royal Assent is declared. 
I have no objection in being corrected if I am wrong. 
I pay tribute to Senator Cools' remarkable work. 
This is also the case in the front row of the opposition. 
I note that Senator Maheu and Senator Gustafson, among others, are present. 
Increasingly, we are heading toward a rift between the two Houses.  
It is a kind of slow-but-sure cut between the two chambers. 
What, then, is the real problem? 
How can we come to a harmonious conclusion without hurting anyone's feelings?  
It is in the process, I believe, that we may be wrong. 
I grant that Senator Lynch-Staunton may not be attacking this issue head-on. 
I will make one myself.  
Senator Lynch-Staunton wants the Royal Assent ceremony to be done differently. 
It should be pre-announced. 
The ceremony should take place on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, at a fixed hour. 
I also believe that the government should adopt a certain discipline. 
It should remain a major ceremony.  
Our duty is to decide whether to propose amendments. 
We are sometimes told we should be more active. 
I will brag and say I am. 
My determination is to keep tradition. 
I am extremely hesitant to move away from tradition. 
There are people at the moment who would like another tradition. 
When one thinks about it, one wonders why not? 
It is not that way for me.  
Honourable senators, I have a suggestion. 
I do not think we have taken enough time to reflect.  
I have been through this in the House of Commons.  
I was chairman of the members' services committee. 
There are many services for parliamentarians that they do not even know about. 
They invented a monstrous committee, which now has problems. 
I am afraid that once we cut the tradition, it is finished. 
It can hardly come back. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Senator Prud'homme's time for speaking has expired. 
Is leave granted, honourable senators, to extend the time?  
I would also submit what I would describe as a parliamentary phenomenon.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Senator Cools, you have been granted permission to ask a question.  
That is what I am doing.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Would you ask the question, please?  
I am sorry, Senator Lynch-Staunton, but you did this before. 
I should like the Honourable Senator Prud'homme to respond to my question. 
Come now, honourable senators, this is pretty transparent. 
Surely honourable senators can do better than that.  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
I wonder if the honourable senator could repeat her question.  
Thank you so much. 
With leave, I would be more than happy to repeat my question.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Thank you, Senator Cools.  
I am eagerly anticipating Senator Prud'homme's response.  
I always want to pay homage to hard-working senators. 
I always come away from a debate with her a little richer. 
I could do without the impatience when someone is a hard-working person. 
Honourable senators, the points that have been raised must be taken into account. 
There is no doubt in my mind about that. 
The debate goes back a long time. 
I had the material sent to me when I was absent. 
I read what the honourable senator said, as well as the other recommendations. 
I suggest honourable senators read that as well. 
The report can be obtained for free on the Internet.  
Royal Assent has always been done at a moment's notice. 
Honourable senators, as long as my country has existed, it has been very well organized. 
Honourable senators, I believe in evolution. 
However, evolution does not mean we should get rid of all of our traditions. 
I consider one of our traditions to be Royal Assent. 
In the name of efficiency, we are killing something which exists. 
That ceremony did not take place.  
Honourable senators, I was there as a member of the House of Commons. 
I did not raise the matter.  
Honourable senators, this is a very serious matter. 
Honourable senators, one senator could have embarrassed you again this year. 
I could have expressed my dissent, and we would have had to debate the issue. 
This could happen again. 
If the two Houses work together, this situation will never arise.  
I will ask Senator Cools to do all the research on this matter. 
I know that Senator Cools will tell me whether or not I am correct.  
We should not have preconceived ideas. 
I will make one last appeal. 
However, I have not had an occasion to do that. 
That is why I say, "Let us modernize." 
You never know what might happen.  
I leave that with you for your reflection.  
However, I wonder if it can be done as a test case. 
If it does not work, we will have to find other ways to do it.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
A number of questions arise here. 
He also referred to proposing another kind of Royal Assent. 
He referred to accommodating some differences. 
Ideally, that question should be dealt with by our committee.  
That is the appropriate forum for that kind of debate. 
- or not pass from the House.  
That is one of the options. 
The authorities are clear that the Royal Consent can be obtained at any stage. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
It was most educational, instructive and very helpful.  
I believe we are all in agreement on that.  
A certain prestige was added to the ceremony by the attendance of those key figures.  
Honourable senators, would the honourable senator allow one question?  
I am a democrat. 
I believe in the free flow of information and in study. 
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order.  
Honourable senators, Senator Cools is correct. 
Following that, I am sure Her Honour will put the question.  
Obviously, it must be understood that we have to move second reading first.  
Its purpose is simply to change the manner in which it is exercised. 
The principle of Royal Assent stands, but the ceremony would be performed differently. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
That, indeed, is my first difficulty with this bill. 
At that meeting in Vienna, Ms Robinson went on to say: 
They are transnational both in scope and effect. 
The group may well include those with genuine claims to refugee status. 
A report on that visit is anticipated imminently. 
We would be prudent to avail ourselves of their wisdom.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
Public Service Whistle-Blowing Bill 
Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton ). 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I wish to make a few comments on Bill S-13. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Parliament of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton ). 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Grafstein is unavoidably away from the chamber. 
He has asked me to move second reading of Bill S-5.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt to motion?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
This measure attempts to address that and, in principle, we support such an initiative. 
However, the bill has an error in it. 
For greater certainty, where a court charges an offence under section 220, 221 or 236 - 
The courts do not "charge" anything under our system. 
That word obviously is incorrect. 
If you read the French, it states: 
Lorsqu'un chef d'accusation vise une infraction prevue aux articles 220...  
I draw that to the attention of the chamber. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Order Stands 
Honourable Senator Di Nino ). 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, may I ask a question? 
We have now moved the bill of Senator Lynch-Staunton forward. 
There is a great interest in this bill. 
However, is it not possible to send this bill to committee today?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Sheila Finestone rose pursuant to notice of December 16, 1999: 
The Canadian group is a member of two caucuses, which is quite unusual. 
It is my privilege to serve on the Twelve Plus executive committee. 
Parliamentary delegations reflect the political spectrum of each national parliament. 
Many of these programs and studies are aimed at enhancing democracy. 
The IPU undertakes many studies and publishes statistics on worldwide interests. 
That document has just been made available and is being distributed worldwide.  
The Inter-Parliamentary Union has an important relationship with the United Nations. 
Therefore, parliamentarians should be better informed. 
Legislators were able to define and discuss important issues. 
I will now discuss some of the highlights of the Berlin conference. 
They are issues of concern in the making of our own Canadian foreign policy.  
It included such issues as anti-personnel land mines and the International Criminal Court. 
Thus far, only four countries have done so. 
It is available through my office if honourable senators would like to read it. 
I think you will find it worthwhile reading. 
A lively debate took place and a very interesting resolution was presented. 
This time, there were over 350 votes in favour of this particular amendment. 
It became an emergency debate. 
Senator Joan Neiman helped establish that committee. 
She had visited many countries of the world. 
We Canadians in the IPU continue this work. 
We meet with ambassadors from the various nations and we speak to leaders. 
That is quite a change. 
I am pleased to report that we have a new president, Dr. Najma Heptulla.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable Senator Finestone, your 15 minutes have expired. 
Do you seek leave to finish your presentation?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Dr. Heptulla is the deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of India. 
She was elected as president of the inter-parliamentary council this last term. 
She stated that her selection was: 
I hope we will have an interesting debate in that regard. 
In conclusion, I underline the important work undertaken by parliamentarians at these international meetings. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
Financing of Post-Secondary Education 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins rose pursuant to notice of February 8, 2000: 
Fewer jobs are available to those with lower levels of education. 
Still, students drop out before finishing high school. 
This makes no sense. 
These problems are severe and threaten the competitiveness of Canada in the international arena. 
Therefore, what can be done?  
Honourable senators, the school curriculum must be reviewed. 
Programs are innovative, with the emphasis on success. 
In recent years, universities with which I am familiar had partnered with corporations. 
In many ways, I believe we were deluding ourselves even then. 
Summer jobs were also more plentiful. 
The first thing that must be done is to eliminate the taxable status of scholarships. 
It will require imagination and a commitment of substantial resources. 
This continued as long as satisfactory progress was made in university. 
Now is the natural time to study the implementation of such a plan. 
Now is the time for the federal government to make its presence felt in - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to interrupt the honourable senator, but his 15-minute speaking period has expired. 
Is leave to continue requested?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The banks are not happy because they are not making enough money. 
How ridiculous can matters get?  
What is the problem that is causing the banks to approach the government for aid? 
What is the government's answer? 
The student does not see a dime.  
Approximately 75,000 veterans benefited. 
This is a needs-based program. 
Students in need will be helped. 
Those who are not need not apply. 
The educational institution would benefit as well, as it would receive the grant money immediately.  
Then and only then would interest be charged. 
An Alternative Guide to Canadian Post-secondary Education". 
The federal government should demonstrate both vision and political will in this area. 
On motion of senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, February 23, 2000, at 1:30 p.m
