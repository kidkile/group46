COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
The petitioners call upon parliament to enact such legislation.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
Mr. Speaker, I am particularly interested in this topic. 
Since 1987 we have had a great deal of these research meetings. 
In the initial stages we always talked about technological issues. 
We needed better case tools. 
For the most part those issues were addressable.  
One of the participants gave an interesting example. 
IBM was there to sell its new commerce server. 
The second point raised in that discussion was the issue of leadership. 
There is an interesting conundrum throughout the world and certainly we see it here. 
I am not the oldest member in this House. 
I suspect there are lots of examples. 
My son is four years old. 
He has been using his computer for a year and a half. 
I say that without wanting to be too facetious.  
There is almost an equation. 
I remember once a gentleman was highly frustrated. 
I pulled him back from the computer and told him to relax. 
He said he could not deal with computers. 
I asked him what he did. 
He was a jet pilot, a brigadier general in the Israeli air force. 
However, his interaction with that box angered him.  
We see in it some traditional fears about change. 
Will there by disillusions? 
Anytime we produce a change in the market there will be some disillusions. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member because he is in full flight. 
There has been enormous consultation. 
This has been worked on for years. 
People outside Canada are amazed at what Canada has been able to do. 
The minister is a representative of the department. 
I want to come back to the issue of the legislation in general. 
The detailed legislation has been talked about by the minister and others. 
It is available for everyone to see. 
In thinking about electronic commerce, there is a very real example.  
That is the piece of equipment on which the transaction is completed. 
The money is transferred to the vendor and the good is transferred to the seller.  
It is where the bills have changed hands. 
It is located in one province. 
I am calling up a server that is located in London. 
I pick up the article I want. 
The article makes reference to a book. 
That sale is cleared by a Visa clearance office in Vancouver. 
That is not in the future. 
Who pays the tax? 
How are we taxed on that? 
It becomes global because information is no longer static. 
It will reside in Europe or in China.  
Walking through the basement of Westminster I saw a bank machine. 
It shocked me that they could clear that thing so quickly.  
It is to all our benefit.  
We need to be careful. 
We do not want to impose a heavy handed regulatory environment on commerce. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
He also wants to see commerce protected. 
It is a balancing act that may be problematical.  
There is one practice we see regularly. 
I would like the hon. member to clarify this.  
But I am practising and I will soon.  
The member raises two really important points. 
The member is absolute right. 
It is a sale. 
I have a blue card in my pocket that we use in my province. 
There are 10 principles in the bill. 
Accountability is the first one. 
An organization is responsible for personal information under its control. 
The organization now has a responsibility.  
I invite members to go on to the Internet and look. 
This legislation gives the control over your information to you. 
The choice rests with you.  
The other issue where the difficulty lies is the balancing act. 
We have experienced a number of dreadful examples. 
They limit the ability for organizations to be innovative. 
They limit the ability for pricing to move quickly. 
There are a lot of negative consequences that come from that.  
That will be very much part of the debate.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Where will this place us in the world community of competition?  
I am not being extreme. 
Always we have to sit somewhere in the middle.  
It is in the interest of everybody. 
The bigger the system, the more people who play and the better it will be.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
This is one of the weaknesses of the bill.  
This Act may be cited as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. 
This is another problem with this bill. 
But, as we can see, this knee-jerk response was not adequately prepared. 
It would not be in their best interests. 
Again, it is essential. 
We could also mention the case of children who use computers. 
This is fine but we already know that confidentiality is not guaranteed.  
I read the documents and the information that were circulated at the meeting. 
Indeed, transactions ought to be taxed. 
That is something the GST is trying to take care of. 
This must be dealt with.  
I appreciate the international considerations involved.  
In Quebec, we consider trade to be a provincial jurisdiction. 
I would draw to the House's attention to clause 5(2). 
This caught my attention. 
I then turned to the schedule, and the word ``should'' is just about everywhere. 
Would a given sector deliberately set out to cause itself problems? 
``But that it is what a recommendation is'', they counter.  
Now I have seen everything. 
I do not think legislation like this is long for this world. 
He is candid enough to admit that, and rightly so. 
The party over there did not do its homework. 
This is not the usual way of doing things. 
Yes, there is an international dimension.  
I will make an aside here. 
I agree international organizations should be involved.  
Yes, there are international dimensions to it, and yes this needs to be watched. 
It would be out of the control of the countries involved. 
For 20 years in some cases and 10 in others.  
I think there is some truth to what he says in this case. 
Why will it take a while? 
Because the interests of the OECD countries vary. 
However, they are not the poorest countries. 
Even the richest countries have reservations. 
Are they about protecting the ordinary citizen internationally? 
Parliamentarians can do that.  
The governor in council, as we know, is cabinet.  
I gave the example of the question of the member for Chambly earlier. 
We have computers and systems that allow us to do transactions and e-commerce. 
This is a new venture. 
It is high technology. 
Every type of organization is included. 
But we will monitor the situation.  
He reviewed the bill and he thinks it makes no sense. 
This was the substance of my comments.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
It was certainly an eye-opener for me. 
It will undoubtedly set a precedent in the House.  
I am somewhat surprised. 
That would be a far better description.  
I would like him to give us his views on this.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
He probably knew I could respond. 
In fact, I have a quote and I hope he will find it satisfactory.  
About the CSA code proposed by the Canadian Standards Association, it says: 
There is good reason to be pleased with the Canadian industry adopting such a code. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to say two things in one minute. 
That is one of the problems. 
I would be willing to make the correction. 
The title of the bill talks about promoting electronic commerce.  
That is not what they are trying to do. 
It is something else. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
We must be visionary. 
Trust is at the centre of this entire exercise. 
The issue goes well beyond the boundaries of the industry department. 
The list goes on and on.  
These global forces are shaping our economy. 
One Canadian executive made an interesting observation on the issue. 
I think it bears repeating in the House. 
Many industries are immune to Internet competition. 
Incentives are a very intricate balance in the marketplace. 
Some are intrinsic such as the desire to be self-employed. 
Some are dominated by quality of life issues. 
People can choose where they work and where they shop. 
The law of unintended consequences kicks in as government policy kicks in. 
Tentatively I wish to commend him on that position. 
By and large I suspect these taxes are not being remitted.  
This is not an insurmountable problem, however. 
At issue is the interim situation. 
This situation should be addressed sooner rather than later. 
Fairness must come as an inherent fundamental cornerstone in tax policy.  
I have dealt with a purely domestic Internet tax issue. 
Now I want to turn our attention to taxation in the international marketplace. 
There was fundamental agreement in five following areas.  
The third was certainty and simplicity. 
This would ensure that taxation levels and collection procedures are transparent and predictable.  
The fourth was effectiveness and fairness. 
These principles seek to equalize a world of incongruent tax regimes. 
However that is not the world we live in today. 
If we tried to negotiate such a treaty it would take a long time. 
It would be a very long and arduous process. 
The House is charged with the duty of protecting and fostering Canadian interests. 
It is not about to turn its back on free trade.  
However, we must be realistic about the competition that exists out there. 
The cold reality is that Internet commerce cannot help but be brutally efficient. 
Price as a determinant will become the overriding decision maker in the Internet.  
The commission has been vilified for this and has been accused of empire building.  
In fact, quite the opposite is the case. 
The subject of global e-commerce should not fill us with fear. 
Many people would urge that we move in a Luddite way. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This seems like a good point to interrupt.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for Kings-Hants for his speech. 
It is important that we not set narrow goal posts. 
We must look at it in the global context and we must be leaders.  
I know that about 36 sectors have been mentioned already. 
Interprovincial trade barriers cost Canadian jobs in a tradition sense. 
He does not have to be in Toronto, Boston or New York.  
I would appreciate the member's feedback on this. 
I agree with him 100%. 
But maybe he should have talked about it last weekend at his conference. 
Electronic commerce can be anywhere in this country. 
Travel is very quick. 
Movement through the Internet is very fast. 
That is the advantage we are going to have in this country.  
When that happened there was a very active policy and legislative agenda. 
These changes led to this government's ability to eliminate the deficit.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will now proceed to 10 minute speeches without questions or comments.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
So, this was the purpose of the federal government's strategy.  
Then, the whole matter was transferred to the industry minister. 
It was decided that all that was needed was an act to promote electronic commerce. 
The protection of personal information was no longer an important issue to be dealt with.  
This is a type of electronic transaction.  
Both e-mails can be read by your employer. 
Likewise with the drugs you purchase.  
These things have an impact on our daily lives. 
We are not the only ones to think this way. 
The report raises an important issue. 
But the federal elephant has given birth to a mouse. 
This report has been totally overlooked. 
This is therefore a very important issue.  
But that is not the message the minister is conveying. 
It must be resolved.  
There was far less consultation of consumers.  
It is therefore not acceptable to us.  
This is one of the things that is different about our society. 
The commission specifically said ``the only response that is respectful of the rights of citizens''. 
It did not say ``one of a number of respectful responses''. 
It appears to me that the legislation before us is a botched job. 
But it will affect people in all manner of daily transactions. 
More and more people are providing information about themselves.  
There is some imbalance here. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
There is no consent.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
I know he had some interesting and important things left to say.  
I find it also regrettable that certain members of this House refused consent. 
They do not realize the importance of the issue. 
We look at the cost and pay the bill.  
This bill, I repeat, provides the illusion of protection. 
It is not there to protect personal information. 
Protecting personal information is only of secondary importance. 
Your transactions will not be intercepted. 
You do not have to fear that the information you will give might be disclosed. 
Unfortunately, reality is quite different. 
The main part of this bill is contained in a schedule. 
Some things are appalling. 
We talked about this on Monday. 
This act makes Quebec a leader in this area.  
This bill should be withdrawn. 
This could only enhance electronic commerce.  
Things have been turned upside down. 
We are not asking the minister a favour. 
But it is more than that. 
As we all know, federal laws often have precedence over provincial laws. 
This is a major problem. 
The government thinks it can help electronic commerce by giving illusions to consumers. 
This will not work. 
Its objective is to promote electronic commerce.  
Quebec took the lead in this area four years ago.  
Members do not want that, I do not want it. 
Quebec already has a responsible law.  
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Our caucus opposes Bill C-54. 
I intend to articulate the reasons for that later.  
First it is worth talking about what is electronic commerce. 
A host of commentators of all sorts have heralded the immense possibilities of electronic commerce.  
It is true that the Internet is a very difficult medium to regulate. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
I will try to explain. 
This was a first among North American states. 
Companies will not be able to meet the requirements''. 
Yet, the legislation is working. 
This has several consequences. 
Moreover it has another consequence which is totally unacceptable in Quebec. 
My colleagues mentioned it, but it must be said again. 
This is extremely annoying.  
Therefore this is totally unacceptable.  
We cannot risk covering some organisations and leaving others aside''. 
He says: ``It is not an unlegislated area''. 
The minister is in a position to stop the inequities and inefficiency. 
He has to act. 
We will be happy to applaud him. 
Must one go to court? 
Not everybody can afford that. 
It is practically non-existent.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member but her time is up.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
She did so for the employment insurance. 
She did so for the special legislation on the rail industry. 
At this moment, I ask you to refrain from laughing. 
How blurry can you get? 
How far can you go to confuse things. 
What is the message we get from this bill? 
What are we to understand as legislators? 
This does not make sense. 
This is no trifling matter, when one thinks of it. 
Let us take the example of an employee at Eaton's. 
This employee works at Eaton's in Montreal. 
Would it be the case if Bill C-54 was in effect? 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The purpose of this bill is to protect personal information. 
Bill C-54 is a very timid bill. 
So he would lose that right.  
Fortunately, the RCMP had foreseen this. 
This government will invest more than $2 billion in education. 
The Prime Minister misused his power. 
I think that this man can sometimes be dangerous. 
We must not give him powers. 
The next day, he said that the RCMP could have used water cannons instead. 
Where is the government leading us? 
To a dictatorship perhaps? 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Most provinces have already passed such legislation. 
First of all, I must stress the fundamental nature of the right to privacy. 
Section 7 reads as follows: 
5. Every person has a right to the respect of his or her privacy.  
This is from Quebec's charter of human rights and freedoms. 
I urge my colleagues opposite to listen carefully. 
Section 35 reads as follows: 
Every person has a right to the respect of his reputation and privacy. 
The situation in Quebec in this regard is particularly exemplary. 
It would have achieved two objectives at once. 
First of all it would have ensured consumers would have top-notch protection. 
This, however, is totally wrong. 
Instead, it serves commercial interests.  
I just referred to the privacy commissioner of Canada.  
In conclusion, one simply needs to compare the titles of the two acts. 
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve did it in an eloquent way earlier. 
Such power simply does not exist in the federal legislation.  
It is for these reasons that we categorically reject Bill C-54. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Of course, this may be required for certain reasons. 
The fewer the restrictions, the bigger the profits.  
But privacy is still important. 
Some would say ``He who pays his debts grows rich''. 
Clause 7(1) says this, and I quote: 
There is no problem with that. 
I think about Equifax. 
That is the danger.  
Paragraph (c) says this: 
(c) the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic or literary purposes.  
We can live with that. 
And it goes on. 
This bill contains plenty of loopholes.  
It is a botched job, it will not last long. 
The bill will be enacted, but it will be inoperative and unenforceable. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
I want to congratulate her on that.  
I had another comment. 
5. Every person has the right to respect of his or her privacy.  
Its schedule is written in the conditional. 
We know the great importance of words in legislative texts. 
We find ``should, could, would''.  
I do not know why some on the other side are squawking. 
I am simply trying to explain the difference between ``may'' and ``shall''. 
Clause 4.2.5 of the same schedule reads: 
Bill C-54 is based on the voluntary CSA code. 
Second, ordinary citizens will have to go to the federal court to solve disputes. 
The answer is obvious.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The answer is obvious.  
There are other threats, more insidious but just as real.  
And clause 4.2.5 of the same schedule says: 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues opposite for introducing this amendment. 
It gives me an opportunity to speak again to this legislation.  
I disagree with this for one very simple reason. 
Bill C-54 attempts to address this problem.  
I will tell members what is at stake. 
I will try to be very simple about it. 
People can buy these lists.  
Is that not just a perfect target for criminal activity? 
Yet that can be bought in the United States.  
In the United States organizations rent their lists of names for fundraising. 
I wish it did. 
This is no time to fool around. 
We cannot leave it to the next century. 
We have to do something about it now. 
It has been a dialogue between the Liberals and the Bloc Quebecois. 
I do not know, but that was one of the fears.  
I think the time is now to address this. 
We have to do it urgently. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
I agree with him on that point. 
Section 27(2)(b) reads: 
The Governor in Council may, by order, 
( d ) if satisfied that legislation of a province- 
I want to quote some excerpts because this is a very important document. 
This is an independent, non partisan organization that has a high credibility in Quebec. 
The annual report says: 
This contention is based on a comprehensive review of the CSA code. 
According to the Commission- 
This is in Quebec. 
Therefore I will quote the federal privacy commissioner, Mr. Bruce Phillips. 
I will read the 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
Mr. Speaker, Canadian culture is our inheritance from the past. 
It is our joy in daily lives and it is our gift to the future.  
Generations of Canadians who came before us made possible the birth of Canadian television. 
They did so through exceptional talent and through national will.  
They did so through hard work and again through a collective national decision.  
The results produced by those generations of Canadians are really quite spectacular.  
This reality should give us food for thought and raise the alarm. 
The futures of our respective cultures and cultural diversity are at stake.  
It is our turn to show wise stewardship over our cultural birthright and our future. 
It is our turn to exercise an act of national will.  
Magazines like Canadian Legion Magazine are important to Canada. 
Magazines like Canadian Legion Magazine survive because of the support of the government.  
We live in a time when communication barriers are falling everywhere. 
A member asks why we are putting up barriers. 
We are not putting up barriers. 
It is not promotional protection. 
Nobody is talking about censorship. 
This is not about censorship. 
This is about multiple voices in a global world.  
The first one was printed in 1792 by John Howe. 
Ninety-five per cent of those magazines are American magazines. 
And we have no intention of stopping that. 
We want to see a multiplicity of ideas.  
If that is protectionist, then I should be a member of the Reform Party.  
That is a thought that would even stop me in my tracks.  
They would not be there if Canadians did not want them.  
There is absolutely nothing in this legislation that will stop that.  
That will be the legacy of this legislation. 
If that is protectionist- 
I am sure the hon. member will resume after question period. 
We will now begin Statements by Members.  
GENERATION XX YOUTH CENTRE 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
This was followed by the question ``Where do you want us to go?''  
The rest, as they say, is history.  
Congratulations to the young people, manager Gordie Whitlock and their mentor, Constable Rioux.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
We would not live there, why should we expect them to?  
Cleaning up Sydney must be a priority. 
The time for studies is over. 
NORTH-SOUTH CENTRE OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
NORTH-SOUTH CENTRE OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
We must only mention their title.  
I apologize, Mr. Speaker. 
All Canadians can be proud of his work.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
In 1998 it would take 206 bushels to clothe a farmer for the winter. 
Today on the same section of land it would take 1,443 bushels.  
First, there will be an increase in abandoned farms. 
We must not turn our backs on- 
The hon. member for Windsor-St. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
This is a rather disrespectful, not to say improper way to make such an announcement. 
HEALTH RESEARCH AWARENESS WEEK 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Canadians want our health system to help us be healthy. 
Good health can prevent the need for costly medical treatment. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The hon. member for Scarborough Southwest.  
Hungary is now our partner in NATO. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
By cutting red tape, our government is making seniors' lives easier.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
This is an absolute disgrace.  
The government and the people who run DFO should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.  
GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
This gap did not happen by chance. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Week Without Violence has a superb website. 
It can be reached at www.ywcacanada.ca.  
CHIEF JUSTICE BRIAN DICKSON 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
When he was later named to the Supreme Court of Canada he said: 
He lived up to and surpassed these ideals. 
We are grateful for the life Chief Justice Dickson led- 
The hon. member for London-Fanshawe.  
WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, October is Women's History Month. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
But guess who is screening the tapes? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The solicitor for the Prime Minister is blocking access to the RCMP tapes. 
This is completely unconscionable and goes against anything reasonable.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will have to check the accuracy of the hon. member's assertion. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the counsel for the commission has acknowledged that the tapes exist. 
This is evidence that the Prime Minister's solicitor is burying the tapes. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I mean, come on. 
How can the commission's inquiry be deemed to be fair if the- 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Windsor West, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we know the tapes exist. 
Will the true information go before the independent commission?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member's allegations and innuendoes are unwarranted and unsubstantiated.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, what we just learned is more than troubling. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
He says the government is co-operating completely. 
He is the person who should be speaking to this issue.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general is responsible for the RCMP. 
I asked him a very clear question. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as I said, the government is co-operating completely. 
The counsel for the commission confirms that.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the government is clearly on the defensive. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
This is an important investigation. 
That is exactly what it should be allowed to do.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It has not been approved by Health Canada. 
We have not given approval. 
This has been under review for nine years.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Is he saying it is fine to muzzle scientists? 
Is it fine with the minister to alter documents? 
Is it fine to secretly remove files?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Some of the allegations she mentions go back to 1990. 
They were the subject of television programs in 1994. 
These have been looked at over the years. 
Now they are before the Public Service Staff Relations Board. 
Let us let that board consider the evidence and come to its own conclusions.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Jean Carle is coming to the commission to testify. 
Why don't we let him testify. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Or is the solicitor general again covering for the Prime Minister?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The government has been very forthright. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
I do not care if a television show did expose this. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Now we can see the member has not watched television since 1994. 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this story gets worse. 
Due to the company they were removed from the file.  
Who is looking after us?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member has his facts wrong. 
He should be embarrassed. 
The member should double check his facts.  
In the meantime, Health Canada has not approved rBST. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
One third of the world is currently in a recession. 
We will continue to act in a prudent and responsible way. 
It is our duty and our plan of action.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
That is the reality.  
I am asking whoever speaks on behalf of the government, someone who is responsible- 
There is no one.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
But what the Bloc is suggesting is truly irresponsible.  
Quebec did not suffer much in net terms.  
It is obvious that- 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is very much a question of choice. 
It is incumbent upon all of us to look at the alternatives.  
This is one of the choices we have to make.  
We have cut employment insurance taxes. 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That money does not belong to the government, it belongs to workers and employers.  
It means a lot to them. 
This is a regressive tax that hurts people who are working the most.  
When is it going to do that?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We have some choices to make in terms of a global competitive economy. 
These are some of the choices we have to make.  
We are committed to continuing to cut these payroll taxes. 
That is what we have done in the past- 
The hon. member for Drummond.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We already increased transfers by $1.5 billion last year- 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the priority for us is health. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member asked this question. 
I would like Reform members to stand in their places and answer that question. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Only 43% of unemployed workers received benefits in August. 
Is he perhaps waiting for the green light from the finance minister?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the report is full of statistics on the unemployed. 
There is no point in scaring Canadians.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Trade. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his very important question.  
At its meeting yesterday, the WTO reviewed our request. 
We knew the European Union would not agree. 
As a result, the decision has been postponed by one month.  
The member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Will he lift the gag order? 
Will he let the scientists do their work?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
To this point there has been absolutely no complaint.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
The human version of the disease is identified as CJD. 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I assure the House we take the risk very seriously.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Have we not learned something by Krever? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member has his chronology a bit wrong. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Liberal commercial is over.  
The Sydney tar ponds are saturated with cancer causing toxins. 
How long would it take this Liberal government to clean it up then?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
PROGRAM FOR OLDER WORKERS ADJUSTMENT 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Theirs is a difficult situation.  
We had to end the POWA program, which was unfair. 
However, we are very concerned by their situation.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It is a situation that has resulted from restructuring by the corporation. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
The Employment Insurance Act stipulates that premiums must be reduced. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We must not go into deficit again. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I do not know if I heard the right word, lies. 
Did the hon. member use the word lies? 
I prefer that we not use that word if we possibly can.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, as you know, fishing is very often a family business. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Otherwise, no employment insurance scheme would work.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
In addition, I have made it clear- 
That will bring to a close our question period for today.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is nothing usual about this; it is very unique. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):

FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The tariff code measure will be eliminated. 
The excise tax measure will be eliminated. 
Postal rules will be altered.  
Advertisement revenues represent 60 % of Canadian periodical revenues. 
Parliament is not being asked to support censorship. 
What is at stake is cultural diversity in the world.  
This is not about competing for readers. 
Canadian magazines are happy to compete for readers. 
It is about ensuring the future of Canadian farm magazines. 
The Canadian Corn Producers Association- 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
I hear the member. 
We are more open to American magazines than any other country in the world.  
That is what we would like our American neighbours to think about.  
The United States is our closest ally and friend. 
The simple fact is that unless Canadians stand up for culture, who will? 
Unless Canada stands up for Canadian interests, who will? 
Unless we stand up for our interests who will? 
Forty years ago there were only a handful of Canadian magazines. 
That is what is at stake.  
They talk about our way of life. 
The losers especially would be our children.  
Advertising services are just that, services. 
Services are subject to the general agreement on services. 
This will not affect existing commercial operations.  
The objectives of Canada on this matter are fair. 
The approach taken in this bill is fair. 
There is no restriction on the circulation of foreign goods proposed by this bill.  
Canadian cultural achievements are not a coincidence. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, unfortunately the minister is still living in the seventies. 
What refreshing ideas I heard this morning. 
I asked the chairman in terms of promotion or protection which would she prefer. 
We know what that means. 
She told us about the National Film Board and its super success. 
The National Film Board has promoted Canada around the world. 
It has done a great job, even with reduced funding. 
She has a lot of good advice for all of us in this House.  
There is too much overlap.  
Other advice she gives the committee is that we have to follow the right paradigm. 
We cannot continue to do things we have done in the past. 
That is excellent advice.  
That is a good question.  
That is an interesting question. 
Does it reflect well? 
What does Bill C-55 say about Canada? 
We know where that is.  
The deadline for Canada's response is October 30, 1998. 
What is a split run edition? 
Why does the Minister of Canadian Heritage target split run editions? 
These are magazines they subscribe to or receive by controlled circulation. 
What is controlled circulation? 
These 94% of magazines received by subscription or by controlled circulation are Canadian owned. 
This leaves me to ask the following question of the Minister of Canadian Heritage:
What problem is the minister trying to fix? 
Why is the minister looking for a problem when none exists?  
Bill C-55 is a solution in search of a problem. 
Whose interest is the heritage minister trying to defend? 
Magazines like Maclean's , Saturday Night and Chatelaine are already well read. 
Again, whose interest is the heritage minister trying to defend?  
This bill is really unnecessary. 
That in itself suggests that Bill C-55 is a bad law. 
There are other problems with Bill C-55 that make it a bad law.  
The advertising is a tangible good. 
Magazines sell advertising space, not an advertising service. 
The minister is inventing a definition that is not based on reality.  
This is precisely what Canada's 80 percent tax prevents as well.  
We strongly urge Canada to reconsider the course it has chosen. 
The United States intends to react vigorously if that is not the case.  
The Asian flu on the financial markets is already affecting Canada. 
The prices they are getting for their wheat and barley are trending down. 
It could be the tip of the iceberg. 
I have shown how this bill is unnecessary. 
I want to zero in on the word ``unreasonable''. 
We have rights and freedoms under the charter. 
Those rights and freedoms are guaranteed and are subject only to reasonable limits. 
It limits their freedom of expression. 
It limits their freedom of speech. 
Split run publishers are law-abiding people. 
These people are respectable corporate citizens. 
They are not common criminals.  
The Canadian publishing industry is healthy. 
The market is there.  
I have been in this business nearly 30 years. 
Canada should behave as those other countries do''.  
In fact, I have even heard that Conrad Black opposes this bill.  
Bill C-55 is not reasonable. 
Where is the sense in that?  
The heritage minister does not play well with others. 
And here we go again.  
I refer the House to section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867. 
I refer members to subsection 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. 
It is its summation on this issue of restrictive legislation. 
I quote from the last page: 
All this to deliver a thinly veiled threat.  
Bill C-55 is unnecessary. 
The Canadian magazine industry is healthy and competitive. 
It does not require protection. 
Canadian publishers are well received internationally. 
In the 21st century, let us concentrate on promotion, not protection.  
It is a very bad law.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The amendment is receivable.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois agrees in principle with the bill at second reading. 
Let us take a look at the background of this legislation.  
Consequently, Time-Warner thought it was authorized to move into Canada.  
On April 5, 1993, Sports Illustrated published its first issue out of Richmond Hill. 
On March 24, 1994, the task force published its report. 
In December 1995, Bill C-103 was passed.  
This code prevented the importing into Canada of split run magazines. 
It will be repealed by an order in council.  
Second, Bill C-103 amended the Excise Act. 
The act will be amended by a ways and means motion.  
Third, the postal subsidy. 
Fourth, preferential postal rates. 
The rates for foreign magazines will be reduced to the preferential Canadian rate. 
This measure will cost Canada Post $16 million.  
I will now deal with reaction to the legislation so far.  
Canadian publishers applauded the introduction of this legislation. 
What they wanted was a measure that would protect editorial independence.  
The Bloc Quebecois hopes that the government is right in this case. 
Negotiations are planned for the turn of the century. 
They are supposed to deal with services and maybe investments. 
Neither does the General Agreement on Trade in Services. 
The tools are in place. 
To understand the magazine case, we must know a bit about the magazine industry. 
It was about super profits. 
Canadian publishers will not be able to compete with this type of cut-throat competition. 
An import ban is the ultimate ``quota'' since imports are zero. 
First of all, they made a substantial reduction in the postal subsidy.

The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in such a fashion?  
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I am rising to speak to Bill C-55. 
It has been an interesting debate so far. 
What Bill C-55 will do, if it succeeds, is entrench the status quo. 
There is grandparenting of some existing arrangements which I would like to have seen challenged. 
I do not see anything wrong with protecting Canadian magazines.  
I do not think that is something we should apologize for.  
I am talking particularly about the WTO.  
This is something the minister understood well in a previous incarnation. 
It is fine for the government to come forward and try another way. 
Why have they broken down? 
They did not want the MAI to deal with culture at all.  
This is an opportunity for us to reflect on this larger question. 
Then she said what I think was kind of strange. 
I would say that Canada has obligations when it enters into agreements. 
The WTO is a quite different matter. 
He seemed to indicate that he felt that person was perhaps making a fiscal argument. 
It is not a question of sustainability in any fiscal sense. 
I would say this is something the government ought to be looking at.  
We support the bill with reservations. 
This does not give us any comfort. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
First I want to state my position relative to issues including trade. 
Our party continues to support and believe in the intrinsic strength of trade. 
We can believe in free trade. 
That was the objection France took to the MAI.  
Bill C-55 is a very important piece of legislation. 
The Canadian magazine industry is similar to that. 
We want to protect our cultural integrity in Canada. 
It has been a major priority of any trade discussion. 
It objected to a policy that directly targeted U.S. magazines. 
However, these advertisements must appear throughout their North American publications. 
They cannot be solely targeted toward the Canadian market.  
Magazines are one thing. 
The Internet is another. 
These are questions we have to ask. 
I believe that Bill C-55 is the right legislation now. 
Reform has 60 culture critics in its caucus. 
There are very important reasons for us to protect this particular industry. 
I look at it from a national unity perspective as well. 
Culture defines our beliefs and our values.  
We are not automatically born with a culture. 
It is one of the things I treasure as a Canadian.  
One of the cultural entities I treasure as a Canadian is the CBC. 
One of the ways to facilitate that is to protect our magazine industry.  
Advertising plays a pivotal role in modern day society. 
It has increasingly become a cornerstone of communication. 
It is going to become increasingly difficult. 
We have to become more rigorous. 
We must never forget that.  
We have a great deal of work to do. 
It means things like a vibrant cultural industry. 
This bill is far from perfect. 
We do not do enough for our veterans. 
In short, we support, with some reservations, Bill C-55. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
This would free up advertising dollars for Canadian publications.  
The Minister of Canadian Heritage introduces this bill claiming it will protect Canadian heritage. 
Culture comes as the natural consequence of economic activity. 
The key word in the last statement is natural. 
Sheila's cops, cultural cops, as my colleague said.  
The bill's extraterritorial application is another area I would like to address. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments by my hon. colleague. 
He was pursuing a very interesting train of thought.  
That is what all of us in this House wish to have.  
Madam Speaker, in short, the government should have more faith in Canadian culture. 
I question whether it will.  
Our country's economic and cultural prosperity has been built on foundations of free enterprise. 
Canadians have no reason to fear competition. 
On every occasion that we have faced it we have done well. 
This bill is shortsighted.  
Are some Canadian periodicals facing the threat of extinction? 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
That potentially puts any other Canadian industry at risk.  
Madam Speaker, it is a good question. 
That is something members on the other side should be thinking about. 
That is not the issue.  
My colleague is right. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We want to see Canadian culture thrive in the best way possible.  
Canadian content is far superior.  
Our assertion is that Canadian magazines can compete on their own. 
We take pride in the fact that we have so much trade with the Americans. 
Having said that, there is much that Canadians can do. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the information. 
The bottom line is that the imbalance is huge. 
The number one reason has been repeated time and time again. 
Taxes are far too high. 
They have opportunities to be the best they can become.  
There are some enormous opportunities for Canada to do some very innovative things. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with great attention to my colleague's speech. 
I thought he gave a great overview of the issue.  
Her interventionist approach seems quite inappropriate in this area. 
Could my colleague shed a bit of light on that aspect of the bill?  
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. 
The issue is how can Canadian culture be the best it can become.  
The government believes that protection is the answer. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Canada needs this very badly. 
Our country has large exports. 
Forty per cent of our gross domestic product is derived from our exports. 
That is probably more than any other country in the world. 
Canada clearly needs rules, a rule based regime. 
Canada recognized this a long time ago. 
Canada has held an inordinate amount of sway in these international talks.  
Canada is pushing for more liberalized trade in investment. 
What would happen if that were to happen? 
However we do not have to. 
Those are the rules of the GATT. 
A country has the right to retaliate in kind.  
What form could that retaliation take? 
Let us assume that they took retaliation in the area of culture. 
What does Canada have to lose? 
We have a very big amount to lose. 
They do not want their access denied. 
I think we are cutting off our nose to spite our face.  
What possible good can come out of this? 
We have the matter of Canadian advertisers who want to advertise in split-run magazines. 
It seems to me that they would know what is best for their business. 
It removes a choice from Canadian advertisers. 
Let us look at some of the magazines that claim they need protection. 
Three-quarters of the ads in Maclean's magazine come from outside Canada. 
I do not know that it could.  
We are using foreign money to support our magazines right now. 
Then what will the government do? 
Let us examine the issue of whether the industry needs protection. 
I would agree that it probably does not, but the industry certainly warrants promotion.  
Canadian trade delegations travel all the time. 
Canadian businesses are too.  
Why can they not promote Canadian culture? 
I thought the protectionist walls had been broken down a long time ago. 
We have seen protectionist walls in the past. 
We have an $800 billion industry in Canada. 
That is the GDP of our country. 
Protection does not enter into very many of those industries. 
It basically has to look at the Canadian market all by itself. 
Largely they are industries like the power industry. 
Why should we be afraid of competition? 
We are out in the world every day exporting product. 
They are saying that we cannot compete. 
Many Canadian artists have already discovered that. 
They are looking at that big market. 
We have to get the fundamentals right.  
I think they can make it. 
They can do it. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I apologize to the House for taking up its time. 
If someone else wants to speak, I understand they will refuse that consent. 
I have tried to have some discussions.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
I compliment the hon. member for Mississauga East for bringing this act forward. 
I am not the critic for justice. 
I am not even a lawyer. 
He has outlined the benefits of this bill and endorses it completely. 
I will follow his recommendation from a professional point of view.  
From of a personal point of view I want to add my support. 
Correctional Service Canada is probably one of the biggest employers in my riding. 
It works with many of our other institutions like the community college in Springhill. 
It provides all kinds of information to us and the communities provide information back. 
It is very much a community effort. 
Also it would tie in nicely with the expertise of the people. 
It would tie in nicely with the facilities. 
When a prisoner comes into the system the first place they go is Springhill. 
I certainly endorse the solicitor general's proposal for a new training centre. 
I strongly recommend that it go to the Springhill community.  
It is just as a member of parliament. 
This murder took place on July 24, 1991.  
I was involved with it as a member of parliament at that time. 
There has never been anyone held accountable for it. 
He was in the care, custody and control of Correctional Service Canada. 
He was murdered and there has never been any penalty. 
James Mills was murdered in custody on July 24, 1991. 
It has been closed several times and swept under the carpet. 
We have been able to drag it out several times. 
Time after time we have met with Correctional Service Canada people. 
We have met with the commissioner of Correctional Service Canada. 
The Mills family has never had closure. 
I think it makes imminent sense and I certainly support that.  
The second part of the bill says the same thing for murderers. 
A prisoner in Renous murdered another prisoner. 
There is no deterrent. 
There is no reason for him not to do it. 
I endorse this bill 100%.  
We want to focus on that part of justice. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
My riding of Oak Ridges is evolving. 
I will give some examples.  
On September 9, 1995 there was a domestic homicide. 
A husband strangled his wife. 
He pleaded not guilty. 
Upon conviction of manslaughter he served five years in jail.  
On January 23, 1997 there was a domestic homicide. 
A young offender stabbed his mother to death. 
That occurred on February 18, 1997. 
I cannot even imagine what those families have gone through. 
There should be no discounts in sentencing.  
We should be clear and concise. 
Canadians want criminals treated in a clear way.  
We should provide the justice system with clear and unequivocal direction.  
A sentence should apply for each specific crime and for each victim. 
Full time should be served for each sentence.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
My motion was even broader than the scope of Bill C-251.  
Without truth in sentencing we lose confidence in our criminal justice system.  
That is what she said. 
Clifford Olson committed multiple murders. 
We feel that he should serve multiple consecutive sentences. 
Justice must be done and seen to be done. 
Where are the Young Offenders Act changes? 
It has been months since the minister last spoke about that.  
That is what the bill proposes.  
The Liberals are allowing their funding to dry up. 
In my riding the RCMP is rationing the gasoline used in the police cruisers. 
It is like living under the War Measures Act. 
During times of war we ration gasoline.  
That is what he said in question period this week. 
The RCMP has not been rationing gas for 125 years. 
We do not need five star Liberal jails.  
The Liberals should be concerned about the criminal committing further crimes. 
This government should be ashamed.  
The hon. member for Mississauga East is concerned about the victims of crime. 
The bill she has introduced provides for consecutive sentencing. 
We should all support this bill. 
This bill will contribute to bringing safety back to our streets. 
It will restore a measure of public safety. 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
They talked about the moral anguish suffered by family members and friends alike. 
This shows the law is flawed. 
Of course, the victims are dead now, but their families are still suffering.  
When a sentence is handed down, it is a concurrent sentence. 
After 15 years, they have the opportunity to recover their freedom.  
Of course, this is horrible for the victims' families.  
Very often the victims were children or women.  
These crimes are often beyond our imagination.  
There is not much more to be said on this issue. 
Our colleague did her homework. 
Many people have voiced their opinion on this matter. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Life imprisonment in Canada does not mean life. 
That is not always the case and it never was.  
There is no consistency from one end of the country to the other. 
Change begins with this bill.  
There is no volume discount. 
If someone gets three speeding tickets they are going to pay three fines.  
This bill seeks the same principle for serious and vicious crimes. 
Here is a compelling point. 
How can members of this House live with that statistic? 
I find this unacceptable. 
Constituents in my riding find this unacceptable. 
Members on both sides of this House find it unacceptable as well.  
Bill C-251 will do just that. 
We can all relate to the public's need to feel safe. 
However, it is time to do more than just relate. 
Our justice system demands urgent changes. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
This issue also illustrates a larger problem with respect to Private Members' Business. 
It would violate the ability of MPs to represent their constituents. 
It would violate the ability of the Canadian public to be represented in the House.  
I know the government House Leader is listening intently to me. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.
