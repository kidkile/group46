Tenth Anniversary of Tiananmen Square Massacre 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
We in Canada live in a free and democratic society. 
We enjoy freedom of conscience, of religion, of expression, and of association. 
We have the right to due process and fair trial. 
I am not trying to be sanctimonious. 
I know that we are not perfect. 
However, at least in Canada, these citizens have the right to due process.  
Referring to the massacres of 1989, Mr. Chan told an audience in Vancouver: 
Human dignity and human lives are the most valuable things a nation has. 
No government can justify killing its own people.  
I could not agree with him more.  
I hope we will be hearing more from him and his colleagues. 
Some of us will continue the struggle in their names.  
University of Prince Edward Island 
Congratulations to Centre for International Education on Winning National Award 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
The Winds of Change 
Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck :
It has definitely made a change in my life. 
There were places I once could not go in Canada. 
I recall my first visit to the Queen's City, Toronto. 
Not too many years ago, this right was not available to all of us. 
We have no problems with our neighbours. 
There has been change, and change is continuing. 
My presence as a member of the Senate is an indication of that change. 
The winds of changes are still blowing. 
We have black young people working in banks as clerks and managers. 
Twenty years ago, such a thing was unheard of. 
There are still some areas for improvement - but what else is new?  
The winds of change have brought us all a long way since World War II. 
Thank God almighty, we are free at last."  
Why has so little been done? 
What can our country do? 
Second, it can show leadership. 
Canadians have a history of success as human rights advocates. 
Honourable senators, we have a strong reputation as a negotiator in the international arena. 
New arms races are underway.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Conflict in Yugoslavia-Deployment of Ground Troops-Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, to my knowledge, all options are being examined. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
They have no contribution to make." 
It is somewhat disarming to hear statements such as these.  
Canada was not invited to attend. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Did we make any inquiries or are we just letting the situation ride?  
Honourable senators, may I commend the honourable senator for that response. 
I assure him that we stand by him wholeheartedly if that is the case.  
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I have enormous respect for the opinions of former president Carter. 
We were even co-leaders of the 1993 mission observing the presidential election in Paraguay.  
We have had few cases of unintended strikes against civilians.  
The indictment of President Milosevic makes our direction clearer than ever.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a number of delayed answers. 
All avenues and information that can be relevant to this investigation are being considered.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on May 6, 1999) 
Miscellaneous Statute Law Amendment Proposals 
Since then, eight sets of proposals have been introduced and eight acts have been passed. 
I urge all honourable senators to adopt this report.  
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Canadian District of Moravian Church of America-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
The church was started about the time of the Protestant Reformation by John Hus. 
They have four congregations there and two fellowships. 
Earlier this year, two of the oldest congregations marked their 100th anniversary.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Atkins, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Consideration of Report of Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
I guess he changed his mind, because the GST is still with us.  
Moreover, some of the Atlantic provinces now have an HST. 
A bit of background is useful at this point. 
This can become an intergenerational problem as well. 
She also told this chamber that the matter was "under active discussion." 
Senator Fairbairn has done some fine work in the area of literacy. 
She has served as a voice for our many fellow citizens. 
However, honourable senators, it is now almost two years later. 
The bill before us gives us an opportunity to take real action on literacy. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a question of the honourable senator.  
You cannot even do math.  
I am not very good at math." 
This was a high school student.  
You must be able to read a computer instruction book. 
We must get back to the basics of reading and writing in this country. 
We must absolutely learn to read and write.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Consideration of Report of Special Committee-Motion in Amendment-Debate Continued 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
It is in this spirit that the committee has proposed a number of recommendations.  
Recommendation 16, for example, states: 
Recommendation number 18 states: 
In terms of electronic encryption, a similar problem must be confronted. 
We must put a stop to the brain drain toward our neighbour to the south.  
In a parliamentary democracy, however, the role of Parliament should ultimately take precedence. 
It could even be styled "The Special Ad Hoc Committee."  
He has my respect. 
On motion of Senator Pepin, debate adjourned.  
Security Incident at Vancouver APEC Conference 
Motion to Establish Special Committee-Debate Continued 
That the committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
It is a story of money and power, and of the global economy. 
Indeed, accountability is the cornerstone of Canada's parliamentary democratic system.  
Perhaps there is something good about our system. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable Senator Kinsella, I must advise you that the time allocated has now elapsed. 
If the Senate gives its consent, you can certainly continue.  
Honourable senators, is there consent?  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Would the honourable senator permit a question?  
His answer, I thought, was quite unsatisfactory. 
Nevertheless, the committee was established.  
That material is available to us.  
That is how it works. 
The appropriation of money is the key to responsible government. 
My question to Senator Kinsella is:
I do not know the answer to the question. 
There must be precedent that could be examined in court situations. 
I do not know how that is resolved in our court system. 
I am sure it has happened before. 
We are familiar with the the inquiry into the Pearson airport agreements in the Senate. 
I thank the honourable senator for that question. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
If so, did he find within that book any help with this dilemma?  
Mr. Lee was kind enough to send a copy of his book to me. 
The last pages of it deal with this very issue. 
I commend the book to all honourable senators.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
He is Senator James Balfour. 
I commend the motion to your support, honourable senators.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
