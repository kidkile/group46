The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
In 1932, under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union dramatically increased its grain procurement. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The minister's response? 
Go to the RCMP. 
The RCMP, however, cannot investigate. 
The result is an abuse of the grassroots people.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Until 1867, the Abitibi region was part of the Northwest Territories. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
In other words, the foundations of the provincial government have been shaken. 
What is the federal government doing?  
I urge the government to address this problem as soon as possible. 
Get on with the job.  
TRICENTENNIAL OF MAISON SAINT-GABRIEL 
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
Maison Saint-Gabriel is 300 years old this year. 
CITY OF L'ANCIENNE-LORETTE 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
THE LATE PETER WONG 
Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):
Mr. Wong held the distinction of being the first elected chairman of my region.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):
I thank them on behalf of my mother, a survivor of leukemia.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The food left the Ukraine, but the people were barricaded in. 
The results devastated and nearly destroyed an entire generation of Ukrainians. 
Moreover, it was a crime in the Ukraine to discuss the famine. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
This visit will allow us to forge new ties and to strengthen existing ones.  
The fight for democracy in Algeria deserves our support.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
What can they do to reverse their situation? 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Ann-Margaret Dickey was a soldier in the Canadian Armed Forces.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am informed that it is doing the investigation.  
She decided to go public today.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
In 1997 we put in the national investigation service which did not exist before. 
That is its task. 
On top of that, we have named the ombudsman.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
They want to believe that there is zero tolerance. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
None of them gave her a satisfactory response. 
The ministers would not even let her know if an investigation was under way.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the national investigative process is still ongoing. 
The Reform Party trolls around trying to find something and bring it back here. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
My question for the minister is, what about the other 39?  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
How can we expect to respond to something 39?  
When the time comes, charges will be laid.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Does he not get it? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Moreover, hundreds of thousands of Canadians are very happy with them.  
We can apply economic development measures. 
We can apply adjustment measures. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Prime Minister.  
It begins by cleaning up our own act. 
What happened to Canada's Kyoto commitment? 
Was it a sham?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Kyoto is taken very seriously by this government. 
It was not a sham. 
That is why we are pursuing this avenue.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
That is what the environment commissioner is looking for as well.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these allegations are absolutely ridiculous. 
We are showing leadership on this file.  
We are concerned about the environment. 
We are concerned about human health and we will achieve our objectives.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The report this morning on the radio was factually wrong in important respects. 
I encourage the member to look at the facts.  
It said this morning that Health Canada awaited a U.S. study. 
The hon. member for Charlotte.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is confusing the issue. 
What we are talking about is the responsibility of Health Canada. 
Is the minister considering compensating those victims? 
His facts, unfortunately, disagree with what the record actually states. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We did not wait for the Americans. 
We were ahead of the FDA.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Why did we continue to use dirty blood for that period of time?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have established the Blood Safety Council. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
His cuts are hurting everyone, whatever he says.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, health is one of this government's top priorities. 
That is a priority for this government. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we know what the situation is in Quebec. 
But hospitals have also been closed in Ontario. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have given a clear answer. 
We have said that health is our top priority.  
We have already taken action in this regard with the budget brought down in February. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
He promised that he would get back to her.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, clearly I would be been in violation. 
This investigation is ongoing. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Ann Margaret Dickey was seeking an investigation into her complaint. 
The parliamentary secretary's excuse is not acceptable.  
What guarantee is he going to give?  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The ombudsman has no position in criminal cases. 
It is an ongoing situation and it is before the investigators.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have looked at each of these routes. 
We have analysed it meticulously.  
Air Canada got a lot out of these deals. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Can the Prime Minister tell us what the government's position is? 
Does he believe these claims are legitimate? 
Who owns British Columbia?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, British Columbia belongs to all of its citizens.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, clearly we understand the repercussions.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
It is a fiscally responsible approach. 
It is a Liberal approach. 
It is a Canadian approach. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister and the minister of Indian affairs. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Together we will reconcile aboriginal rights in British Columbia.  
Is the hon. member suggesting we should legislate compensation? 
How much is she prepared to pay for that? 
They are saying we should legislate without true certainty. 
How much are they prepared for the lack of certainty in their approach? 
They say we should talk about cash, not land. 
How much is she prepared to put on the table?  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
A decision was made anyway to use this stock for the sake of money.  
Will he adopt a position on hepatitis C compensation- 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Seventeen of his 50 were in relation to regulation and safety. 
We have adopted them. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
If the member wants to be taken seriously she should- 
The hon. member for Madawaska-Restigouche.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, unemployed Canadians across the country are continuing to suffer.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Second, the member can look at his own province of New Brunswick. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been very clear on this issue.  
We will have to monitor it very closely. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
This would be a wonderful step for Nigeria and for the entire world.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to review the circumstances surrounding this case.  
CASINOS ON CRUISE SHIPS 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
We are asking her to do something, for once and for all. 
When will she be taking action?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Will the minister accept this courageous decision and agree not to appeal it? 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my department is reviewing the Rosenberg decision. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
This summer the province will receive some $300,000 less. 
Students across Canada are being affected by these cuts. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is why the project is being reallocated.  
Our government has doubled the jobs program. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us talk about Banff. 
Last fall the minister shut down a democratic process top down. 
She then established a new process. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on the contrary. 
He and I have had a personal opportunity to review all of the aerial photographs.  
It is unfortunate what the Banff council did. 
The secretary of state, the cabinet and I have rejected that position.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Consequently, these residents have been asking to be expropriated since 1986.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
The Reform member directed an accusation at the member for Ottawa Centre. 
He very clearly stated that the hon. member had lied. 
But I decided at the time that it was not a direct accusation.  
I reviewed Hansard and I reviewed the tapes. 
I thank the hon. member for his intervention.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to put a motion?  
The hon. member needs unanimous consent to table a document in the House.  
We have a no and we have a maybe. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
A number of people have been asking for legislation of this sort. 
It is important to the consumers of the country.  
That, of course, would be subject to the payment of a prescribed interest charge.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I am happy to present this petition.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
These petitions come from people from all over southern Alberta. 
Of course, that is a big issue in Alberta right now. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The petitioners call for tougher sentencing. 
I am happy to present this petition on behalf of my constituents.  
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Therefore the petitioners call upon the House not to go through with this sale.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
They call for the repeal of Bill C-68. 
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today. 
The first involves the firearms act.  
They feel the money should be better directed toward that.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
It is critical to ensuring the economic well-being of our province.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a number of petitions to present. 
One petition is from constituents in my riding of Serbian descent.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the final petition is signed by 200 people from my riding. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
He should know better.  
Oh, he does know. 
He has been cautioned on this before.  
They also believe that an inadequate dialysis service exists across the country. 
I will not mention where those signatures were collected.  
The second petition is from the same series. 
They call upon parliament to work and support the bioartificial kidney project.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
I would like to know when I could expect that question to be answered.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
I want these questions answered. 
Mr. Speaker, I have made a note of Questions Nos. 78 and 79. 
I will not repeat my explanation. 
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
However, it is primarily about military justice.  
Discipline is at the heart of any efficient and effective armed force. 
The amendments contained in Bill C-25- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
I take it, then, there is not consent.  
Mr. Speaker, the government took action after a number of unfortunate incidents.  
The government has also responded to the recommendations of the Somalia commission of inquiry.  
They fully endorsed the amendments contained in the bill. 
Each of these components is a significant building block in the revitalization of military justice. 
The JAG is appointed by cabinet on the recommendation of the minister. 
Bill C-25 has set out the duties the JAG must perform. 
We believe we have done what is necessary to ensure the independence of the JAG.  
Bill C-25 will remove the minister from such day to day administration. 
The automatic permanent reduction in rank to private has been eliminated. 
The members will be paid as privates while serving detention.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
In short, there would be nothing left for an inspector general. 
As I said in committee all bases are covered.  
The removal of the death penalty from the military is long overdue. 
Accordingly I urge all hon. members to support the bill.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for its generosity. 
It is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-25. 
Yet their morale is the lowest it has been in years.  
There are many reasons for it. 
A situation is taking place in our military that is tearing out its guts. 
Criminal activity including rape is somehow being allowed in the military. 
It is turning a blind eye. 
Those things are hardly being touched upon. 
The traditions of our military have been torn away. 
The ability to wear badges of merit are forbidden within our military.  
Salaries have been stalled and flattened out for a long time, and we understand that.  
The government could have put forth constructive solutions that would not have cost any money. 
It is important also to look at our equipment. 
Military personnel move around the country. 
That sends a very bad message to our military personnel. 
They are not looking to get rich. 
They know the situation they are in. 
They understand the situation of the government and the restrictions it is under. 
However they expect to be treated fairly.  
Those individuals have no assurance of what will happen in the future. 
They are not being communicated with at all on their future. 
They know the tender process that is taking place is occurring for efficiency reasons. 
That is no way to treat the people in our military. 
The hon. government House leader on a point of order.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
To revamp their morale, make the accommodation assistance allowance non-taxable. 
Make it applicable to every person serving in our military. 
Bring back the traditions within the military. 
Bring back the honourable traditions that have given them pride.  
Give our soldiers a clear direction as to what their activities are to be. 
Many have worked for many years. 
They have undergone great cuts. 
Let us remember that our tradition in our military is longstanding. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this legislation. 
There is not enough independence.  
The military police is another area where there was reform in this legislation. 
That is what is in this legislation. 
What is not in the legislation? 
The position of ombudsman is not mentioned in the legislation. 
The position of independent inspector general has been completely left out. 
The ombudsman was announced yesterday. 
Let us look at the position of ombudsman. 
There is no mention of it in this legislation. 
To me that means absolutely no power. 
That was something made very clear in the press conference yesterday. 
The ombudsman who was appointed has no power.  
The ombudsman rather presents the information to the minister. 
What really has been accomplished with that? 
I would like the parliamentary secretary to explain how all the bases have been covered.  
That was reinforced yesterday with the minister's announcement.  
The minister in yesterday's press conference really reinforced that.  
It is clear that very little progress has been made.  
That is what people have called for. 
It is a glaring hole.  
He has been successful at what he has done. 
However, I think Mr. Marin is headed for frustration. 
They are certainly not there for the money. 
They are there because they want to serve this country. 
It is sad that has happened. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
The debate on this bill demonstrates how commentators can easily be off the mark. 
Bill C-25 is a most important piece of legislation. 
My opinion is that a separate military justice system is important and should be preserved. 
At the same time we will be opposing this bill. 
I am not in any way impugning the competency of Mr. Marin. 
This is called an interference complaint.  
This puts military police on a different footing from civilian police. 
There is a charge in criminal law called obstruction of justice. 
The charge may simply be laid based on the facts.  
I do not believe this legislation accomplishes this.  
I urge my colleagues to vote against Bill C-25.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleagues from the Reform Party for sharing their time.  
Those motives generally are to look good rather than to do good. 
Today is one of those days.  
Addressing the issue of justice in the military is both important and urgent. 
There are several questions we have to ask ourselves today. 
The first question is perhaps the most important and the key to this. 
What events brought us to this point? 
However they are worth repeating and repeating. 
That brings us here today.  
Inquiry commissions are created because there is a public concern that needs to be addressed. 
Women do not feel comfortable doing their job. 
Saying it is unacceptable and doing something about it are two different things.  
The Minister of National Defence introduced a new ombudsman yesterday. 
That is certainly not acceptable.  
Did this government act in the appropriate way? 
But the government did not listen. 
Instead it shut down an inquiry and stifled debate. 
Now the Canadian public will feel cheated, and justly so. 
There are ongoing investigations into sexual abuse. 
I do not think so. 
The government ignored that recommendation. 
The government ignored that recommendation.  
They can make recommendations and the CDS can ignore them. 
The Canadian public has little reason to believe that the recommendations will not be ignored.  
I am sad to say the motion was turned down.  
This government's members do not listen. 
We know that the government would not even listen. 
The Minister of National Defence is not listening now. 
But this government does not listen. 
It does not hear. 
It does not want an office with teeth and with real authority.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
It is true that the bill includes some accountability mechanisms. 
Generally, it is preferable to have an impartial outside observer.  
In the end, what will there be for it to do? 
Its judicial independence and impartiality is therefore of paramount importance to the accused.  
Despite the changes to the regulations, the risk is still there. 
What effect does this have? 
Imagine the consequences on military careers of stepping out of line.  
We must simply be aware of the risk of hierarchical influence.  
At first glance, there is merit in creating a new commission. 
According to the type of complaint and respondent, the reviewing authority will vary. 
It is a matter of respect for all military personnel. 
They, like any other Canadian citizen, have a right to be treated fairly. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The bill was introduced last December. 
Another factor has been the adoption of the charter of rights and freedoms. 
It did not happen. 
Whistleblower protection was another item that came out of the Dickson Report. 
Again, this was not acted on.  
This was not acted on at all.  
I want to put her case on the record.  
Here are the key points as they were related to me. 
This individual, who was then 18 years of age, signed on as a female bosun. 
She was dispatched to the west coast and assigned to a ship there.  
The seaman was partially naked. 
She eventually requested a leave. 
She could not go back on the ship. 
She never had a chance to testify at the trial. 
This is symptomatic of the problem we have in the military. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The House has heard the terms of the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the motion?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
He did excellent work in support of that cause. 
Now I am seeking the consent of the House to have this nomination ratified.  
The honourable Mr. Reid is an historian by training. 
Probably the opposition House leader would understand just how I feel in that regard.  
I pay homage to him as well as a pioneer of this legislation.  
I highly recommend this person. 
As we say ``Them's the breaks''.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see so many of my colleagues here today. 
I will talk about the process of appointing an information commissioner.  
We are going to support this appointment. 
I will go through a bit of the process. 
During my lifetime I have probably interviewed 300 to 600 people. 
I lost count years ago. 
The selection process of any individual is common.  
I did not know that individual. 
Once the name was proposed there was quite a backlash. 
A lot of people said that the person was inappropriate for the job.  
There are two problems with that. 
Second, we managed to embarrass the individual. 
That process clearly does not work. 
It is very much like patronage.  
Let us look at the process we went through further to that. 
We took a chance. 
It turned out the individual was in my opinion quite competent. 
John Reid had excellent answers to those questions.  
What is the impact? 
Here is the impact I think we have just gone through. 
John Reid in my opinion was a very good candidate. 
That is how much I thought of this individual and his character.  
We have left an open door on the whole process. 
There is another impact of this process. 
These are well qualified people who would like access to these types of jobs. 
They would at least like to have the opportunity to compete. 
They do not insist they get the job; they just want the opportunity to compete. 
I think that is wrong.  
I applaud the whole House for that. 
I think he is a very good candidate. 
We have to go the next step. 
It only gave credibility to the process. 
The next time it should try it all the way. 
My congratulations to Mr. John Reid. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I know the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough has a few comments to make.  
I do not know if the member from Red Deer would be amenable to that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
MILITARY MISSIONS BEYOND CANADIAN BOUNDARIES 
Mr. Speaker, I will explain the motion further before I really get started.  
We are not talking about three people going off for telecommunications duty. 
We are not talking about some of the smaller missions. 
I want to relay some of the motivation for this. 
I had the privilege of meeting with these troops in both these locations. 
In Bosnia I was there observing elections. 
I was proud of what I saw. 
There is a Canadian flag. 
There is a Bosnian flag. 
I love taking pictures. 
I have seen their faces light up with pride. 
They said they did not know we were doing that sort of thing. 
Nothing comes up overnight. 
We knew about Bosnia. 
In the 1980s we talked about Bosnia and its potential. 
Many people thought Kosovo would be the place that would ignite first. 
It turns out that it might be the place that ignites last. 
We knew that something was going to happen there. 
He told us that there was a problem between the Tutsis and the Hutus. 
People were not made aware of it. 
These things do not just happen.  
The Americans were in Haiti in 1925 trying to solve the problems of Haiti. 
We know the potential places. 
We know the problems in Sudan. 
We know the problems in Nigeria.  
To say it cannot happen is just not acceptable. 
To say it would handcuff the government is just not possible. 
That is not an excuse.  
How should we handle this sort of thing? 
How should we get accountability and transparency? 
How would it work in this House?  
What I would like to put forward is a process something like this. 
Members are aware of the special debates that we have in this House. 
That is not what I am talking about. 
That is not an excuse for democracy.  
This is non-partisan politics.  
We heard yesterday from parliamentarians from Pakistan. 
The question was asked of how to solve the problem in Kashmir.  
That is a role he suggested he would like to see Canada play. 
There would be all party input. 
There has been an information session of two hours. 
There has been debate for two hours. 
Now comes the most important part of all. 
We have a responsibility. 
Then in a free vote we stand up and are counted.  
I cannot believe that it would be very controversial. 
All of us would feel better. 
Canadians would be informed. 
The committee can adjust and fix it however it wants.  
That is the framework we are talking about. 
We are all responsible. 
I find it very troubling that we do not know what they are doing. 
The minister's poll said that 61% of Canadians want to be informed.  
Canadians are saying that is what they want. 
The minister's polls have shown that.  
This would lend legitimacy to budget figures that many people do not understand. 
There are budget figures of millions of dollars for missions. 
This would lend some legitimacy to the spending of that kind of money.  
We have studied the issue. 
You have watched us on national television studying this issue. 
We have spoken to the issue and we have voted on the issue. 
We do not care what that media might do to you. 
We believe in you. 
We trust you and we are giving you our confidence''.  
That is what it is all about. 
That is why I hope all members will see fit to support this motion. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We sometimes disagree but not in terms of the general thrust of his positions. 
Let me say that there is a fundamental issue of constitutional law. 
We have some problems with constitutionalizing in an American sense. 
I will cite a perfect example.  
Parliament was out of session. 
Could we convoke it?  
They all replied they would and I thanked them for it. 
I told them I thought we were making a precedent.  
In a very real sense the Prime Minister and the foreign minister are constitutional activists.  
It is an excellent report and synthesis and breaks new ground. 
We have instituted travelling committees. 
One went to Bosnia. 
The hon. member for Red Deer had been to Bosnia on a previous mission. 
A third one has just been to Chiapas, Mexico. 
That was an all-party group. 
It has reported back. 
That is what I call law in the making in a very dynamic sense. 
The committee is in evolution. 
The foreign intelligence services do not give enough information. 
There is the change, evolution of parliamentary committees. 
It is not the American way, but we think it is more effective. 
It has that built-in element of flexibility. 
I think we have picked up the substance of the hon. member's idea. 
This is law in the making in the Canadian way. 
I think the substance of the hon. member's suggestion is incorporated. 
It has already been suggested we examine the issue of treaty-making power. 
I wonder whose fault that is.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Those debates have had little impact on public opinion. 
It is time to complete this reform. 
It could even abrogate it, if it wanted to.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
They take the form of ``take note'' debates. 
I would certainly want to speak in favour of the motion. 
This is not just out of respect for parliament. 
In Canada a decision of this magnitude can be made by executive order. 
Did we have such a debate here? 
Did we have a ministerial statement that members of the opposition could have responded to? 
This was done without benefit of parliamentary debate whatsoever.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
The first instance was in February of this year. 
I remember it well. 
Let me share with the House the reasons why I remember it so clearly.  
The situation looked very serious. 
It looked like there might be another war.  
That was not accurate.  
This government has no courage.  
I am in favour of the sentiment behind this motion. 
Unfortunately the Reform Party as usual did not get it right. 
The phrase ``significant contingent of Canadian military personnel'' is not clear. 
I suppose I should give the member for Red Deer credit. 
Would the party of referendum not support that idea?  
To be fair, this Liberal government does not provide much reason to have faith. 
That means sending troops at short notice when they are needed. 
In my opinion that is the root of the problem.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
This remains the view of the government.  
This must be avoided.  
The government remains committed to this principle. 
Canadians also understand these missions can be very dangerous. 
It is true that this new security environment has much to commend it. 
Conflicts fueled by ethnic nationalism have become a depressingly constant story in the daily news. 
These problems are demanding the attention of the international community. 
They are too horrifying simply to ignore.  
The government will continue to take advantage of the views of the House. 
I ask all members to take note of that accordingly.  
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Her name was never put forward.  
This is simply not the case. 
I regret that even Mr. Reid has this perception. 
I saw a quote from him to that effect. 
There was no opportunity for what I would think was due process.  
This did not happen. 
That is not the point. 
We have made some progress. 
I commend the government for that tiny, baby step forward. 
It needs to go a lot further than that. 
``Isn't that a wonderful idea? 
It never occurred to us before''. 
I wanted to clear that up. 
It is one of the most secretive cultures in the world. 
It will bury you in inconsequential information. 
Mr. Reid has an obstacle to overcome. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Then a few minutes later he said it was true that they did.  
If the member does not mind, I would like him to explain the mechanism. 
I said that we did not.  
That is the context in which I raised his name.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate. 
The information commissioner would be an officer of parliament and not of the government. 
That is a key point. 
The hon. member used the expression of baby steps. 
It is perhaps a little more than that. 
It is a proud history with respect to the involvement of the Progressive Conservative Party.  
Mr. Speaker, you may remember the late Ged Baldwin. 
Mr. Baldwin began his campaign for the freedom of information legislation in 1969.  
Mr. Baldwin saw the existing statute as a beginning. 
He placed great faith in the commissioner of parliament to improve the existing law.  
These are important issues for us in parliament to address today. 
I think this will serve parliament well.  
We hope that he will bring great honour and integrity to his new post.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a few comments.  
In Mr. Reid we have just such a person.  
I would also like to comment on Mr. Grace. 
Mr. Grace has been a superb access commissioner. 
I hope my colleague will support that legislation. 
I think they reflect the non-partisan nature which this process has unfolded.  
I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
I thank the Chair for its indulgence.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The information commissioner must not only be impartial, but must be seen as being impartial. 
That is very important. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I was what was called for a while the ethics critic for our party. 
I feel the same way about the appointment of the access to information commissioner. 
This was the process that was followed. 
I think that principle applies here as well. 
I think that is all I will say about the process. 
I want to challenge him personally in this way. 
It will impinge directly on his function and his work. 
Perhaps we will make sure that he gets a copy of Hansard .  
First, the big challenge is to be fair. 
I understand that he is going to try to do that. 
That is when that commissioner becomes involved. 
He now needs to arbitrate. 
That is what Canadians have a right to know. 
They are about dealing in the truth.  
Is the person entitled to this information? 
If so, he will clearly and quickly order that it be granted. 
He was a Liberal cabinet minister. 
He has the Liberal label. 
I have a tendency to think that this is a man who will be fair. 
He told us that in the interview. 
I attended the interview that was held by the committee. 
The information was withheld because it was personal. 
There was a conflict. 
Our argument was that it should not have been there.  
How will we get answers to that type of thing? 
I remember being interviewed by the media on this subject. 
What else do you want to know?'' 
That is how we should deal with our government and departmental offices.  
I have done two things in my little talk. 
First you say what you are going to say and then you review it. 
I have done two things. 
I have talked about the process. 
It should be one where anybody can apply. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
We cannot have accountability without transparency. 
It has become obsolete. 
There are too many ways to get around it.  
They had to do with inadequacies in the act. 
The bureaucracy in interpreting the act interpreted the act honestly and correctly, we presume. 
The answer is yes, I agree.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
MI'KMAQ EDUCATION ACT 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
This is truly a historic piece of legislation. 
What struck me most about Chief Marshall's presentation was this simple statement: 
The government has received numerous letters of support for Bill C-30. 
Marg Forbes told the committee: 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I will report on this later. 
This is how we will enrich education with the Mi'kmaq language''.  
For those who do not know, the word ``Mi'kmaq'' has a particular meaning. 
What does it mean? 
So the notion of the sun is very important.  
For them, the sun links the creator, man and the environment. 
The sparks give form to life.  
The legislation is perfectly consistent with the philosophy I have tried to explain.  
What I said before still stands. 
This involves transfers at the legislative, administrative and financial levels.  
The financial aspect lends a degree of originality to the bill we have before us. 
I shall get back to that later.  
I described this before as one step toward native self-determination. 
Generations of native people necessarily grow up with a system of education. 
All that had been denied. 
In the end, it succeeded in crushing an entire generation of natives. 
An entire generation of natives was wiped out. 
I would now like to turn to another concept. 
The Mi'kmaq now listening know their history well. 
The one that was used in Nova Scotia was administrative in nature. 
It costs too much to deliver services all over the place''. 
This forced the people to move elsewhere to survive. 
I think it is important to address these issues at third reading.  
The government is discriminating against these people to a certain extent.  
Why are these people not living on reserve? 
Often for reasons beyond their control. 
Clause 6.(1) of the bill states, and I quote: 
The government's decision is therefore deplorable.  
So the issue is one of equity and non-discrimination in our opinion. 
There are also huge problems with respect to native housing.  
Right now, overcrowding on reserves is forcing people to leave. 
The lack of jobs on reserves is also forcing people to look for work elsewhere. 
This shows the importance of band membership. 
We therefore have two classes of citizen.  
It also has a negative effect on their culture. 
That was the reason for my amendment, to correct this situation. 
What I said before is true. 
Another amendment I felt was important was the matter of the treaty. 
The government has a number of possibilities once an agreement has been signed. 
The government opted for the bill.  
The issue of a treaty is important. 
What does a treaty mean? 
Treaties are not just international. 
The first Europeans to arrive here signed treaties with the native peoples. 
The government preferred the bill approach. 
A treaty and a bill are two very different things. 
So they said to themselves: ``Let us move ahead one step at least. 
The Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-30. 
I also want to wish the Mi'kmaq good luck. 
They are entirely able to do so. 
These people must be given hope.  
I think that the Mi'kmaq are one of Canada's greatest First Nations. 
I wish them all the best with their education program in Nova Scotia. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is good news and bad news. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
Chief Marshall in his remarks went on to say: 
This decision making process has had devastating effects in our communities. 
As vice-chief Rick Simon of the Assembly of First nations stated: 
Instead, it should be the reverse. 
It had been going on for centuries. 
Mr. Don Julien, director of the Confederacy of Mainland Micmacs, raised several important concerns. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
It was immoral and it failed.  
Even when we tried to do good it turned bad.  
The choices that our governments have made bring shame on them and on the House. 
But worse than that, the impression it creates is wrong.  
This is the truth of the origin and intention of Bill C-30. 
It is often said that we have much to learn from our aboriginal people. 
I hope some of the points I have raised will illustrate that truth.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I agree with the bill. 
I think most of them had valid points. 
I have spoken several times on this issue. 
He used the analogy of education being the key to success. 
I think that is true.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to raise an issue which is very important.  
I do not like that.  
I wonder whether he would want to comment on that.  
We look after each other. 
I am not aware of what is on the Progressive Conservative website.  
I would assume that he is.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
It is in effect more or less a school board.  
We wanted to open it up to other people as well.  
We have no problem with the view that chiefs are politicians. 
In this case control of education for their communities was their vision. 
It just does not work that way in other areas. 
Why in this one?  
This would be one way of doing it.  
We want to see economic activity spread around. 
They will be involved in the delivery of educational products and services.  
They were all chiefs or people who worked with chiefs.  
The chief's have a broader outlook. 
Our support on this bill was contingent on having this basic and fundamental amendment passed. 
We know what happened in committee. 
The Liberals voted it down. 
We asked why would they vote against such a common sense amendment. 
They would like things to continue the way they are.  
We have a number of other problems with the bill. 
It does not have the full backing of all the communities. 
Four of the thirteen bands in the province did not sign on to the agreement. 
It was the grassroots people from the communities who expressed reservations.  
The chiefs and their people who were fully on side. 
There was a major concern with the Nova Scotia board of education. 
It would have liked to see this amendment.  
There was a concern with consultation. 
They do not want to see the chiefs constitute the members of the board.  
We have seen these cases before. 
He would be considered an elder in his community forever. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
We know one principle of democracy is that majority rules. 
We have to question the views surrounding the objection to the bill.  
We also hear questions and commentaries, and this is a commentary. 
We have tried to ``civilize''. 
We have tried to ``assimilate''. 
They were well educated, well spoken individuals under the current system. 
People will flourish under a multiplicity of systems.  
This is one that may work very well for these people. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Accordingly the vote stands deferred until tomorrow at approximately 1 p.m. 
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I feel very strongly that it is a faulty process. 
I think the bill came in, in early October. 
Despite that the government moved it directly to committee.  
Yet what we found was an accelerated process even at committee.  
The list goes on. 
We have to look at what these amendments are to accomplish. 
One must question why the double standard. 
I intend later in my presentation to move some subamendments to the five Senate amendments.  
The third Senate amendment deals with the auditor general. 
We applaud this as a tentative first step. 
This amendment does not stipulate that the auditor general must make his findings public. 
A report made simply to the minister is ineffective and inadequate. 
This is a one time opportunity. 
No further audits are stipulated. 
It is simply unacceptable. 
Once again I will be moving a subamendment.  
Therefore I will get to my subamendments.  
The recommendations are not binding whatsoever on the government or on the minister. 
They may or may not be acted on.  
That brings me to moving my subamendments. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment is in order.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is obviously the silly season. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a very reasonable request.  
Mr. Speaker, thank you. 
It is an amendment that would make the legislation better.  
I think it will come back before the House within the next three years.  
I want to speak to the amendments that were put forward. 
I am glad that I finally have an audience. 
This particular amendment was put forward previously. 
However, it did not go far enough. 
It always deals with plebiscite even in the original legislation. 
However, we will support the amendments as put forward. 
A couple of members over there are going to speak to it. 
They are going to tell us why it is so awful to do that.  
It is not going to solve the problems that are out there in the marketplace. 
It is going to exacerbate the problem. 
This has been a very useful exercise. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It is too bad the member was not there. 
He was in his own area. 
It is respected by Canadian farmers. 
It has done well for Canadian farmers since its institution in 1935. 
In essence with the amendments they put forward today that is what they are doing. 
Our export trade is dominated by a few-'' 
They get higher prices.  
That is where it is at. 
The Canadian Wheat Board does give us considerable power.  
Let me come to the audit for a moment. 
Those members talk about wanting the auditor general to audit the books. 
Fully audited financial statements appear in every Canadian Wheat Board annual report.  
That should be all that is required.  
Do we have that information on Cargill Grain? 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
You have made that point before.  
The member said that I had made that point before. 
Yes, certainly I have. 
They are a contradiction in terms.  
I personally support an elected commission. 
They have done well over the years. 
We have appointed commissioners for their expertise in marketing. 
I supported that system.  
Now they are going to have that control with 10 or 15 directors. 
Will they have any real power? 
The answer is clearly yes. 
Contrary to what members opposite are saying, they will have real power. 
That is what the legislation says. 
They are vested with the powers of the corporation.  
The member opposite asks ``What about the CEO?'' 
The Reform Party claims that the board should select the chief executive officer.  
If they do not like the CEO, they just lessen the remuneration. 
It is that simple.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would ask him to keep his intervention short.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
That is the simple fact of the matter.  
Mr. Speaker, I am not at all stung by being called a socialist.  
That is because you are one.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three short questions. 
Why have I lost it?''  
There is freedom under the Canadian Wheat Board. 
There is freedom in this country. 
The member asked a question about Revenue Canada. 
In fact the Senate amendment deals with that. 
I personally do not see it as being necessary. 
All the facts are very visible.  
I will quote a portion of what farmers are saying in the west. 
The president of the National Farmer's Union is Nettie Wiebe. 
I believe some members know her. 
That is what farmers said.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will cover later some of the comments the member made. 
Mr. Speaker, at least the member for Lakeland is getting a little closer. 
I know what is going on in western Canada. 
I spent 17 years organizing in western Canada.  
Where the heck was he when we needed to do that? 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
It has been downhill every since.  
The Senate has pronounced on Bill C-4. 
The process as amended by the Senate has now returned to the House. 
There will be one vote only.  
It will not return to the other place for a further vote.  
In addition to those three Senate amendments there are two recommendations. 
We must work together to make sure that the wheat board has a healthy future.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I will start with the member from the Conservative Party who spoke earlier. 
I wonder why that would be.  
I thought I would make that comment.  
We have in the Reform Party over 20 farmers.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have been accused of not being a grain producer. 
I have also grown barley, wheat and oats. 
How I wish we had a Canadian Wheat Board in P.E.I.- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is now time for the hon. member for Lakeland.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
My apologies, Mr. Speaker. 
I wonder why that is. 
If he did he would not last long as the member for Malpeque.  
I would like to ask him a question. 
I know he cannot reply, which is good. 
I know the answer anyway. 
The member sings the praises of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
I do not think that has ever been the key issue.  
The issue is choice, that it be a voluntary board.  
It is interesting how the member conveniently forgets that fact.  
I will now talk about the three issues I mentioned before. 
That is what there will be in Ontario as a result of the changes made. 
It is crucial and it is in the amendment. 
For that reason alone the amendment should be supported.  
It is not an issue any more. 
The second issue is more transparency within the board. 
That is not the issue. 
We need change within the board that will make it more transparent and more accountable. 
I wish members would listen to that.  
The member who spoke knows that western farmers want these changes. 
Second, would he report to parliament? 
It may be outside what the auditor general is legally mandated to do. 
That is another concern. 
I suggest probably not very much.  
Those are the comments. 
We are going through this debate again. 
I do not think there is any need for me to comment further. 
I look forward to questions from members of the other parties.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
It is a pleasure to speak probably for the last time to this issue. 
They were debating this issue a long time before this member ever reached the House. 
They support the bill but it does not reflect on their constituents one iota. 
It reflects on western farmers and they do not care about western farmers. 
The other two Liberal members from Edmonton remember it. 
They do not care about what the western farmer is going through. 
The whip cracks and they will do it.  
I apologize to them for the noises across the way. 
They do not know any better. 
I hope my fellow farmers will forgive them. 
They cannot help what they do. 
I will not pay any attention to what is going on across the way. 
His number is 403-637-2193. 
They should write it down. 
He would welcome a call from them any time. 
I hope they call him up right this minute to say hello.  
Also they would like to know what it takes to get an effective Senate. 
The Senate went into the western part of the country and talked to the farmers. 
I heard what farmers had to say. 
I took in some of the sessions. 
They are concerned about the Senate.  
I would not want him to lose the number.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Stay on the topic.  
Mr. Speaker, I was just going to where the phones are. 
We do not have phones in here.  
I don't think they understand much. 
The Senate has been in the views of these farmers a failure to them. 
They feel they have been exploited by the larger populations.  
I would advise him to pay close attention.  
Mr. Speaker, I wish you a good summer.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
A number of my colleagues, including the member for Wentworth-Burlington, heard him.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Ottawa Centre approached the Chair a little earlier on this. 
It had been brought up earlier. 
First of all, I called no individual a liar. 
I never talked about any individual.  
Any member who would make a comment like that should apologize to me. 
I will not take back anything I said.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The word ``lie'' is recorded in Hansard . 
It is not a word that is used in this Chamber. 
The hon. member for Wild Rose has had his say. 
As far as I am concerned, the matter is over now. Questions and comments.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The Alberta farmers want dual marketing. 
Members should get that through their heads. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
The member refused to stand up tonight in order to apologize to the House. 
He has disgraced the House one more time. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member cannot answer since he is not in his seat.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would ask the hon. member for Elk Island to withdraw that last remark.  
Mr. Speaker, out of sheer respect for the Chair I withdraw that remark unequivocally.  
I know that they can come up with this plebiscite that was held. 
I appeal to these members who have a power here which they are abusing.  
By a democratic system there are more Liberals in the House than other members. 
I say this as carefully as I can. 
I do not even like using this term but there is a degree of arrogance. 
I am going to deal with the dairy business right now. 
Let us just for a moment say the system was reversed.  
Let us say that parliament was in Alberta. 
Most of them sell the raw milk. 
They could no longer sell to that buyer who gave them the best price. 
I hope the members can now see what would happen to them. 
It is a very serious issue. 
The farmers are saying that.  
What I am doing right now is simply appealing to this government. 
I know the whole democratic system is skewed here. 
He is the one who makes the decision.  
They have to vote according to the party line. 
Yet what we are getting is resistance. 
What we are getting is a lot of laughter and disrespect. 
I want to be honest here. 
That is what we are here for. 
It really should be done.  
He has excellent quality grain. 
It is the most desirable durum wheat in the country.  
But the law prevented him from doing it.  
I am not saying by this that the wheat board does not sell wheat. 
It sells a lot of wheat. 
There are a lot of farmers who are well served by the wheat board. 
There are a lot of farmers who do not get into these crunches. 
It is a drastic limitation of one's personal freedom.  
I do not want to insult them. 
Do what is right in this case. 
Let us look to the future. 
It should not be the case. 
So I appeal for more freedom. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
The hon. member knows that. 
For him to suggest anything different is ridiculous. 
That is built into the bill, he suggested. 
I am sure that would happen.  
As we all know, the auditor general does more than just balance the books. 
Then we have this smoke and mirrors thing with the board. 
There are some elected members and some appointed members. 
It should not be a political thing again from distant Ottawa.  
They are well able to hold it accountable. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
The numbers given by the hon. member for Wild Rose are accurate. 
That is clearly supportive.  
Mr. Speaker, I concur with the statement on the statistics. 
He has been here now for six. 
It is great to see him.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In fact, he is not again. 
But he was for about 30 seconds- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
In terms of the audit I have a question for the member for Elk Island. 
My points still stand regarding what I said earlier.  
It puts out its annual report. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Elk Island has one minute and thirty seconds to respond.  
Mr. Speaker, of course the question is one of accountability. 
This is not sufficient. 
They should have the information available to them. 
I urge the government to correct it.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am astounded at the amount of publicity I am getting here tonight. 
There is a demand for me to speak. 
I hear rumours now that he is to be moved to a different portfolio. 
There was only one resolution allowed on the floor for debate. 
Which one did the Liberal government supported? 
It was the one for legalizing the growing of hemp. 
Is that what happened?  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
That was the way the press reported it. 
After the election we saw what happened. 
He made the comment that the government had held extensive hearings. 
The next thing he talked about was maximizing the profits. 
We call it smut in the grain industry. 
That is the way the speech went from top to bottom. 
The kernel of truth turned into smut.  
I will tell the House exactly why. 
It was the maximization of profits. 
I was shut down. 
I was told I was out of order.  
The court case was going on at the time.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
The court case has been settled. 
The only mandate it had was to orderly market my grain.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
It is to be appealed again, and the minister knows it. 
That stubborn farmer from western Canada does not give up so easy. 
He wants the truth. 
Farmers want the truth.  
I have grown special crops since 1957. 
They should realize that.  
The caller needed three truckloads of organic white, hard wheat. 
He is fed up with this malarkey. 
It does not make sense at all.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
They cannot make ends meet. 
We have been across western Canada twice listening to the farmers. 
The Senate has been across western Canada. 
The farmers want a choice. 
It has been proven in other areas. 
They do not want to listen to what farmers tell them.  
To me there is something wrong. 
If Revenue Canada does not trust me it can audit my books. 
Is that not strange? 
Tell me what is the problem.  
What did Deloitte & Touche do?  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Deloitte & Touche legs eggs and we know what happened to what lays golden eggs. 
Deloitte & Touche is a tremendous firm. 
Why are they not in the report? 
For years the Canadian Wheat Board has denied that it uses commodity exchanges. 
I can show all sorts of records. 
There is no gambling or speculating. 
It plays as much as we can. 
It will not allow farmers to do it. 
Why is that not recorded in its accounts?  
I also asked the minister for it. 
Farmers have been thrown in jail for exporting grain without export permits. 
I said that I could not do anything, that I needed facts, figures and documents. 
One farmer came forward with documents in black and white. 
It cannot distort grains. 
It has to pay the price at which it is graded. 
I said ``Now I have something''. 
What should I do? 
That is the problem we have in our economy today. 
That is why the country is in such terrible shape.  
Nobody is willing to do something about it. 
That is not why I was sent to the House. 
The country was built on honesty, integrity and hard work. 
That is not my idea of a true economy. 
I do not want to be held accountable for it.  
I have done what I thought was right. 
The RCMP cannot touch it.  
What is going on? 
I ain't going to leave this place on that basis. 
They will have to put a bullet in me before I will leave. 
I hope they take that seriously because I am finished yet. 
I hope the minister understands that.  
Thank you and God bless during the holidays.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I sat patiently listening to the debate tonight. 
Francis Fox condoned the seizure of those dishes. 
In the Vancouver area they went around seizing satellite dishes off apartment buildings. 
That group wanted more choice than he could prevent. 
As I said, I am a person who is not a grain farmer. 
There are no western grain farmers on that side of the House. 
I have a question for the member who just finished his speech. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for that question. 
I cannot figure it. 
I do not know why. 
Politically what is being done is dumb. 
The Liberal caucus will not gain any votes by doing what it is doing.  
Western farmers want it. 
Why do they not give it to them?  
It would handle more grain. 
All of a sudden they lost trust in the wheat board.  
When the farmers came to me I started looking into the irregularities. 
I never dreamt of it. 
It did not happen to strangers. 
It happened in my family. 
One actually had better quality wheat. 
That is why I think these people cannot understand. 
We have 101 seats in Ontario. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
That is why they are allowing their farmers to have these options.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Mr. Speaker, I am running out of answers. 
The questions are coming fast and furious.  
Look at the ministers putting in some work or listening. 
After all it is close to midnight.  
We are doing something right on this side. 
I would like to ask unanimous consent from the House to have him reply.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 11.11 p.m.)
