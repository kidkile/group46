PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
COASTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT 
This bill intends to address those issues among others. 
It is time to dispense with the rhetoric and actually do something.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I agree with these petitioners.  
Madam Speaker, Question No. 34 will be answered today. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Summary of Costs ($000s) 
1994/95-1995/96-1996/97-1997/98 to Oct. 27th 
Capital Cost-Nil-467-426-Nil

The above capital figures reflect one time start-up costs.  
Madam Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
I have the honour to present that.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Today there are five. 
In 30 years there will only be three.  
In February 1997 we reached a landmark agreement with the provinces. 
They told the federal and provincial governments to act now. 
Canadians will receive regular statements about their pensions. 
All benefits will remain fully indexed to inflation, except the one-time death benefit. 
The ages of retirement will remain unchanged.  
The changes that are being proposed are moderate and balanced. 
Again, we have listened.  
Critics claim that youth gets a raw deal from these changes. 
Nothing could be farther from the truth. 
Young people can expect to receive $1.80 for every dollar of contributions. 
CPP contributions are savings toward pensions. 
Let us get the facts straight. 
In fact, it is certainly not what is contained in Bill C-2.  
I reiterate that higher CPP contributions are not payroll taxes. 
The reforms that we are proposing will generate important and lasting benefits for Canadians.  
Let me continue with the myths. 
Some hon. members continue to talk about better returns through privatized pensions. 
But they cannot replace public pensions.  
Furthermore, the CPP has the added advantage of having the government stand behind the benefits.  
It is time for them to stop their fiction and fantasy. 
The problems facing our pension system are not unique to Canada. 
Many countries are making changes so their pension systems will also be sustainable. 
It is forward looking and above all it is fair. 
I urge hon. members to give their full support to the bill.  
Bill C-2 does that. 
It does that after consultations with Canadians.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
People on fixed incomes are hit the hardest by this sort of thing. 
They care about fairness. 
They want a scheme that is fair. 
They want value for their money. 
They want real security. 
They want things to be done with integrity.  
First let us talk about fairness. 
That is the reality. 
What could be simpler? 
However it does not fit with any definition of fairness I have ever heard. 
One of our members called it legalized mugging. 
That about sums it up.  
The young people of our country have already inherited a $600 billion national debt. 
It has been shoved on their credit card. 
What this amounts to is taxation without representation. 
Only for a Liberal.  
It is no wonder there is a problem with child poverty. 
The new CPP scheme is unfair in at least three major ways. 
It places the burden of past mismanagement on those least able to object. 
It places the burden of past mismanagement on those least able to pay.  
That letter is from Canadian citizens. 
Sadly these changes fail the test of fairness.  
Let us turn to the question of value. 
They are prudent people. 
Self-employment is the fastest growing sector in our labour market. 
Let us split the difference and say that it is $1.8 million. 
No. For the government trying to cover its tracks? 
Yes, and that is the whole point of the scheme. 
They have calculated the rate of return per year on the value of the contributions. 
Nickels and dimes to start with but eventually totalling millions and then billions. 
A leading social policy analyst calls it taxation by stealth. 
The CPP bill is a good example.  
The Liberals are allowing it to be stealthfully eroded away. 
It is like hiring a mugger to get out of debt.  
We are two young, hard working people struggling to make ends meet. 
We are living in a truck.  
We are not irresponsible. 
This would kill us. 
This is what young Canadians are saying.  
Is that the situation?  
I suggest we think long and hard about the likelihood of that happening.  
How reliable are those assumptions? 
Now we are suddenly told we will get less. 
The fact is the CPP is not a pension plan. 
Political promises change with changes in power. 
They change with changing reality. 
They change with circumstances and with shifts in voter support.  
Who is going to manage all this loot? 
It is going to be 12 hand picked Liberal appointees. 
It will be arm's length. 
There will be prudent management. 
But the reality makes their feel good rhetoric ring hollow.  
That was turned down. 
The auditor is going to be appointed from year to year. 
There was an amendment to make that appointment for a longer period of time. 
That was turned down.  
That was turned down. 
It will be the minister's hand picked appointee. 
I could go on and on. 
Of course regular Canadians are out of luck. 
Yet this fund will soon have a massive proportion of Canada's total equity pool. 
The implications are staggering for its impact on the total economic structure of our country. 
Canadians are by nature not risk takers. 
They prefer stability and security. 
Canadians by nature are not risk takers. 
They prefer stability and security. 
That is how real Canadians feel.  
Does this plan deliver integrity? 
Is it based on honesty? 
Is it sound and well considered? 
Is that not exploitation of the defenceless? 
Where is the integrity there? 
This plan incorporates the Liberal policy of taxation by stealth. 
King John never had it so good.  
``I hope the government is ready to reap the consequences that this will cause. 
It is important therefore to put a couple more points on the record. 
The government did not want to consider other options. 
Of course the Liberal committee did not want to learn anything.  
The point is just be open. 
But no, the Liberals have big plans for the fiscal dividend. 
They want to buy some votes with it. 
They do not really care about using it for good purposes.  
But the CPP premiums this year are already bringing in $14 billion. 
This is an example of one of the finance minister's fabrications.  
It needs to give real security to Canadians. 
It needs to encourage thrift rather than penalize it. 
Instead the Liberals fight to see who can spend the most.  
Other countries are doing this but not in Canada. 
We need management of a fund which is much less vulnerable to political interference. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, thank you and I thank my colleagues. 
Just look at what the people we represent really think about what is happening.  
Canadians deserve no less.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
It will be replaced by the seniors benefit. 
Either we increase contributions substantially or we have to reduce services. 
There was a lot of capital in a great number of companies.  
At the beginning of the sixties, English Canada had almost complete ownership of the capital. 
Again, this is not the case with the Quebec pension plan. 
So, these are the objectives of the bill. 
Eight provinces approved the proposed changes. 
Why did we have to question certain aspects of the plan? 
As I explained earlier, the Quebec government has its own plan. 
Some people have contributed to both plans, over the years. 
That is why this bill warranted considerable attention.  
I worked for 20 years in Quebec's public sector. 
When my generation came on the job market, there were jobs. 
Today, young people beginning in the job market have to struggle. 
We live in a society where individual entrepreneurship is highly valued. 
A number of members of Parliament fall into this category, in fact.  
I can recall the committee work. 
That will not be covered by the minister's decision. 
I hope that the government will be sensitive to these situations and will correct them. 
Now, back to the Canada pension plan investment board bill. 
This would create an unacceptable imbalance.  
A review of the plan will be conducted on a regular basis. 
Reviews will be conducted more often. 
A solution had to be found and, more importantly, applied. 
The basic exemption will remain the same, at its current level. 
This also true for the Quebec pension plan.  
Then there is the disability issue. 
When disabled, people need an income. 
All they did was try to find a form of income that was available. 
However, this caused an imbalance in the plan.  
But that was not the purpose of the plan.  
This reminds me of the overall social vision in Canada. 
We see things differently. 
I would like to give an example. 
People do not all start off with the same opportunities for training and education. 
This bill has gone through several stages. 
I hope that it will not meet with problems in the Senate. 
It is rather singular. 
It is a very revealing example of how politics are in Canada. 
I am strongly against such a situation. 
This bill provides for the proper control mechanisms.  
They will have to do it some other way. 
The role of watchdog will have to be established some other way.  
So there is some protection on that side.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
It is a pay as you go scheme. 
I believe this is a good plan, a good way to go.  
However, with these amendments it has been made more regressive. 
I will get to that in a minute or two.  
It is $600 billion in the hole.  
As I said, we do have some problems with the plan. 
The economy of this country is not as strong as it should be. 
There will be a 73% increase in six years. 
Those are some of the real problems we have with the plan.  
The increase does not have to be that steep or that regressive.  
While this is happening the government is cutting back on benefits by about 10%. 
A preponderance of those people are women, survivors and people obtaining the death benefit. 
All those things will be cut back and made more difficult to obtain. 
That is a real shame.  
These are some of my concerns. 
If we do that there would be massive support right across the country.  
That is the progressive way. 
That is what witnesses said before the committee. 
They did not want to privatize the plan. 
They did not want to get into super RRSPs. 
They did not want to go totally into the marketplace. 
They wanted a more progressive public pension plan. 
That is being greeted with a great deal of glee by them.  
That is not part of the plan.  
The seniors benefit will end the universality of old age pensions. 
It is important to consider that in conjunction with the CPP.  
We want a more progressive Canada pension plan. 
I wave a flag of warning. 
It is no wonder that party speaks for them. 
That is not the way to go. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. member's statements. 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not. 
That is why I said we needed a stronger economy. 
That is what the plan is all about.  
That is the main way of getting the rates down.  
A lot of people are making that kind of salary. 
Senators and MPs make more than that but we subject to that cap. 
That is unfair and should be changed. 
We are flagging that for the next review.  
The Minister of Finance agreed that some of these matters would be looked at. 
He also talked about democracy. 
It represents 500,000 workers. 
Its was not allowed to make a presentation to the committee. 
Yet the council was not allowed to make a presentation before the committee.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Rather than that the government has endeavoured to do it with a piecemeal approach.  
Apparently those other reviews are being held over for another day. 
As a result this is a piecemeal approach which greatly concerns us.  
The government has failed to look at the plans overall. 
It is clear what we are trying to get at. 
There would be a different level of fairness.  
That is not the way it is done any more. 
We certainly welcome that and want to see those living conditions continue to improve.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I would submit that is what past governments have done. 
We require a made in Canada solution. 
The suggestions made by Canadians in consultations are reflected in Bill C-2.  
To deal with his points, he suggests that I favour the American plan. 
To suggest that I want a higher age of retirement, the answer is no. 
That is obviously incorrect. 
We want to have a broader based amount of earnings going into the plan. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
The same goes for the Liberal government. 
They did so with great rigour and honesty. 
We did it assuming that the government would be listening. 
The government did not listen. 
It is the steamroller approach. 
There is a reason for this. 
I see the parliamentary secretary smiling and smirking on the other side of the House. 
I can hear it now. 
But no, this has to be done now. 
Why is the government doing it? 
The government wants it to actually go higher. 
This is the choice it has made.  
This is why the government is trying to ram it through. 
What we have instead is the $600 billion hole. 
The Reform Party said that it would like to have some sort of recognition bond. 
That is a pretty good example of ideology gone haywire. 
I think the NDP and the Bloc would agree as well.  
What did your government do under Mulroney?  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
This is exactly the position we took.  
You guys failed the Canadian people.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
I do not know whether they intend to just stand there and heckle.  
You want to see courtesy? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Let us leave this kind of thing to some other venue. 
Let us leave this kind of debate for another time and another place.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Who are the people that this freeze affects the most? 
We wanted to be constructive in committee. 
Did the government listen to this suggestion? 
The other change I mentioned was with regard to payroll taxes. 
I want to speak specifically to the suggestion that we made through an amendment. 
The member for Markham, our critic, made that suggestion. 
He did it in good faith. 
Yet, the government turned it down. 
On whose backs is it doing it? 
Did it listen to that? 
No. The answer again was ``no''.  
Canada in the global equity market represents about 3% of that market. 
More money keeps pouring into the equity markets. 
Whose money is this, by the way? 
They should be allowed to get the best benefit from that investment. 
They want to nod. 
They are nodding off.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
The member from Hamilton recognizes that they are sleeping again. 
I concur with his view. 
Think of what is going to happen in a very short period of time. 
That is one of the changes we propose. 
So it is not the perfect example.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
No, instead they seem to have got it backward. 
This is not a secondary issue. 
My conclusion is somewhat bleak. 
Personally, I wish the government had listened more carefully to what we had to say. 
We clearly stated our positions during the election campaign. 
It is in black and white in our election platform. 
What does it provide for? 
Create an independent board for investment, independent in the true sense. 
It is about time that we also give them a break.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I see that there are a number of questions and comments. 
I would ask hon. members to keep their questions and responses short.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.  
I listened very carefully to the member for Sherbrooke. 
However, we have created over a million jobs. 
He also talks about making the system sustainable.  
He talked about them in terms of deductions, in terms of payroll taxes. 
He talks about sustainability. 
We are looking toward an era of sustainability.  
He talked about an independent investment fund. 
I do not know where the member has been. 
I know he is in the House today. 
He is often in the House. 
We have already brought forward an independent investment fund.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
I want to use his own words. 
He says he is confused. 
How else could he be confused?  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
An hon. member: -gonna resign.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
The member is shaking his head. 
Is the member confused? 
Yes, he should be confused. 
Is he thoroughly confused? 
Yes, he is thoroughly confused, and I can see why. 
He said we increased employment insurance premiums- 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
That was six months later.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
He stood in his place and voted for a 35%- 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
From 1984 to 1993, there was a Conservative government. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
We discussed such changes with the provincial governments as openly as we could. 
And then there was a change of government. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, but the hon. member has run out of time. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Full benefits were received by pensioners as early as 1970. 
That raises the issue of who is paying for those benefits. 
The important issue was that we had to provide retirement benefits for our seniors. 
Therefore the plan was established on a pay as you go basis.  
It is a very generous plan. 
This is not a mistake. 
It is simply a function of the changes that were made.  
Members should be aware that important changes were made. 
The survivor's benefit was introduced. 
It targets the needs of single women in retirement. 
We must also take into account the aging of our society. 
When the plan started there were eight workers for every one retiree. 
Today there are five workers for every one retiree. 
One of the most important has to do with the principle of intergenerational equity. 
I think that is our job, to do the right thing.  
But it is not just a pension plan. 
In my view Bill C-2 meets those criteria.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I read some letters today in my speech. 
I wish I could have read more. 
I received 4,000 of them, but I had to pick and choose. 
The parliamentary secretary said it correctly. 
She has misled Canadians. 
She has put on the table fearmongering.  
Canadians should have nothing to do with the Reform Party.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is one of the most important social policy initiatives of the last several years.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
I would ask that the member for Mississauga retract those words.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, the member for Mississauga is in the House. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the member is quite right. 
I used those words and I withdraw those words, uncategorically. 
I should have said ``she is mistaken.''  
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
We are well aware of the challenges facing the Canada pension plan. 
Obviously, the demographic problems have been there for a number of years.  
It is in fact an agreement with all of the provinces. 
We have ensured stable and secure funding for the CPP. 
It is important to note, if I can, that the Tories did nothing. 
That is the problem we have with the opposition. 
If the opposition wants to criticize that is perfectly legitimate. 
That is what oppositions are intended to do.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
Madam Speaker, I am quite aware of the Chilean experience. 
The member opposite keeps using it. 
The original plan was in complete disarray. 
There was little similarity between ours and Chile's. 
High inflation was seriously eroding the value of the benefits. 
By contrast, the CPP is portable and nearly universal. 
Everyone receives a fair pension. 
There is a big difference between ours and Chile's.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We argue that people should have a choice. 
We believe in choice.  
Would that not be a nice problem to have?  
I point out that the U.K. has already gone to that plan. 
Let us not scare people. 
Let us not allow the member across the way to scare people. 
I ask my friend in a rhetorical way what has that done for young people? 
What has that done for people who are just starting out? 
This plan really has not worked all that well, I would argue.  
Of course, we have seen premiums not creep up- 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That is not parliamentary language, nor is it acceptable.  
I would appreciate if he would withdraw.  
In fact, I will say it again.  
This is according to the actuary. 
My friend is saying that it is not true. 
In other words, they will get a negative return.  
That is not the least of it. 
How does that affect young people? 
That is what the Liberal government is going to do for young people.  
What about his own government? 
An 80% clawback, how is that fair? 
They have done very poorly as a matter of fact. 
On the one hand, they are penalizing people through the new seniors benefit for saving. 
What has the government done? 
Let us relate the story of the government's record on taxation. 
That is unbelievable to me.  
Government members wonder why we have families living in poverty. 
It is a big mystery to them. 
Maybe the government should look at its tax record. 
This government has a terrible record on taxation. 
They have not gone up one bit. 
My friend across the way can focus on Chile only. 
We say it is time to start looking around. 
Who comprised those 290 people? 
We saw the interest of big business. 
But we did not see ordinary Canadians at these hearings. 
We know where this government is coming from. 
The fix was in right from the beginning.  
Let me just say briefly how we think the government should be going.  
That is absolutely ridiculous. 
We believe that RRSPs should be enhanced. 
We believe that people should be allowed to put more money into RRSPs.  
It is time for tax relief in this country. 
Canadians have spoken on this issue. 
I sit on the finance committee, as do members opposite. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The Reform's program is pretty general. 
It does not get into specifics. 
I would like him to answer those two questions. 
So far all he has given us is the Chile example. 
It is not our system.  
I was referring to countries which have a public pension plan. 
Nine out of ten people will benefit from the seniors benefit. 
One in ten will see a reduction.  
I do not know who the people are who the member is looking at. 
The systems begin in young countries where the proportion of retired people is small. 
Chile is one of them. 
The hon. member asked me about the liability. 
It is so simple that it has eluded our friends across the way. 
Obviously we have not.  
The people who get it right in the neck are the middle income earners. 
Out of fairness, that should be pointed out.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member referred to this as 270 persons having appeared before the panel. 
The member is not only mistaken, he is mistaken in the extreme.  
Why can there not be a separate plan?  
Obviously that is not true. 
So why not separate it out?  
In fact, I think it is an abomination.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
People are having difficulty feeding their children. 
There are no prospects for future employment.  
It would be the same way it works now. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I found that rather interesting.  
I do not care if the member thinks it is funny. 
We want a made in Canada solution. 
We do not need to go to the states.  
I am teasing the bears and they are apparently getting a little agitated. 
Where the policies come from is really quite telling.  
I will be splitting my time with Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
Reformers talk about the fact that there has been no consultation. 
The tactics that are used are interesting. 
It has been debated in committee. 
Members opposite have spoken about it. 
Don't use that word disrespectfully.  
Don't talk about disrespectful. 
That is the mentality we see on that side of the House. 
They should be ashamed of themselves and embarrassed.  
That was the Reform Party. 
Canadians are fed up with that kind of nonsense. 
The investment procedures used by that pension fund were inadequate and unfair. 
The teachers were not happy when we did that. 
They came to Queen's Park. 
They were very unhappy. 
The fund has substantial investments such as investments in newspapers. 
I give that example because it relates. 
This is not rocket science. 
Canadians have investment options for their retirement. 
What do we do? 
We either increase the contributions, reduce the benefits or change the procedures. 
Yes, there will be an increase.  
I do not expect the member to understand. 
I think my colleague was right on. 
I think it will be big business. 
There are rules that guide the investment.  
What is the Royal Bank's profit up to today? 
It is $1.6 billion. 
That is absolutely unbelievable. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The member made absolutely weird comments. 
He does not seem to understand a very simple principle.  
The member misrepresents the Reform position. 
It is really a scandal that he just does not understand. 
Oh, that is going to help.  
Do you have it all figured out now? 
That is what made them scared.  
Has the member learned anything here? 
Madam Speaker, I have learned quite a bit, actually. 
That is what I heard. 
My colleagues, I just caught the tail end of the remarks. 
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
He is survived by his wife Olive and several children and grandchildren. 
MAPLE LEAF PLANT CLOSURE 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, 1,000 jobs lost forever. 
One thousand families face a bleak new year.  
In Edmonton a 90 year old plant was struck and then closed. 
Michael McCain was true to his word. 
Must labour always wield a primordial club of strike? 
Must management always sit resolute awaiting the blow? 
Must our community always suffer in silence?  
Can we do no better than repeat the past? 
Workers and their families want to know. 
Have we not learned at last? 
Sadly I fear the answer is no.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
I congratulate Mr. Ling on his Award of Merit. 
I draw inspiration from his contribution. 
I encourage all Canadians to follow his example of tireless volunteerism.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
The hon. member for St. Paul's.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Alberta is divided into eight zones. 
Provincial success could be the beginning of national and international achievement.  
The games are more than a biannual sporting event. 
They also motivate Albertans to aim for a higher level of physical fitness.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
The pain of this day is still with us. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
The government is sending a mixed message. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
More than 120 nations have signed a treaty to ban land mines.  
Joining us in the gallery today are several land mine survivors. 
They are here representing Canadian survivors. 
They deserve our support.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
They not only handled it but they performed extremely well.  
I would also like to thank their families for their sacrifice and their crucial support.  
And so I say to our peacekeepers, thank you and welcome home.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Another ridiculous decision forced by the mayor of Quebec City.  
We would never agree to criteria for occasional support for our country. 
We should ask the separatists if they want to break up our country occasionally.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
But they cannot do it alone.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
What precisely is the government's debt reduction target?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our target is to have a balanced budget. 
The next budget will tell us by exactly how much.  
The government has a policy that is clear. 
We have a balanced approach. 
We know that we will reduce the debt and taxes- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we were the first. 
We have done it. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
My question is for the prime minister. 
When will this get through to the government?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I took note of that. 
I hope when they come to town next week that they will remember that.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously they touched a nerve.  
When will it leave home without it?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We take our responsibilities seriously.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I think that the hon. member is the champion of confusion.  
In the Calgary declaration, this misunderstanding has been eliminated. 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, I think that the hon. member has a hearing problem.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, national unity is not a partisan matter. 
SABLE ISLAND NATURAL GAS 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the prime minister.  
Does he really want certain regions- 
The Minister of Natural Resources.  
There are some stages yet to go.  
When the final process is completed the appropriate decision will be taken. 
It is not done yet.  
That panel worked for 10 months. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Could the prime minister give us an answer today?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
It is certainly the right decision.  
The minister says yes, thank you.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
However, the premiers are well aware that I am including their suggestions on the agenda. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That is a terrible chunk of change. 
When is he going to give us a deadline for reducing Canada's deadly debt?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there will be a budget in February.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
They know they simply cannot be paying that in their personal lives. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have managed to control the deficit. 
Not only that, last week we reduced the EI premium by 20 cents. 
We have managed to balance the books and reduce taxes. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
This comes from the same member who asked me the question.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in the 1980s the prime minister was energy minister. 
SABLE ISLAND NATURAL GAS 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
That is what we are doing. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the helicopter saga continues.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, all of the preamble is wrong. 
This is no small expenditure but it is an important one. 
We will soon be announcing a new helicopter purchase.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I wonder how much more it is going to cost the Canadian taxpayer. 
This minister is an expert at stalling.  
I know why his government is stalling. 
In fact, we all know why his government is stalling. 
This government has had four years to make this decision. 
When will the minister set aside his own- 
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member wants to tell us which one he wants. 
Everybody else has an opinion.  
That is the kind of decision we are going to make and soon.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our banks are one of the most heavily taxed industries in Canada. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this round of cuts is the final one that the CBC is making. 
These are the last cuts. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Does this fit in with the prime minister's definition of ethical behaviour?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, think about it. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Cooperation. 
Thousands more are in danger of starvation and disease.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
We are also very concerned about the ongoing violence in Somalia.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadian armed forces personnel are due to be withdrawn from Haiti. 
This will significantly increase the chances that they will be attacked and injured or killed. 
My question is for the prime minister. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
As a result, I am very concerned about the safety of the RCMP in Haiti.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
This decision will cost Sept-Iles merchants several million dollars.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is obviously concerned about the state of Canada's highways. 
The federal government has been involved in assisting the provinces since 1919 in highway construction.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has been reading science fiction again. 
He really should stick to the facts. 
The facts of this matter are very clear.  
Mr. Justice Krever's recommendation helps in that regard. 
The development in Quebec is very welcome.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to address my question to the prime minister.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
This issue was raised in the auditor general's report. 
It was a very important report. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
You need a lot of help.  
A lot of help is right.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
It is the taxpayers' money.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
What is happening here?  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
This decision was very much supported by the community.  
TRANSPORTATION OF TOXIC MATERIALS 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
When is the minister and the government going to make an announcement about replacement helicopters? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, of course it will be fair and transparent. 
It is a decision that is going to be made soon. 
That would bring to a close our question period today. 
I am going to go immediately to the question for Thursday.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot speak about Santa Claus because that would be out of order.  
Next Friday remains to be scheduled.  
I have notice of two points of privilege. 
I will hear those in just one moment.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I ask that an order of the day be designated for consideration of the motion.  
MEMBER FOR OKANAGAN-SHUSWAP 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
I have also informed the House leader of the Reform Party.  
It is not a matter which should be dealt with solely by you, Sir. 
Let us hear what the House leader for the opposition has to say.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The hon. member in question is here in the House now. 
His name has been mentioned. 
Perhaps he could clarify the situation.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
There were some words exchanged. 
I left the seat over there to come over here.  
I cannot raise a point of order until I sit in my proper seat. 
Is that not the rule of the House? 
This is when it all happened, Mr. Speaker. 
Surely there was some disorder in the House. 
It is always regrettable when anything like this happens in the House. 
We are getting close to the end of the session. 
Sometimes in the heat of debate words are exchanged. 
I would hope that all hon. members would take this to heart.  
This point is closed.  
I am going to go to a question of privilege. 
I had notice from the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
I am not certain what that irregularity is.  
The committee is seized with the consideration of six others at the moment. 
A decision for that must be made by midnight next Monday. 
I have a point of order from the hon. member for Dewdney-Alouette.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I thank the hon. gentleman for having the courage to recant on this point. 
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
This is not just some monument to enlightened thinking in our past. 
Their concerns were rooted in more than finances.  
They represent a complete and balanced package.  
It launches a plan for the future. 
Three-quarters of those changes are on the financing side of the ledger. 
They respond to the gap between the contribution rates and the benefit payouts. 
We knew that it would be more than Canadians would be willing to pay. 
Therefore, we went to work.  
Then, we will hold the contributions at this rate indefinitely.  
The reality is quite different, and I want to set them straight.  
They are contributions toward pensions. 
They are an investment by Canadians in their own future. 
That is hardly a tax. 
It is planning prudently for tomorrow.  
Let me add more information on this point. 
Let me make another point to show how hollow tax grab claims are. 
Bill C-2 is very, very clear. 
These contributions will not get mixed into some government coffers. 
They will become part of a separate investment fund. 
Opposition parties in this House have consistently avoided providing a comprehensive alternative. 
This government and our counterparts in the eight provincial capitals have a plan. 
It is called Bill C-2 and it is right on the agenda. 
It is the right direction for us to go. 
It represents the complete package that Canadians told us they want.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the member. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
Everybody has their own opinion on what would do for a pension plan. 
Let us look at the realities of this. 
This was a terrible situation for people to be in. 
I have seen that happen to people on the street where I lived. 
This is why this type of plan is necessary. 
There are RRSPs and they will be there in the future. 
This is a social safety net. 
This is a big part of it and Canadians want it. 
I believe it is very necessary, along with RRSPs.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It was one of these Liberal gifts to mankind. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague across the way for his questions.  
The hon. member referred to what the finance minister said. 
We can use all kinds of ways to skirt around this. 
The fact of the matter remains that Canadians believe in this Canada pension plan. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Let us take a look at death benefits. 
The current contribution rate is 5.85%. 
I have a warning for the government about the public pension plan. 
The fourth point I would like to address concerns the auditor of the board. 
All these contributions collected and invested will have to be kept safe. 
What the Bloc Quebecois wants is more fairness. 
One after the other, our big banks are announcing record profits. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The plan came into effect in 1966. 
Benefits started to be paid in 1967. 
In fact full benefits started to be paid by 1970.  
The member raised an interesting point. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my hon. friend in the bloc party. 
I heard of a problem recently. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
When the plan was set up, there were eight contributors for every retiree. 
But it gave its support for the amendments proposed by the federal government. 
It is not too late to take action.  
But that is another problem, and another debate.  
Quebeckers are proud of their Caisse de depot et placement. 
That is its decision.  
You only have a few seconds left.  
I will therefore conclude, Mr. Speaker. 
The sustainability of the plan is also essential for future generations.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on her comments. 
She shows good knowledge of the bill and its intent. 
The support of her party is very much appreciated. 
It is the right thing to do for all Canadians.  
She referred to investment. 
We will have full access to that.  
I am pleased the member raised the issue. 
Except that I feel that this bill does not go far enough.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Today we are speaking of a renewed Canada pension plan. 
This government is a government that listens to youth. 
They have made their views very clear. 
It has become clear that the current plan needs fixing. 
In its current condition it is not viable. 
Changes must be made.  
This requirement is necessary if this plan is to be sustained.  
A new formula is proposed for calculating average yearly earnings for pensionable purposes.  
It may also be seen as a partial insurance.  
Furthermore, the plan provides child benefits to the dependent children of deceased or disabled contributors. 
For many it has become that they cannot afford to make investments.  
The Canada pension plan pools both resources and risks. 
The renewed plan will be fairer, more affordable and sustainable. 
That is what Canadians want. 
That is what young Canadians have told us they want. 
That is what the government has provided.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
They will get out as much as six dollars for every dollar they contribute.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member opposite.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
They would rather go into a different plan.  
I do not know where the Liberals are coming from. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer that question.  
This plan is more than just a retirement plan. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for North Vancouver, on a point of clarification.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair stands corrected. 
I am going to ask members to keep their questions brief. 
In that way we will get more activity in the debate.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
It has proved worthy of our trust over the years. 
However, even the best of plans must change with the times. 
The Canada pension plan is no exception.  
The chief actuary also provided input.  
Their existing pensions will also be protected. 
If they are receiving benefits now, the amount will be unaffected.  
Significant elements of the CPP remain unchanged. 
Third, the age of early, normal or late retirement remains unchanged.  
It will do so in a way that is fair to all.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
If we don't, all these poor people are going to suffer''.  
Here is the brutal fact. 
Therefore, they are not eligible for benefits. 
The government keeps passing it on as if that is not true. 
It keeps trying to connect this. 
I would like a response to that.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, a question for the hon. member opposite.  
What guarantee can the member give me of that?.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
One can only be left with the conclusion that the government is profoundly undemocratic.  
I had some experience in the political arena before I came to the Chamber. 
They believe in the democratic process. 
Our concerns are raised in the Chamber by very serious substantive inclusions in the bill. 
Move on to this century.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
A member across the way suggested that we get into this century. 
After that long struggle I would like to quote what Stanley Knowles said: 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have been listening very carefully to my colleague opposite. 
Could you ask her not to continue to use a prop. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre has one minute to sum up her remarks.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
The Man from Winnipeg North Centre'', written by Susan Mann Trofimenkoff.  
They are based on the values of dignity and security. 
It is about our sense of being a civilized country. 
It is the least we can do. 
The fight will continue.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Two-thirds of the Canadian population agreed.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre in response.  
We have five minutes remaining and two other members have interventions.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I want her to know that I too knew Stanley Knowles. 
I very much admire who he was and what he represented.  
I remind the hon. member that we have had considerable debate on this issue. 
Consultations have been held across the country.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
We had the government refusing to allow for full representation at the committee hearings. 
Many groups were excluded. 
The government refused to address any of our amendments- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Kitchener Centre.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In response, the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
It was turned down. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Kitchener-Waterloo.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Let me also mention Stanley Knowles. 
I have nothing but respect for Stanley Knowles. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will get back to the member for Kitchener-Waterloo.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
To a great many disadvantaged and vulnerable individuals however the new rules will be devastating.  
I would like to repeat that, $1 billion.  
It is unjust to do otherwise.  
Only B.C. and Saskatchewan are opposed. 
Who will be excluded from eligibility? 
Young people in the first three years of employment will not qualify.  
We also know that those supports are disappearing at a great rate. 
That is what we are doing now for our youth.  
You do not get rich on CPP disability. 
But for many who have a limited attachment to the workforce- 
There is that great phrase again.  
So if CPP is cut- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, the hon. member's time has expired. 
It is time now for questions and comments.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We had a year and a half of consultations. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I would like to ask the member a question. 
That is the bottom line. 
We find the money wherever we can, but find it. 
That is all there is to it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
People have been talking about slowing down the process. 
We have been dealing with these changes for a long time.  
The government has done just that. 
For instance, we introduced EI reform. 
Yes, this is true. 
This situation would threaten future prospects of young Canadians.  
We have listened to our constituents. 
We have listened to them. 
Those changes that will affect future retirees are modest. 
This change will only affect benefits payable to future retirees. 
It also brings disability pensioner benefits in line with other Canada pension plan benefits. 
As a result the disability caseload has been substantially reduced. 
There are new guidelines for determining disability. 
We have launched a pilot project to enhance rehabilitation efforts.  
This bill would also adjust the death benefit. 
The formula would reduce the ceiling to $2,500 and freeze it at that level.  
The plan will ensure our seniors are always taken care of. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for her question.  
First, injuries on the job are covered by compensation programs at the provincial level. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The hon. member for Burlington, you were recorded as voting nay. 
I put the question to you:
Were you here when the vote started?  
The member for Burlington will not vote at this time.

Mr. Speaker, NDP members present vote no on this motion.

(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP) moved: 
Phthalates are chemical agents that soften plastics. 
Soft plastic toys containing phthalates are like a sponge. 
It was Greenpeace that brought the issue of phthalates to the attention of Canadians. 
This is what he had to say about phthalates.  
It is time to act.  
I have just quoted the remarks of two European ministers. 
At the moment, Canadian parents have to guess. 
That is not acceptable. 
It is also a public information issue. 
This morning I did a test with our press colleagues. 
Of course, nobody could tell me.  
The problem with phthalates is that they cannot detect it. 
This is why we need labels, in order to know which toys might be dangerous.  
Action must be taken now to protect our children's health.  
We all know how much time it takes to get standards approved. 
That is why I am only asking that toys be labelled. 
Why not just use other plasticisers?  
We often overlook the financial factor in health issues. 
We are talking about diseases for which treatment is expensive. 
Cancer, infertility and liver damage are expensive to treat. 
Prevention always pays off.  
And, of course, there is the human cost. 
Why take such a risk?  
Canada is a sensible country where the well-being of its citizens dominates. 
Why would we be afraid of an informed public? 
The human cost of ingesting phthalates is enormous. 
We are talking about kids with vulnerable bodies who are shaping themselves.  
That is the bottom line. 
That is what we are talking about.  
I stressed the risks associated with phtalates. 
I am not asking that we reinvent the wheel. 
Everyone benefits from toy labelling. 
Let us act now to protect our children's health. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
The second problem concerning the motion is the legislation. 
Again, this would be an unnecessary measure. 
The act formally prohibits certain toxic solvents and substances. 
For this reason, it is difficult for us to support the motion at this time.  
This does not mean however that the government is taking the matter lightly. 
In other words, we are being proactive rather than reactive.  
In fact it becomes unnecessary. 
We have all the mechanisms already in place. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
It is clear the effort to label toys with phthalates will rest with the manufacturers. 
The other consideration has to do with the study performed by Greenpeace. 
I wonder if there have been any other studies done. 
Have toy manufacturers in Europe responded only to this study? 
Have they directly responded at all?  
We know that they are. 
Again, the comments of the hon. member for the NDP would be useful.  
If they are, what is their position on the matter?  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Motion M-85 reads as follows: 
People need to know what phthalates are. 
They are also used in manufacturing various plastic toys. 
Prolonged exposure to phthalates can cause all sorts of problems. 
This is quite a paradox.  
So why Motion M-85? 
Even so, why refuse to indicate this on these products? 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
So I say I commend the member for bringing it in. 
One of my workers and his wife have a new baby. 
I am a little surprised at the government's approach. 
We are not asking for any new huge piece of legislation. 
We have long passed that stage now. 
We say yes, it does cause cancer. 
It is a known fact and now it is accepted.  
Those are my comments. 
There is no need to repeat what has been said. 
I think it is an excellent piece of legislation. 
We in the Conservative caucus will very strongly support this proactive legislation.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I appreciate the words of the hon. member who introduced this bill. 
The debate raises more questions than it answers. 
Actually the word that is used in all these debates is the word ``may''. 
It does not say it does it. 
It says it may do it. 
I suggest to my hon. friend that the credibility of Greenpeace today is zero.  
I have no question of the hon. member's intent. 
We all believe in the protection of children. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
The Austrian government has banned phthalates in toys. 
Health Canada has not asked for labels to identify these dangerous toys. 
The action by Denmark creates an interesting dilemma for the minister. 
Denmark is a nation whose people are considered thoughtful and prudent. 
They have added much to the evolution of modern civilization. 
We in this party applaud Denmark's integrity. 
This government is always talking about international trade. 
Perhaps we could import some Danish integrity to this government. 
Canadians used to rely on something called consumer and corporate affairs. 
The studies are there. 
I urge the minister to act quickly in the interest of all Canadians.  
It is absolutely shameful.  
Not even Health Canada can tell us how long that will take.  
It is the responsibility of Health Canada and the Minister of Health.  
The economic costs associated with health problems from these polluted toys are obvious. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It is very easy to condemn a product when it gets headlines. 
But we have to take a responsible attitude to this problem. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
It is obvious that Canadians need more protection from big banks. 
Big banks do not need more power. 
The Canadian Standards Association cannot protect Canadians from the banks. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I emphasize that the government is planning to build on these actions.  
The hon. member for Vancouver Island North. 
I got mixed up in my reading of the sheet.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
This is bogus and DFO has no supporting evidence for these actions.  
Once again, DFO has managed to politicize fish science. 
The scientific rationale for killing these fish makes no sense. 
Locally, DFO appears to be embarrassed. 
The community wants reassurance that these actions will not be repeated.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think it is time to clear up some facts.  
There is nothing bogus about this decision. 
In fact conservation and science were paramount in that decision.  
Some first nations did not receive a single fish.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
I recognize that this is not enough. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.16 p.m.)
