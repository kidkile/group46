EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 13 
Wednesday, October 8, 1997 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
They are saying the institution is out of control and ready to blow.  
Staff now work in extremely hazardous situations.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
The Newmarket Youth Centre opens its doors next week.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
The riding of Simcoe-Grey is one of the most beautiful areas in Canada. 
Tourism is a significant and vital component of the Simcoe-Grey economy. 
I am proud of the great strides made within the tourism industry within our riding.  
PROVINCIAL RIDING OF DUPLESSIS 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
People of the North Shore- 
I regret having to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Scarborough Centre now has the floor.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
This award recognizes outstanding performance by a smaller exporter in the global forum.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Why, BCE chairman Lynton Wilson. 
So listen up small business. 
Here is how to get preferential treatment from the Liberals. 
It should not have to be that way. 
The Liberal Party is an affront to small business.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Breast cancer has had a profound effect on my own family. 
October is breast cancer awareness month. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
SAGUENAY AND MANITOBA FLOODS 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The last time I checked, this was a democratic country. 
It is obvious today that those Liberals do not believe that.  
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Manitoba flood has changed us forever. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Was it the NDP amendment they were ashamed of? 
They did not want to vote for it, they did not want to discuss it. 
What is going on?  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
That is what he said. 
Now they have cut a cheque so big that Dennis Rodman would blush. 
The hon. solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is always like that.  
We do not intervene in investigations by the RCMP. 
They decide when there will be an investigation. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
The hon. member mixed up a company from Winnipeg with a company from Montreal. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This was only made public five days after the election campaign was over.  
Who was it over on that side? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we check with people well informed about their ridings. 
We check out the reliability of businesses. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The investigation is under way. 
Let the investigation take its course.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the prime minister.  
Is it the prime minister's intention to govern parliament by closure? 
What is it he is trying to hide?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is the reference of legislation to a committee. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, when did the government become afraid of the 301 members elected to represent- 
Yet it is determined to ram the legislation through.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They want to postpone. 
They want to have a vote, to have no debate.  
The government is absolutely committed- 
I am sure we are interested in both the questions and the answers. 
I know all hon. members would want to hear the answer. 
I know I would.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
It is an agreement that the Minister of Finance made with all provincial governments. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
They say it stands for crazy political promises.  
Now the Liberals are cutting off debate after only seven hours. 
They are shutting down the democratic process.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Does CPP really stand for cowardly parliamentary procedure?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The Tories gave us the hated GST. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The issue is why the Reform Party is trying to crush this debate.  
I am having a difficult time hearing the questions and answers.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right now, we just have to let the investigation take its course.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The longer it sits in public the more it stinks. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that debate will be extensive. 
There will be debate in committee and debate in this House.  
Is Reform worried that there will be an examination of its own alternative? 
What is Reform afraid of?  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Dear colleagues, in my opinion, this question is out of order.  
I will permit a second question. 
The first one is not in order.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
We have been told about the procedure for one department. 
I would like to know whether it is the same for other departments.  
These are not just political, but administrative responsibilities, as part of the administrative procedure.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They are based on proposals.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Will they be 13% or will they be higher?  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
This closure ``displays the utter disdain with which the government treats the Canadian people''. 
``I am shocked-This is just terrible. 
Shame on the government''. 
That is what the House leader said in 1991.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Why is he doing the same thing? 
Why is acting like a hypocrite? 
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is sheer bunk. 
There will be debate in committee. 
There will be plenty of opportunity for debate.  
The Reform Party is afraid to state that its plan does not hold water. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Therefore, they are available to everyone. 
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Regulating leasing is the responsibility of the provincial governments. 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
What is the matter over there? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we wanted to have a debate. 
They said ``Let's postpone the debate''. 
We want a debate. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we have been waiting to debate the CPP thing all summer. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I will be very calm, Mr. Speaker. 
They declined to have a debate. 
They are afraid to debate. 
They want to postpone it for six months.  
We want a debate. 
We want to hear witnesses. 
We will have a debate and witnesses will come. 
We will have a CPP that will protect Canadian pensioners in the 21st century.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very clear what has happened. 
I mentioned this in the House the other day.  
There are two ways to destroy the Canada pension plan. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
It is precisely because we want to strengthen it that we want a debate.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
It is on an issue close and dear to the hearts of western Canadian farmers.  
It was then delayed to November and now it is delayed until April. 
Is your department prepared to immediately conduct- 
The hon. member should always address his question to the Chair. 
I will permit the hon. Minister of Transport to reply the preamble.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Even though recruitment has not started we are working toward an early start.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Producers want answers now. 
The minister has the authority but will he have the political will? 
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
Canadians from every part of the country responded generously to appeals for assistance.  
It was a remarkable show of Canadian solidarity. 
It was the finest possible example of team Canada at work.  
THE LATE CLAUDE ELLIS 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
He served two terms in the House. 
He was also a superb educator and teacher. 
Mr. Ellis' interest in politics started very early in life. 
Mr. Ellis is survived by his wife Bessie, three sons and one daughter. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The minister mentioned that he was involved at a very young age. 
He was involved at 16 years old. 
How many of us were thinking and breathing politics at that age? 
He had a pretty remarkable career. 
What a thrill it must have been for that young man.  
He was elected in 1953 and again in 1957. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I had the honour and privilege of knowing Claude Ellis for the last 24 years. 
Throughout that period Bessie and Claude were advisors to me. 
Their experience and counsel were very important to us.  
As citizens we have suffered a great loss as a result of his passing. 
THE LATE MR. J. CHESTER MACRAE 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
People from the Fredericton area will always remember Chester MacRae for his dry wit. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Being the wonderful gentleman that he was, after the election he came to visit me. 
This was the last Remembrance Day before the onset of his illness.  
He was very alert. 
He will be missed. 
All his family and his friends in Fredericton have our condolences.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Chester MacRae worked tirelessly toward the improvement of Canada for future generations.  
For his service he was awarded the Military Cross.  
Chester MacRae will be sorely missed but never forgotten in this House. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. MacRae was considered a hero in the second world war. 
He even took part in the landing in France.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. MacRae was a Progressive Conservative member of Parliament from 1957 to 1972. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We will disagree with each other about that. 
The Reform Party will have its position, as will the NDP. 
The government will have its position, as reflected in the legislation.  
How long did we debate this motion? 
I am aware of the significance of what I am asking you to do. 
I think it is the wrong way to start off this Parliament. 
We were doing just fine. 
We were getting along even though we disagree with each other politically. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I suggest that is what we have happening here today. 
Speaker Fraser felt that the Speaker had a role to play in these matters. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
There are important issues that have to be considered and discussed.  
There was no consultation. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I think the Chair will need to consider two issues. 
Let me take the points in reverse. 
He said it in this House some moments ago. 
That is what he admitted to on the floor of this House.  
It has been alleged that there was no consultation. 
That was after the consultation was held.  
It is the good and appropriate thing to do.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there are two points which must be clarified in the House.  
We want to debate the merits of the bill through our amendments.  
As it happened, yesterday I was at a meeting of the Board of Internal Economy. 
I hardly call that adequate and reasonable notice in this day and age of democracy.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The government House leader has forgotten that number.  
It deals with what the government House leader said. 
He failed to give New Democrats notice of this motion. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have new and relevant information on this issue. 
I am vice-chair of the House of Commons finance committee. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I have not spoken to the bill and I want to speak to the bill.  
Members have asked me to rule on a specific question of privilege. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I did not hear those conversations. 
I do not want to go into a debate on this issue. 
It is just a normal thing that we accept. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):
If I did, there was no intention on my part to be disrespectful to anyone.

Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Just yesterday the auditor general reported his findings to the House. 
Of course, that is a matter of debate right across the country.  
We have had an historic day today. 
It is a matter of urgent public interest.  
They should be heard. 
The hon. member for Burin-St. 
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
BILL C-2-MOTION FOR TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
I don't think you can move that on a point of order.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
He has four minutes remaining in his speech.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
That is utter rubbish and nonsense. 
It is not in any way shape or form a payroll tax.  
Because this has not been a cursory commitment. 
This coruscating Bill C-2 most certainly rises to that challenge. 
May I even be so bold as to say that this is a bodacious bill. 
Hon. members can look up that word.  
I notice I have one minute left, Mr. Speaker. 
One further minute to expound upon the great magnanimous qualities of Bill C-2. 
This bill not only rises to the challenge, it supersedes it. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the last member gave us a history lesson. 
We are $100 billion deeper in debt. 
There are $26 billion in increased taxes. 
Youth unemployment stands at 17%. 
Patronage appointments abound everywhere. 
We have job equity. 
Let us go back in history to 1966 when this experiment in socialism was started. 
We are going to destroy the incentive of these young people. 
We are going to rob them of their jobs because of these payroll tax deductions. 
During the last election I made up a little card. 
This little card refers to exactly what this plan is all about. 
I said to them ``Let us think about what this plan is really about. 
What would be a better way? 
What kind of investment are we asking our young people to make? 
We are asking them to be robbed. 
I would like to read some quotes. 
I really think these are fitting. 
This is just terrible. 
This time we are talking about a major piece of legislation. 
Shame on those Tories across the way for using closure''.  
Mr. Speaker, we agree with you totally. 
I tell you, they should go up in our caucus room because you are right.  
The government will continue to move closure. 
This is just the beginning. 
The last member said ``Hey, this is an honourable place''. 
This place has lost its democratic reason to exist. 
This place is a disgrace because of those people across the way.  
What are the options? 
The government would like us to think that there are none. 
But let us just quickly talk about those. 
Within six years I believe the government will admit it was wrong. 
What are the options? 
The options are obvious. 
Let young people set up a private plan. 
Let us take a look at what Britain is going to be doing. 
It is going to that sort of a plan. 
Australia and New Zealand have already done it. 
Chile has been on that plan for 16 years. 
We have to look at these options. 
We have to present them in the House. 
They need to be debated here, but the government has closed down that option. 
In conclusion, today has been a dark day for our country. 
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
Most of us here campaigned on this. 
It was an issue we discussed in the last Parliament.  
We simply allowed it to transpire. 
We knew that the demographics of this country were changing.  
I am pleased to speak to the issue. 
We are in a period of transition. 
I do not think that what we are doing here is extraordinary.  
That is a commitment that goes to the core of the Liberal Party.  
I noticed a smile from my hon. colleague in the New Democratic Party. 
It is great not to be a rookie. 
The economy is growing. 
That did not just happen by accident.  
I could not put it more eloquently and I terminate on that. 
Let us move ahead with this bill.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Its provisions were improved through the observations and comments made.  
In all, eight provinces, including Quebec, approved the proposed changes. 
Only British Columbia and Saskatchewan abstained.  
There are three main thrusts to the reform. 
This amount includes survivor and disability benefits. 
These increases will be absorbed in part by my generation. 
Will young people also see a decrease in their pension benefits? 
Employment insurance, as it is now known, is a measure that is almost completely inaccessible. 
Finally, poverty is an ever-increasing problem.  
This is cause for concern. 
Markets are opening up increasingly toward Asia. 
I think we shall be able to find a way out, but at what price? 
Tenacity and perseverance will be needed.  
On the contrary, we are delighted with the pension reform. 
Mrs. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
We are facing up to the demographic realities by securing the future of the CPP.  
It has been established by repeated government studies that payouts lagged behind the contributions. 
These are the principal tenets of the CPP that will remain intact. 
Changes will be made to payments of death benefits. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Natural resources are however very unstable. 
The pulp and paper industry has experienced certain difficulties. 
Nevertheless, things in this industry are on a better footing these days.  
The fishing industry is not so well off. 
The Minister of Finance has an odd sense of fairness. 
The New Democratic Party finds this option unacceptable. 
The people of Canada are the ones who will have to live with these changes. 
They must be given an opportunity to express their views. 
With the proposed changes, some people who are currently eligible would no longer be eligible.  
This rapid increase in the contribution rate is a concern for several reasons.  
Let me give an example. 
We must also come to the defence of the universal public pension system. 
The Canadian public pension system is a crucial part of the Canadian social security net. 
The battle against poverty among seniors is far from over. 
Today one of every five elderly persons still lives in poverty. 
We were elected to this House to debate legislation. 
What the Government of Canada has done today is truly shameful.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
The consultation process was very extensive. 
Canadians had no hesitation. 
First, Canadians want the CPP to remain. 
The CPP revenues are not revenues of the Government of Canada. 
It is a balanced approach.  
Clearly the CPP was not sustainable and something had to be done.  
The pay as you go CPP system made sense given those circumstances.  
The pay as you go financing is no longer fair, appropriate and possible. 
At present the CPP has a fund equal to about two years of benefits. 
A higher investment return on the fund will keep contribution rates down.  
This is a very welcome step.  
The option of eliminating the benefit was rejected.  
Stewardship and accountability was a concern that has been responded to. 
Any future improvements will be fully funded.  
There have been criticisms to which I would like to respond. 
Governing is about making choices and sometimes these choices are difficult. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I come from a small business background. 
It is not a limitless pit as the government might feel.  
This is unacceptable to Canadians, especially to young Canadians.  
I feel very badly for their circumstances. 
Trade is a tenet of our party's policy. 
This will create a further disincentive to the creation of jobs.  
This government cannot claim ignorance to these facts. 
My constituents and in particular the small business community have expressed this to me. 
Flexibility of the workforce is very important. 
We do believe in ensuring a sustainable future for the Canada pension plan. 
It takes courage sometimes to make the right decision. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
For the very first time since the 1970s, we see Thornhill put back together again. 
The provincial government had divided Thornhill.  
Thornhill is a vibrant riding with many businesses. 
Within Thornhill is a very young community. 
Many were aware of the need for the plan to be fixed.  
I approached Bill C-2 from the following perspective. 
The first question I asked was, is there a problem? 
The answer to that question is yes, there is a problem. 
The problem is not a new one. 
It has existed for a long time. 
That would not be productive, although it would be true.  
The response of the government has been that there is a problem. 
What did it do about that? 
The first thing it did was consult Canadians to make them aware of the problem. 
They are aware that if it is left untouched and unchanged, the plan will implode. 
It will not be there for future generations.  
It is important that these questions be answered. 
In other words the federal government could not unilaterally make these changes.  
Did they get a national consensus? 
Yes, I believe the governments did. 
The question is on the subamendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the subamendment?  
All those in favour of the subamendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
I declare the subamendment lost.  
The next question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will be please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
The House resumed from October 7 consideration of the motion.  
The question is on the motion.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill referred to a committee) 
(The House adjourned at 7.18 p.m.)
