The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
International Day of Disabled Persons 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson:
Honourable senators, tomorrow, December 3, is International Day of Disabled Persons. 
The Senate of Canada takes part in that celebration.  
It will also soon be available in Braille.  
This document is currently in an early drafting stage.  
This, too, will be ready by February 2000.  
She repeatedly used the pronoun "we". 
Absent are Mrs. Marie Trudeau, and Mrs. Bernadette Quade and Mr. Luc Clairoux.  
I thank Senator Robertson for beginning this initiative.  
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier:
Honourable senators, I speak often of the international Francophonie. 
Consequently, people have asked me what the Francophonie is. 
I was accompanied by my colleague Senator De Bane. 
His response was: "It is France!" 
Honourable senators, I believe this is an accurate definition.  
National Day of Remembrance 
Tenth Anniversary of Tragedy at L'Ecole Polytechnique 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck:
The federal and provincial governments in Canada have also taken recent steps. 
These are positive steps, but there is still much left to be done. 
International Treaty to Ban Land Mines 
Canada-United States Inter-Parliamentary Group 
Fortieth Annual Meeting Held in Quebec City 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein:
More issues unite us than divide us. 
Still, our trade relationship requires constant vigilance and due diligence.  
Manitoba-North Dakota Devil's Lake Diversion 
It is a frightening name for a frightening water project. 
Devil's Lake is highly saline and contains harmful chemicals. 
These fish species belong to the Gulf of Mexico watershed. 
Lake Winnipeg is already under assault. 
Public Service Whistleblowing Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :

Report of Fortieth Annual Meeting Held in Quebec City Tabled 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein:
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Study Matters Related to Its Mandate 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau:
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, December 7, 1999, I shall move: 
That the Committee report no later than December 12, 2000; and 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Engage Services 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau:
Honourable senators, I give notice that, on Tuesday next, December 7, 1999, I shall move: 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau:
Honourable senators, I give notice that, on Tuesday next, December 7, 1999, I shall move: 
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition):
If so, what did he say about the financial situation of his company? 
If it has not heard him, does the committee intend to hear him?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition):
Page 2 of this letter states, in part: 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I wish to thank the honourable senator for his question.  
The government and the minister have clearly set out the principles upon which to act. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver:
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Police and other children managed to cut them down before their actions proved fatal. 
We have communities in crisis all over this country. 
Native children, Canadian children, are killing themselves. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
However, I am not aware of the specific details of the individual incidents. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver:
Is the minister prepared to respond to this request? 
Can it take place within the next several weeks?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I will do what I can to facilitate such a request. 
Federal Funding Transfers to Provinces 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest:
The federal government has huge surpluses. 
The fulfilment of these needs is critical to the well-being of our society. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
You were Minister of Social Affairs. 
Simply increasing funding amounts, in my humble view, is not the answer. 
It is shovelling more into the inexhaustible hole of demand. 
The government has demonstrated significant commitment. 
I am confident it will continue to demonstrate that commitment as we move forward.  
Honourable senators, I do not wish to drag out the debate indefinitely. 
This is how the federal government defines health care priorities. 
That is not its role.  
Ignoring provincial jurisdiction is not acceptable! 
You will not convince our people that this is an acceptable solution. 
What it boils down to is that the federal government is interfering in health care. 
It says that one service is more urgent than another. 
This is not reasonable.  
The federal government has more important things to do at a higher level. 
Its role is to distribute the country's resources. 
The public will not stand for it.  
Honourable senators, the honourable senator is quite right. 
There is a role for the federal government to play. 
That was just for starters.  
Auditor General's Report- Efficacy of Budgetary Long-term Planning 
This is about knowing the long-term implications of government policy decisions. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the attitude of the Auditor General strikes me as reasonable. 
I can understand that. 
That is not wise.  
The example of the pensions is the finest one available. 
Now they are asking the next generation to pay for those pensions. 
That generation will probably receive less benefits than their parents. 
We have to look at the long-term implications. 
The government should make it mandatory to apply such a rule. 
It is a rule of wisdom for good management. 
Every company does it.  
Honourable senators, with respect to the Canada Pension Plan, obviously that is being reviewed. 
It is under the governance of both the federal and provincial governments. 
The record of this particular government has been excellent. 
That is the worst kind of example of what the honourable senator is discussing.  
Luckily, the present Finance Minister and the present government have remedied that situation. 
I know the honourable senator will applaud them for it.

Speech from the Throne 
Motion for address in Reply-Debate Continued 
6th day of resuming debate ) 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
I would be delighted to accompany him.  
Senator Hays, you have done many things in your public life and in the Senate. 
It is becoming a tradition. 
Your predecessor was a president of the Liberal Party, too. 
Your positive contributions to committees here are well known. 
This has lead former premier of Alberta Peter Lougheed to state: 
As Canadian nationalist Peter C. Newman's commented on Mr. Roth's statement: 
Rather, Mr. Newman believes Mr. Roth is saying: 
"I have no choice."  
The government's continued inaction in the face of overwhelming evidence only exacerbates the problem.  
As Marjorie Doyle, of St. John's, Newfoundland, wrote in October: 
Last week's Throne Speech was not addressed to me.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
I thank honourable senators.  
As Senator Andreychuk so succinctly put it in that debate: 
is an immediate crisis.  
In their opinion, at least another $500 million needs to be injected immediately. 
We deserve a government which dares to dream.  
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
The Speech from the Throne reads as follows: 
The well-being of children is dependent on a number of things.  
All Canadian children are entitled to the same services and development facilities.  
They conclude by saying: 
In short, investing in our children is good public policy.  
The third and last point of my presentation concerns population and development. 
The two concepts are mutually reinforcing, although distinct. 
Some years ago, there was a popular French song that said: 
Un enfant ca vous decroche un reve.  
So, honourable senators, let us indulge and dream. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator LeBreton, debate adjourned.  
Medical Decisions Facilitation Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Honourable Senator Lavoie-Roux) 
All their input and their work proved very productive.  
All of our training was focussed on getting people better. 
In fact, the entire medical system is built around the concept of curative care. 
Confusion exists around criminal liability. 
The distinctions are made continuously in our legal system. 
The rights and principles at issue are currently enshrined in our legal system.  
Our society is ill at ease with death. 
We are afraid of it. 
Why should it be otherwise for caregivers? 
They must learn to manage the difficulties and emotions generated by terminal illness. 
Honourable senators, every family in Canada is affected by this issue. 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
I think we owe her the opportunity to address this matter. 
Therefore, I will adjourn the debate in Senator Lavoie-Roux's name.  
International Search or Seizure Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
That tool is the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Section 32 of the Charter provides: 
(1) This Charter applies 
The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
Chief Justice Lamer wrote the following in paragraph 24 of his judgment: 
I would reassure you immediately. 
This bill does not apply extraterritorially. 
This principle marked a major change in the object of the right to privacy. 
Where the search or seizure took place is of no importance.  
That is exactly what Bill S-4 is intended to do. 
Honourable senators, it is clear that each case is unique. 
Honourable senators, in Schreiber , the situation was different. 
It was not unreasonable to require that they respect that law. 
It might therefore result in charges being laid in Canada against a Canadian citizen.  
In his decision, Justice Wetston concluded at page 944 as follows: 
To that argument, I respond as follows. 
We do not know what form such an examination would take. 
It is more appropriate to approach the issue on a principled basis. 
Canadians are protected in Canada by the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. 
Canada has signed 16 such treaties.  
I did not write that definition. 
This bill is therefore restricted to federal laws and regulations. 
The judge varies from province to province. 
Finally, the bill is not retroactive.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
This question goes directly to the heart of the matter. 
I am suggesting that we should correct that.  
Everyone else involved in that set of facts is Canadian. 
I do not know if I am giving you a proper answer to your question. 
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Third Report of Committee-Order Withdrawn 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted to withdraw this order?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
It seems to me we have done this in reverse. 
That should be a decision of the committee.  
Of course, the committee will make the decision. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a question of the Honourable Senator Austin.  
I thank the honourable senator for assisting me in replying to Senator Lynch-Staunton.  
Is that what will happen next Tuesday?  
Honourable senators, whatever will happen next Tuesday will happen. 
Whatever is put on the record by the witness will be put on the record. 
I have, of course, discussed with Senator Kinsella his question of privilege. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
He and I had the opportunity to have a short exchange a few days ago. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, leave has been granted. 
Is it then in order to withdraw the order?  
Religious Freedom in China in Relation to United Nations International Covenants 
Honourable Senator Austin, P.C. ) 
Her comments were based on her own extensive background in religious affairs. 
She has served as the Moderator of the United Church of Canada. 
How to find that balance is an eternal paradox. 
The Chinese are very interested in understanding us. 
Chinese members have visited Ottawa, Winnipeg and Whitehorse. 
Corruption in China is much resented by the lower economic and social levels. 
One great impetus will be given by China's accession to the World Trade Organization. 
The WTO is a rules-based system with a dispute settlement process. 
China has clearly signed on to the principle of rule of law. 
I wish to ask the honourable senator a question. 
I will treat Senator Murray's question as argumentative.  
On motion of Senator Di Nino, debate adjourned.  
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
Hon. Lowell Murray, pursuant to notice of December 1, 1999, moved: 
That the Committee present its report no later than March 31, 2000.  
This amendment was approved unanimously by all members of the committee: 
"with the exception of Fisheries and Oceans Votes 1, 5 and 10; 
That the Committee report no later than March 31, 2000".  
I turn the floor over to my colleagues.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I am wondering if Senator Murray could explain the apparent change in position. 
I would appreciate an answer to that question.  
Honourable senators, I will try to answer. 
As the honourable senator knows, there is not. 
You will recall that a motion had been passed. 
This report was approved unanimously by this chamber on June 16. 
We did it last year. 
We did a good job, questioning the minister. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I want to clarify exactly what is happening here. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Then I think perhaps I should add a few words to the debate.  
It seems to me that we have a few questions here before us. 
They could be described as the larger question and the smaller question. 
We are looking today at the revival of that reference to study the Main Estimates.  
Senator Robichaud is, in essence, asking for a revival of that very reference. 
We must resolve this matter. 
It seems clear that it is the larger question as against the smaller question. 
Having said that, I await Senator Murray's response on this subject. 
It seems to me that that is the issue before us. 
We can settle the larger issue over time.  
The mandates of the committee are very clear. 
There is no reference in the rules to Estimates being sent to any other committee.  
That may cause us problems. 
We decided that that was not the right way to go. 
Perhaps we do need some clarity in the rules.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I fully agree with Senator Carstairs. 
As for the Standing Senate Committee on Fisheries, the rules provide that: 
This is squarely that committee's mandate. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Murray, you have spoken already. 
Is it your intention to move your motion and adjourn the debate?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I should like to make a comment, if I may. 
My view is that our practice has been to send Estimates to certain committees. 
The Library of Parliament Estimates have also been referred.  
Senators may then question anything they wish with regard to that department. 
Under our practices, committees are to study matters referred to them. 
Therefore, this is a question that only the Senate can resolve. 
However, the precedent is certainly there.  
Honourable senators, I do not see any reason why that cannot be done.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, I should like to throw a stick in the spokes. 
On motion of Senator Corbin, debate adjourned.  
Committee Authorized to Permit Electronic Coverage 
Hon. Lowell Murray, pursuant to notice of December 1, 1999, moved: 
Committee Authorized to Engage Services 
Hon. Lowell Murray, pursuant to notice of December 1, 1999, moved: 
Leave Having Been Given to Revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until Monday, December 6, 1999 at 4 p.m.
