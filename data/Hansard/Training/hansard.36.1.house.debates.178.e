ELECTION IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
THE SOUTH ALBERTA REGIMENT 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mrs. Currie is with us in the gallery today.  
Their record indicates that the South Alberta Regiment deserves nothing less.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
The constituents of Winnipeg North-St. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
The health accord is a perfect example of the social union at work. 
Together we are working in the best interests of all Canadians.  
After all, Canada truly is the best country on earth.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I give full credit to both my doctor and TPA. 
I would really encourage Health Canada to make the approval of TPA a priority.  
The government should be in the business of saving lives. 
WHITECAP DAKOTA SIOUX FIRST NATION 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
This agreement is the first of its kind in Saskatchewan. 
2003 CANADA WINTER GAMES 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
We look forward to seeing everyone there in the year 2003.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
The increase was supposed to finance enhanced services in rural Canada. 
Bell Canada, should be ashamed of itself. 
Shame on Bell Canada. 
I say shame on Bell Canada. 
I will continue to repeat this statement as long as the problem is not solved.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government has created a class of working poor in Canada. 
Liberal economics are putting Canadian families and individuals out on the street. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
I invite the Government of Quebec to sign this agreement as soon as possible.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
As Sainte-Beuve put it, ``Happy lovers adapt willingly to any framework''. 
One word, however, is missing from this agreement, inspired by the minister. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
This is the kind of action the Canadian government encourages in the Montreal area.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
It also helps us to meet our Kyoto commitments. 
Congratulations to Stuart Energy Systems for helping us move in the right direction.  
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
She spent more than 10,000 loonies on first class airfare.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
What a humiliating day for our military.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we wanted to go there. 
There was an advance team.  
Unfortunately I could not be there. 
I do not want to blame anybody. 
If there is any blame to give, I am here to take the blame.  
I wanted to go there and I did not make it. 
I am sorry but it is a fact of life.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Now he is blaming the Jordanians and our Canadian air forces.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am sorry, in both French and English.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It is not good enough.  
I ask the hon. member to go to her question, please.  
I would love to, Mr. Speaker. 
Why is the Prime Minister- 
We are going to hear the question right now. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I said that I do not want to blame anybody. 
I said je suis desole. 
I would ask hon. members not to use props.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, General Baril made a statement and I made a statement. 
There is nothing to add. 
There were a lot of other leaders that could not be there. 
In fact, from the Americas, only the President of the United States could go there.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
The Prime Minister has a responsibility to clean the air.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have clearly explained the situation. 
There was no flight for the Prime Minister. 
I wanted to be there. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, once again, the Prime Minister has found a scapegoat. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The Prime Minister apparently did not. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of National Defence were informed accordingly. 
The hon. member for Repentigny.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will explain my calculations.  
And I am not the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The decision was not mine. 
It is as simple as that.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The Prime Minister refused to meet with a delegation of Canada's homeless. 
Why did the Prime Minister refuse to meet with homeless people? 
Why was the RCMP brought in instead?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He is the minister responsible for this problem in the government. 
He was willing to meet with a delegation of the protesters. 
Apparently they are not available this afternoon to meet with him.  
We are very preoccupied with this problem. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Will the Prime Minister admit he was wrong? 
Has the Prime Minister got the decency and the guts to do that?  
It is not a question of any of us having courage in this House. 
I will permit the hon. Prime Minister to answer the question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last year I announced the extension of RRAP. 
The government put in $250 million. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
I have the logs of that plane. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
It paid no attention, and now we can see the results.  
The same is true for employment insurance. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
He is paid to do this, not write books.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, under this government Canadians truly are paying more and getting a lot less.  
That is a lot of groceries. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We have done this in a consistent and responsible manner. 
We will continue in the forthcoming budget this responsible and balanced course.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Where does this minister get off spinning a yarn like that? 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our growth is evidenced by what has happened in terms of jobs. 
Last year Canada created 449,000 brand new jobs. 
In January of this year there were 87,400 brand new jobs.  
This is the type of growth we are proud of.  
FARM SAFETY NET INCOME PROGRAM 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have continuously cut taxes. 
The minister has indicated that our forthcoming budget will have tax cuts as well.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
The reality of living in Canada is that we are paying more and getting less.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
What has it done? 
ABORIGINAL LIVING OFF RESERVE 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
There are fewer than 215 working days until the year 2000. 
They give us assurances that they will be ready for the year 2000.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I would not be cutting seniors pensions the way the Reform Party is. 
We have preserved them.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I subsequently had that proposal very carefully analysed. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. 
Some of those discussions have already been held. 
Some of those discussions have already started.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I did receive a very detailed letter from Mr. Hughes. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, delay, deny and distract. 
In the interests of fairness, will he speak from the heart? 
Will he testify at the APEC hearing?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is entirely between the Prime Minister and the commission.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Millions of dollars are funnelled into Canada every year.  
When is he going to commit to removing it for these environmental terrorists?  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
We as a government are very interested in looking at that.  
This is an area we are very interested in looking at. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
What will be in the budget?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the facts the hon. member is presenting. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
When the Americans are playing the bullies, the minister plays the great nationalist. 
Canadians want some clarity on this issue.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
That being said, we are certainly committed to proceeding with this bill. 
I only hope our American allies choose to also operate in good faith.  
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT BANK OF CANADA 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this government has a double standard. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government has already taken action. 
This is a system that did not exist two years ago. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
They were turned down in a meeting.  
Will he provide the funds in that budget to provide emergency shelters and housing?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her question.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
The second part is about mobility. 
This is an essential element of Canadian citizenship. 
But governments will not be accountable to one another.  
They will share information so as to learn better from one another. 
They will consult one another on their respective priorities and opportunities for co-operation. 
They are committed to more effective co-operation with aboriginal peoples throughout Canada.  
These undertakings set down significant new constraints on the federal government. 
Independent observers in Quebec recognize the significance of these provisions.  
It will be available to him, as it is to all governments.  
The Government of Quebec will be invited to participate in this review. 
Quebeckers and all other Canadians will thus have an opportunity to express their views.  
Quebeckers want their governments to work together.  
The hon. member for Vercheres-Les-Patriotes is absolutely right. 
I was involved in a discussion, therefore missing what was said just then. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
One has to ask how this agreement managed to find signatures on it.  
Quebec's failure to sign on will leave this situation as it stands. 
Why do they fail to mention that? 
Why do they practice photo opportunity politics?  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
I would like to quote the Prime Minister, who said: 
You called on Quebeckers not to let Canada down. 
You have been heard. 
Now I call on you not to let them down.  
This feels strangely familiar in Quebec. 
What is there in this agreement? 
Now there is no longer any attempt at pretence. 
Will that be called into question by such an agreement. 
That remains to be seen, it will depend on the reasonableness test.  
The third point is accountability. 
It was just a year ago that the government introduced the millennium scholarship initiative. 
Would Quebec's priorities in this respect not been different?  
Everyone agrees on that. 
This meant that Quebec could always assert that it did not recognize this federal power.  
The federal government will be able to go ahead with the support of six provinces. 
What does this actually mean? 
There is something very wrong about this. 
Even advocates of the agreement admit that this is a major problem. 
Each time, they have encroached a little bit more.  
Journalist Andrew Coyne wrote as follows: 
``Let us consider what the federal government has gained and what it has given up. 
My time is running out, so I will cut to the conclusion. 
Having analysed all the federal government gains, he says this: 
``You would think the premiers would never sign such a document. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The NDP has long supported the principle of co-operative federalism. 
We do see in the social union a form of asymmetrical federalism by default. 
Perhaps federalism is working in mysterious ways. 
We see here the seeds of a new beginning. 
We hope they will come to fruition.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
The Reformers are once again changing their mind. 
Such is Reform politics. 
It can change at any time, depending on which way the wind blows.  
It is also strange to hear comments about Quebec being isolated. 
As for my Bloc Quebecois friends, they perpetuate historical fears. 
They often talk about traditional demands. 
With respect to the agreement per se, I would have one request. 
This is very important to us. 
That is not the right attitude.  
This agreement can be readily summarized. 
There is an awful lot of stuff in here. 
There was much talk of mechanisms for settling disputes between the federal and provincial governments. 
Point six refers to dispute avoidance and resolution. 
It is said that this must be simple and timely. 
The government is left with maximum flexibility. 
This could perhaps be used as a guideline. 
There is no dispute resolution mechanism. 
That is all we will have for the next three years. 
There will be talk, but no mechanisms.  
I suppose this was written because they had to have a document. 
They wanted more than just two sheets of paper. 
They said ``Social union is something important. 
There must be a bit of meat to it''. 
But when one turns the pages, it does not amount to much.  
What is there in the departments' reports that cannot be found there. 
That is not all right. 
When things go well in Quebec, a comparison is often made with Ontario. 
It is the fault of the federal government. 
The government will not let go its direct spending power. 
It does not even want jurisdictional problems. 
It wants nothing to do with the matter. 
It wants to keep it all for itself. 
There will be jointly funded and managed programs. 
But who will pay what? 
Agreement will be reached at the request of six provinces.  
The same applies to Alberta. 
That is a lot of hot air.  
In conclusion, there is nothing much in that document. 
That is when people need assistance.  
I therefore urge the House to support this bill.  
As a result, Canadian consumers have less than half- 
Perhaps he could very briefly conclude his remarks.  
However the Liberals do not believe in allowing Canadians to exercise that much power.  
The hon. member is going a little beyond a succinct explanation of the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, this is very succinct.

The bill is really not about culture; it is about trade.  
It has the potential to threaten many Canadian jobs.  
She could withdraw the bill at this time. 
Mr. Speaker, I will certainly do that. 
Regardless her amendment is still redundant.  
Trade is really the issue in Bill C-55. 
Our countries share a common boundary, the longest unguarded boundary in the world. 
We share a common continent. 
We move freely about across borders. 
Our friendship is a model for others in the world to follow. 
Yet at times we tend to forget all of this.  
I will try to make my remarks brief. 
The bill represents the views of publishers. 
When the bill was drawn up the advertisers were not even consulted. 
One-half of the equation was not even consulted. 
That omission is enough to withdraw the bill. 
Who did the government consult? 
It was people like Francois de Beaubien and Ted Rogers. 
Do these people need help to defend Canadian culture? 
I believe this magazine bill is a good example of bad legislation. 
The fact is that Canadians do buy Canadian. 
Canadians buy magazines that are published in Canada. 
This proves one thing, that Canadian readers prefer and buy Canadian magazines.  
Let us put this debate in perspective. 
Over $1 billion of trade takes place daily across our borders. 
Canada is the western world's most trade dependent nation. 
Our Japanese market is number two but it is currently on its knees. 
Do we need a trade war? 
Do we want a trade war with our best trading partner? 
No. Do the steelworkers of Hamilton want a trade war? 
Do the textile workers of Montreal want a trade war? 
Do farmers of Canada want a trade war? 
Who wants a trade war? 
I am told a measly $250 million of advertising is at stake.  
Let us look at what is really at stake for the country. 
This tells me that on an annual basis the total is about $350 billion. 
Can we put our country at risk for $250 million? 
There are $350 billion at stake. 
Only a fool would gamble on these types of numbers. 
How real is this threat of retaliation? 
Let us listen to the people of Hamilton. 
They know what it will be like if the steel industry is hit. 
One industry towns like Hamilton take this threat seriously. 
Stelco has made the same plea. 
It is to protect the big magazine publishers like Telemedia and Rogers Communications. 
How many steel jobs would be put at risk in Hamilton?  
There are many other ways to promote Canadian culture. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Motion No. 1 would eliminate clause 1. 
We understand that it is okay for members to sometimes demonstrate a point. 
A pattern was developing. 
It was to delete clause 4. 
Motion No. 5 said that clause 5 of the bill should be deleted. 
We have important amendments that are going to be considered by this place. 
This is contemptuous of the House. 
This is an important bill. 
This bill has to do with the cultural sovereignty of Canada. 
It has to do with important issues within the magazine industry. 
We have to make decisions.  
The Reform Party is having a conference very soon. 
FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS ACT 
BILL C-65-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
This is the act to provide funding to provinces.  
This applies to Bill C-65.  
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The battle waged at this time in Canada goes far beyond the periodical publishing industry. 
Two major principles are at stake.  
This is nothing new. 
What is the purpose of this bill? 
This is not about prohibiting imports of foreign magazines into Canada. 
After this bill is passed, nothing will be changed. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
This kind of bullying is not unique. 
I can categorically say that Canadian culture is not a commodity. 
Margaret Atwood is not a soap pad. 
The Group of Seven is not an international trading cartel. 
Our culture is constantly under attack from south of the border. 
In other words, we will play both sides of every cultural issue''.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Bill C-55 is a very important piece of legislation. 
This exemption was also included in the North American free trade agreement.  
They cannot be solely targeted toward the Canadian market.  
A culture defines one's beliefs and values. 
We are not automatically born with a culture. 
Its leader was busy in private discussions with the former American ambassador.  
All the Reform Party wants is the total cancellation of the bill. 
Naturally we take these threats very seriously. 
Canada has one of the most open markets in the world for imported magazines. 
This bill is not going to close the door on imported magazines. 
This essentially is dumping of U.S. magazines in the Canadian market.  
That is why any threat derived through unfair predatory practices must be challenged. 
That is why I will be supporting this bill.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Figure that one out.  
Why were amendments not introduced to deal with these colossal oversights? 
It is because of politics.  
It should not be just amended, it should be completely done away with. 
How is this legislative sledgehammer supposed to protect Canadian culture? 
By prohibiting Canadians from advertising in American magazines. 
Section 2 of the charter of rights and freedoms states: 
Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: 
How much will it cost us?  
There it is for the world to see. 
Bill C-55 violates another international agreement, namely the NAFTA. 
I wish they would address these four concerns.  
Let me summarize why Bill C-55 should be killed, scrapped and abolished. 
First, it violates the charter of rights and freedoms. 
Second, it violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Third, it violates the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
Fourth, it violates the Canadian bill of rights.  
Any thinking person would realize that this bill does the very opposite. 
The speech I have just given makes that absolutely clear.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
In this article he is speaking about something the French were doing.  
Of course that is the question the Reform Party poses. 
In answering the question, our answer is no.  
This bill congers up a number of spectres. 
What does it cover?'' 
They can go in and do investigations on murder. 
They can go in and search for illegal weapons.  
I agree with the Reform member who spoke before me. 
There can be absolutely no other way. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Forty per cent of our GDP is derived from exports.  
Canada has a relatively small population base and we need trade to survive. 
It is as simple as that.  
A third of all the jobs provided in this country are related to exports. 
There is not anybody here who is not affected by that fact of life. 
I submit we need to make sure that stays.  
Add to that the steel industry. 
We have come a long way with trade liberalization. 
I have already made the case why we need that access. 
It did not do that. 
It did sign NAFTA.  
Do we need protectionism in our cultural industries? 
I would subscribe to that theory. 
Our cultural industries need promotion just like any other industry. 
I have no problem with that aspect at all.  
We absolutely have to make sure that stays. 
What do we have from this minister so far? 
Of course we had to back down. 
This issue will come back to haunt us. 
She is trying to put this issue at a lower level, and rightly so. 
It should be scrapped altogether. 
The Hamilton steel industry has enough problems with the Americans. 
Does Canada have the right to introduce the legislation? 
Of course we do. 
But is it the responsible thing to do? 
That is the question. 
Can our steel industry support having duties applied to it? 
It has had a very dampening effect on jobs.  
We do not have the same tariff. 
They captured a tremendous amount of the American market. 
That is where this should go, to the bottom of Lake Ontario.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It had been approved safe to swim there. 
This is the minister who introduced a ban on the transportation of MMT. 
What could be more ridiculous than that? 
Then we had the flag fiasco. 
How much did that cost us in the end? 
It is unimaginable the waste that goes on.  
A further program she funded was a conference for aboriginals on adolescent issues.  
What a fiasco that was. 
It appears that everything the minister touches turns to poop. 
I know these sorts of complaints come to every member of the House. 
All the things the minister is doing should be based on choice. 
It was exactly the same nonsense we have here. 
TV and radio stations had to have a certain amount of New Zealand content. 
They are a complete and utter failure. 
There will be challenges.  
Let us get that out of the way.  
What have we done here? 
I urge all members to vote against the bill.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
The bill is ticking. 
No. Is it an industry bill? 
The minister is seeking to control an industry. 
Or, is it a foreign affairs and international trade bill? 
These words do not even occur in the bill.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I am referring to Motions Nos. 1 to 22. 
We will have trade retaliation. 
There are nine ports of entry into the United States in my constituency. 
They are all legal. 
Can we believe this? 
I do not know whether the government has clearly thought the bill through. 
This is bound to have severe effects on international trade.  
Let us take the western perspective. 
They do not seem to care. 
The time bomb is ticking away on the bill.  
Let me put it in a different perspective. 
It is a fact. 
Why is it more restrictive? 
This is sheer nonsense. 
We do not need this international squabble looking us in the face.  
What do members think the people out there think? 
They ask if that is the government's priority? 
This bill will not be passed for some time. 
There will be terrible ramifications. 
Pull it right away. 
It has failed in the past several times. 
Let us honour the Canadian's right to compete. 
Let us not try to protect something that can compete. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
It is not about Canadian culture at all. 
Let us look at this promotion. 
It is about dollars and cents as to its repercussions.  
It is our biggest customer and we are its biggest customer. 
I am the chief agriculture critic. 
We are not talking a few million for the publishing trade.  
We are coming up to those talks. 
The cost to agriculture could be gigantic. 
In agriculture we depend on trade for our survival. 
In the fall the agriculture minister was real big on this. 
It was false that the elections were the cause of the trade disputes.  
I urge all members to vote against this bill.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I have a little daughter who is going to be eight tomorrow. 
This is absolute nonsense.  
I suggest that they are not.  
The United States has clearly stated its own position on this matter. 
The government members should listen to this. 
Here is a man who has his ear to the ground in Washington. 
I really wonder whether our government has been listening to him. 
I do not think so. 
There are other instances. 
It was not found anywhere on the west coast.  
This government has a lot of very mixed up priorities. 
This seems to be out of step with what Canadians really desire.  
This bill does not meet those kinds of objectives.  
This bill is fraught with misconceptions and bureaucratic doublespeak.  
I certainly hope this is not what it will come to be.  
We have been told this bill is to protect our Canadian culture. 
My read of this bill does not show the word culture anywhere in its writings. 
Are we going to have them all over the place? 
I suspect so if this bill goes through. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
It is becoming clearer to Canadians all the time. 
She has demonstrated this over and over again. 
Let me give this House some examples.  
Alongside this bill, what has the minister got for a track record? 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Would you please invite the member to do so. 
I am sure he was just warming to a theme.  
Mr. Speaker, that is indeed the case. 
This bill is a case in point.  
The minister professes to care about national unity. 
She professes to care about keeping Canada together. 
We will see the fruits of her labour not too far down the road.  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of privilege. 
The Chair is mindful that members do sometimes make personal comments. 
I have not heard comments that under the rules appear to be unparliamentary. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are continually being interrupted. 
The case before us is really important. 
Canada's trade with the United States is huge. 
It is a very important trade relationship. 
We need them very badly.  
It is not important in terms of our economy. 
We have a huge trade in softwood lumber with the United States.  
It is irresponsible in the extreme. 
Someone should run out and buy the minister a calculator. 
The minister and the government show so much concern for magazines. 
It does not register on their scales, or the minister's scales.  
That is a heritage issue. 
Then maybe they would not be so quick to criticize.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Of course, that is understandable. 
They have nothing concrete to add. 
It is kind of interesting. 
Let us look at what is really happening with the bill. 
We are close to that with this one.  
There is actually one more category. 
Every now and again it comes out with legislation that just does not make sense. 
Let us look at the legislation before us. 
The rest of the publishers in the country are asking what it is doing.  
Why would the government do that? 
It is entirely possible that is what this is about. 
I certainly cannot think of any other reason for it.  
We do not need legislation for that. 
We already have it. 
There goes another excuse for the Liberal Party.  
That is how they sell to their market. 
Have they ever thought of the impact on Canadian producers? 
It is absolutely crazy.  
Let us look at some of the other potential impacts of the bill. 
It will defend itself. 
It will say that we are being unfair to its companies. 
There are rules in place. 
What kinds of things will the Americans retaliate on? 
We have talked about how it might be dumping. 
The government thinks this is dumping and it needs this action.  
Is the government concerned about that? 
I come from a forest reliant riding. 
That is our major employer. 
What did we do? 
All kinds of people in my riding have had problems. 
A lot of people were really opposed to it. 
They are hanging by their fingernails right now on the verge of shutting down. 
They are very close to it. 
We are waiting to see what happens with the quotas coming out in the spring. 
We do not have to look very far for the reasons for that.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is not the first time I have introduced this legislation. 
Indeed the current Prime Minister proclaimed a day called flag day. 
The background of this has a lot of history in this Chamber. 
This of course causes some confusion among people. 
Then there is a string of similar suggestions by the New Democratic Party. 
Stanley Knowles presented this legislation at one time, as did Ian Deans. 
A special consideration for my former professor. 
Mr. Speaker, sitting on either side of you is the Canadian flag. 
I have been very proud of my country and its symbols.  
The flag is more than a simple piece of coloured cloth. 
It is the epitome of who we are as a country. 
It is a symbol. 
Canada is very much a young country. 
It has become the envy of the world. 
This is really about agreements that we make with one another.  
I was talking to some Cape Bretoners last night. 
The flag debate has had a great tradition. 
It was a traumatic event in our history. 
It was a recognition of how we had changed. 
It was not about throwing out our old traditions.  
A lot of people get involved in the monarchy thing. 
Our history cannot be stolen. 
Nobody can steal our traditions. 
I believe that is what the flag does.  
I know some people will suggest what is Canada Day if not that. 
Canada Day is another similar day on which we recognize our country. 
An argument a lot of people will bring is that we cannot afford flag day. 
That is another day off. 
People will not be working. 
Employers will have to pay for it. 
That is a lot of the argument brought up.  
I will touch very briefly on the cost of that. 
It is a fair question and people are going to raise that issue. 
People will say that is a lot of money in lost productivity. 
It represents .16% of our economic activity. 
Members may ask what benefits could there possibly be. 
How is that going to have an economic impact? 
So there is a direct economic benefit to Canadians to have this national holiday.  
In other words, it is over three months without a holiday. 
Winters are long and the days are short. 
I have mentioned Canada Day. 
Invariably the very people we want to interest in this cultural evolution are our youth. 
That is why in my own riding I have been promoting flag day. 
We went to the school and had a ceremony. 
They were very proud of their nation and about who they are.  
That tells something about the emotion people feel about this event.  
I have three ceremonies that I am going to. 
Our biggest problem is supplies. 
We have to find hundreds and hundreds of paper Canadian flags.  
Clearly they are going to be the inheritors of this great nation.  
We just had a debate on Bill C-55. 
I think I have touched on most of the points that I wanted to raise. 
I wish this were a votable motion. 
I see some of my colleagues from the Bloc looking at me very auspiciously. 
It is a great experiment that we are all involved in here. 
We cannot unite under monarchial flags. 
Our flag identifies that purpose.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I have no small touch of history in this place with respect to the flag. 
It never leaves my mind.  
We had very little of what we would call worldly goods. 
Yet here we were in this wonderful country. 
Hopefully they will transmit it to their children, since I now have three grandchildren. 
I remember one of our neighbours, a person by the name of Mr. Payne. 
Our Canadian flag is not without its history. 
We have made that transition. 
There are some who say it is our health care system. 
We have other symbols. 
For example, the governing party of Canada. 
Does it unify us? 
We have other symbols, such as our governor general. 
I do not want to in any way denigrate the position or the person. 
However, it is not a huge unifying force.  
Then I think of Her Majesty the Queen. 
To explain it I want to give a little analogy. 
Again I think of the stories my grandfather told. 
They were legislated into allegiance to their country. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
We already have a flag day.  
So flag day has a bit of a blot on it in our history. 
So there are holidays the following week.  
It is hard to celebrate in the middle of the summer. 
Personally, I am old enough to remember how the Canadian flag came to be. 
Oceans sure ain't what they used to be.  
We Quebeckers have our journee du drapeau and it is a day when we celebrate. 
But I do not see why it should be made a statutory holiday.  
Canada has given itself many opportunities to promote its flag. 
The minister distributed flags all over the country. 
The flag is, of course, a symbol for a country. 
It must be something that people are proud of.  
This is how I was raised. 
I have always respected the flag. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
I must say that I have some concerns with the name.  
However, do we need a day to commemorate the flag? 
I agree that Canadians should recognize their roots and their symbolic heritage. 
It is very important for us to draw strength from our roots. 
We need to find inspiration and guidance from the people who came before us. 
But I think that each of us looks to different people for inspiration.  
I have found inspiration in an early suffragette named Francis Beynon. 
She was a journalist in Winnipeg in the 1910s. 
She worked for a newspaper called Women Grain Growers . 
Francis Beynon taught women a lot about their rights. 
She was very involved in the struggle to get the first vote for women. 
Francis Beynon showed her patriotism not in her flag, but in her actions. 
It was not a popular stand. 
She also fought against conscription. 
I respect and find inspiration in people like Francis Beynon. 
Other people might look to someone like Agnes MacPhail for inspiration. 
As we walk in the door every day we see the statue of Agnes MacPhail. 
She was the first woman member of parliament. 
She served in the House from 1921 until 1940. 
She was a very important woman in Canadian history. 
Maybe we should have an Agnes MacPhail day.  
She was a famous musician in our country. 
She was born into a musical family and taught choir in her church. 
I believe we should all celebrate our roots and our ancestors. 
They are the root to our patriotism. 
We should be helping young Canadians to find inspiration wherever they can. 
We accept the fact that we all have ancestors who we gain strength from. 
We should try to recognize them in a public way. 
I do not think that is a wise option. 
Instead, I suggest that we have an ancestor day.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Most Canadians would agree with these sentiments.  
It is the embodiment of what we have achieved together as a nation. 
Obviously I am referring to July 1, Canada Day.  
Canadians want to show their pride in their country. 
Like many of our fellow citizens, I have had the opportunity to travel abroad. 
Canada is highly regarded abroad.  
On November 11 we celebrate Remembrance Day. 
It is because of them that we can fly our Canadian flag. 
Can the Canadian economy support another holiday? 
Canadian taxpayers may already believe there are too many holidays. 
Our fragile economy continues to struggle from the effects of high taxes and high unemployment. 
These are serious problems that Canadian taxpayers are facing on a daily basis. 
I commend him for that. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I agree that flag day is an important day and that it should be recognized.  
The flag is what symbolizes our nation. 
It is bold and represents our strength as a country. 
Compared to those of other countries, our flag is quite young. 
We have repatriated our Constitution. 
All under our own flag.  
Canada truly is the greatest country in the world. 
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Durham. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think we have had a very useful debate today.  
The members of the Bloc will not necessarily be supportive of the legislation. 
Similarly the New Democratic Party has its own wish list. 
It wants to recognize the women's movement. 
If one is a Christian why should there be a Christian holiday called Christmas? 
The debate in the House is amazing. 
My concern was that it was not a votable motion. 
It would be great to carry on this debate for another two hours. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
This is no time to lower qualifications for inspectors. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The number of positions has continually been growing. 
We were in receipt of an interim report and the results were very positive.  
I look forward to making the final report public in the near future- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. parliamentary secretary but his time has expired.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.15 p.m.)
