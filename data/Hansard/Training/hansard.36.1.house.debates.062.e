EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 62 
Wednesday, February 18, 1998 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Have you heard that the Pied Piper is back?  
But this time he has a new tack, 
No pipes or sweet tunes, 
Instead tales of great boons, 
Yet where is the relief from tax?  
Zero deficit is his sweet call, 
But he is still not divulging all, 
For while the call is to play, 
Canadians must still pay, 
And hope in vain for their windfall.  
While he sings of finance reborn, 
St. Albert is still so forlorn, 
``Tax relief, not new buys, 
And so, I bid you beware, 
Of the piper of finance, if you dare, 
His song is so nice, 
But you had better look twice, 
Or you may end up in tax despair.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Ford Motor Company of Canada and Bell- 
The hon. member for St. Paul's.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
The Legacy of Women's College Hospital at Roy Thompson Hall.  
The famous five worked to get women the vote. 
I applaud Women's College Hospital and Organon Canada for the creation of this award. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
On February 11, 1998 Harold Godfrey of Cornwall, P.E.I. passed away. 
Harold started farming at the early age of 14. 
Harold Godfrey was a strong and active supporter of farm organizations. 
Harold was an active member of his community and his church. 
ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Now Ontario has joined the movement for democracy in government.  
The message is clear. 
Government by appointment is clearly outdated, undemocratic and unacceptable. 
Canadians want effective, elected and accountable representation.  
Senator Thompson's second hearing is tonight. 
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
In solidarity with Quebec, these women believe in freedom and democracy. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
His unique down-home charm has tickled the funny bones of people of all ages.  
He has thrilled world leaders and brought cheer to our troops overseas.  
Colleagues, please join me in congratulating Gordie Tapp. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The heritage minister is accompanied by Conservative, Bloc and Liberal members of Parliament. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
For them, effort and perseverance were more than mere words. 
Are they not champions merely by making it to the Olympics?  
They are the pride of our country.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
That is too high a price to pay.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
CANADIAN WOMEN'S OLYMPIC HOCKEY TEAM 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Indeed Canadians have come to expect nothing less than the best from our hockey heroes.  
I had the opportunity to view portions of this gold medal game. 
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
My congratulations to Eric Bedard for an exceptional performance. 
Congratulations, Eric, and good luck in the relay.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
On March 31, 1995 Newfoundland had 6,440 federal employees. 
What has that cost Newfoundland? 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The finance minister is breaking the Prime Minister's promise. 
What is the Prime Minister going to do about it?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister will read from the red book. 
That is the Liberal program which we ran on during the last election.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
It is just like the GST promise.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is very clear, very simple and very Liberal.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians watch members of the Reform Party. 
One day they are for debt reduction. 
The next day they are for tax reduction. 
They change all the time. 
They do not know.  
For us it is very clear. 
It is very simple.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Now he has just admitted that he is crying wolf again. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We will do the right thing for Canada. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister talks about social programs. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I would ask the Prime Minister to tell us what the government's position is. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government's position is very well known. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It will be up to the supreme court to decide. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the government is getting more and more mired in its contractions every day.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on the reference, Quebec federalists are repudiating the government. 
The Conservatives and the NDP are repudiating the government. 
The Canadian Labour Congress is repudiating the government. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
I would like to inquire today about the health of the finance minister. 
My question for the Prime Minister is straightforward. 
Is the finance minister well?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, he is in extremely good shape just like the finances of the nation.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
The hon. the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, student debt is a problem of enormous concern to the government. 
The hon. leader of the Conservative Party.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to help the Prime Minister today. 
He is recognizing that the student debt problem is an extremely important problem. 
It has been assessed at FMC.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are preoccupied. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as usual Reform members do not have their facts right. 
The record of the government is one of commitment to lifelong learning. 
We have announced a number of measures this time.  
With regard to employers providing training, we actually encourage employers to provide training. 
They can and they do. 
He should get his facts right.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been an employer. 
I have been there. 
Employers right across the country send their employees on courses.  
The hon. member should get his facts right and do his research. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Canadians are entitled to receive aid from their federal government. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that is another question. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Why is the government turning the Canadian army into the Salvation Army?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is always looking at information that is quite old.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It sounds like the same question again, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, one thing is clear: the allegations are completely unfounded. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, absolutely not. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Why is he allowed to do that?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have replied to this question time and time again.  
And so said Mr. Howard Wilson yesterday in front of the committee.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is absolutely wrong. 
This bill was sponsored by the finance minister himself. 
He himself stands to profit from this legislation.  
You can trust us. 
That was his investigation.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
What is the use of an ethics counsellor if he approves unethical behaviour?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
For me it is very clear.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been answering that question for two weeks now. 
The Minister of Finance has taken all of the necessary steps- 
It is clear cut.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Yes, Mr. Speaker, we can give that assurance. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the facts are clear. 
His entire investigation was kept in house.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been in this House for quite a long time. 
The people of Canada elected me here 11 times.  
That is what we see today.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
The bill provided for clear benefits that could accrue to his own company.  
The hon. member for Vancouver East.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member for supporting the program. 
We have done it before.  
I am happy to see that this member will be supporting us on that.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
The millennium fund is for future students. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have been working. 
There was some provision last year to help students. 
Now it is only six days.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
What is the Prime Minister prepared to do for today's students?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That was the first priority, to put order in the finances of the nation. 
We have done it in our dealings with the problems of the nation.  
It was no fun.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We have an obligation to perform our services in an efficient and effective fashion. 
That is what we can do with the alternative service delivery program.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
On Tuesday he referred to clearing up ambiguities. 
What about a clear and honest answer today? 
How many more ambiguities are there, 100, 1,000, or 10,000?  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I responded yesterday to the matter the hon. member has brought forward. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):
That is what this government has been committed to doing since 1993. 
It is a house of hacks, flacks and bagmen. 
If he does that I assure him of our support.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have always been in favour of reforming the Senate. 
We cannot ignore his testimony. 
Why did he not contact a tax expert?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
``One thing is clear'', he said, ``the allegations are completely unfounded. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Nepean-Carleton for his question.  
We wish them well in that voyage.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The powers and the numbers are subject to constitutional changes. 
We are willing to do that when the provinces are ready.  
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of Indian affairs.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
First of all, it is two years old. 
Second, the contents of the memo are not considered to be protected. 
Third, the name of the requester is not in the letter.  
The letter in question is, in fact, context and only context about the information request.  
SPONSORSHIP OF SPORTS AND CULTURAL EVENTS 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are working on them and we are getting there. 
We will act when we are ready.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
This is the subject of my remarks to you.  
The chair refused any witnesses.  
The member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot also asked to have the ethics commissioner testify. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
An appeal can be made to the committee as a whole. 
Article 760(3) states: 
This is from the Journals of December 4, 1973.  
I also want to remind you, Mr. Speaker, of article 760(4) which states: 
Then again there is not an instance where the Speaker personally intervened in that.  
The two points I want to summarize are:
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
It is a very serious issue.  
He has taken it to heart.  
I simply want to make the same point. 
In this case the allegations that are being made are extraordinarily serious. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
Allegations have been made. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
We support this point of order. 
In lieu of that, the committee needs to have the ability to investigate the matter.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I first raised this matter yesterday after question period. 
I have reviewed the videotape and it clearly shows the minister quoting from the document. 
I have reviewed Hansard which indicates the exact statement in question in quotation marks.  
I believe the member mentioned the hon. minister of fisheries. 
Mr. Speaker, I owe the minister of fisheries an apology. 
I intended to say the Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I want to put that particular part to one side. 
With regard to the hon. member misnaming a minister, that is regrettable. 
I could understand the minister of fisheries reacting to it. 
I do not know that he quoted necessarily from a document. 
I might have misunderstood. 
How do we get to the bottom of this? 
I was saying that the minister is not here. 
I put this question to the government House leader. 
Does he have direct and specific information about this document?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I do not expect to delay this at all. 
To make it conditional like that does not make it any more acceptable.  
I have Hansard from yesterday. 
That could be an error on the part of Hansard . 
We will question him. 
If indeed he did quote from a document, I am sure he will tell us. 
Then we will proceed from there.  
It is not parliamentary for us to accuse each other of telling untruths. 
My understanding is that there was no accusation made of an individual. 
Does the hon. member have more information to give us?  
I simply point that out.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That is a telling tale in itself.  
The hon. member is right, this is becoming a saga. 
I have given an undertaking to this House. 
I will fulfill that undertaking and I will get back to the House.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a point of order under the item Statements by Ministers. 
GRANT EXPENDITURE REPORT ACT 
TRANSFER OF OFFENDERS ACT 
This bill was developed in conjunction with amendments to the Immigration Act. 
This bill will assist the crown in the removal of such criminals.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two motions today. 
The motion I believe is on the Notice Paper. 
Why is he rising on motions today? 
Could he explain that to the Chair, please.  
I call for unanimous consent, Mr. Speaker. 
What is he asking for unanimous consent to do?  
To pass the following motion.  
This is so we can move our foreign policy from dealing with conflict- 
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
The hon. deputy government whip, on a point of order.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
There is no consent.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):

(d) See part (c).  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all other questions stand.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It appears on the Order Paper as Question No. 21.  
I would reiterate that this is an unnecessary delay. 
Mr. Speaker, I have made a note of the hon. member's request. 
I will seek information on Question No. 21.  
I am sure that the parliamentary secretary will want to take this under advisement.  
Mr. Speaker, as I said, I will take it under advisement.  
I would say to the hon. member, however, that I regret the delay.  
Is it agreed that all remaining questions be allowed to stand?  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will take the hon. member's request under advisement. 
I will get back to him as soon as possible.  
ALLOTTED DAY-BRAIN DRAIN 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC) moved: 
The government likes to quote all these economic indicators. 
What does this record include? 
The fact is that disposable income continues to go down in Canada. 
Youth unemployment went up in the last month. 
Poverty is more pronounced today than it was. 
Canadians are saving less. 
Let me mention a statistic, a number that tells the story. 
My colleagues will actually be surprised by this number. 
The wrong choices have been made.  
Unemployment among young people is at unacceptable levels. 
That is what we need. 
This country has been on its heels and on the brakes. 
Now is the time we allow Canadians to earn more money. 
This should not be a foreign argument to the people in this House.  
This government should be able to understand that.  
The first thing we have to do is reduce taxes. 
That is what will produce jobs in this country.  
I want to make our position clear. 
What kind of tax breaks do they deserve? 
The first people who should benefit are lower income Canadians. 
That would allow us to take thousands of Canadians off the tax rolls. 
By the way, we are not the only ones who believe this. 
We need to reduce employment insurance premiums. 
This is done at the expense of jobs and the unemployed. 
I see the minister laughing. 
He thinks it is laughable that Canadians are unemployed. 
Now he is talking.  
That surtax came upon us because there was a deficit. 
If the deficit is gone the tax should go.  
We also need to index the child tax benefits. 
The Prime Minister talks about the millennium fund. 
Every member of this House has heard about the number one priority for students today. 
The member for St. John's West has heard about it. 
There is a reason for this problem. 
We are losing the best and brightest. 
The hon. member's correction is duly noted. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I compliment the Reform Party at this time. 
This government has reduced the deficit and will reduce the deficit to zero. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the member talk about arguments being genuine. 
It is the same thing for helicopters.  
Let us for a moment forget our partisan positions. 
I quote from a memo written to the Minister of Finance by Nesbitt Burns. 
This was written to the minister with regard to advice for the upcoming budget: 
It is because of the free trade agreement established in 1988.  
The same memo states: 
That is from major financial institution in the country. 
That is the response it is giving to this Liberal member. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
We talk about the brain drain and I hear people laugh at that. 
I was visiting family over the weekend. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his kind words. 
He did not say them in any partisan tone. 
I hope the whole debate is that way. 
What he says is pretty compelling. 
The Liberals can laugh all they want. 
I see them laughing on the other side. 
I do not think it is a laughing matter.  
The hon. member will appreciate that his time is expired.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, good government means looking ahead. 
Good government means recognizing trends, especially in a global environment.  
The February 14 issue of the Globe and Mail said: 
We have watched our young people move to central Canada, for instance, to seek opportunities. 
It is very sad.  
This phenomenon now exists throughout Canada. 
The romantic thought that they will return some day just does not happen.  
With the right income that can be bought elsewhere. 
That is exactly what is happening.  
Effectively Canadians are paying one-third more in income taxes than Americans. 
We need tax reduction. 
We have to ask ourselves that hard question. 
It is fundamentally wrong. 
It is creating a direct disincentive to work and employment. 
That has been demonstrated internationally. 
Policy does not need to be created in a vacuum. 
It is now a national phenomenon.  
Nova Scotia is the cradle of higher education in Canada. 
The amendment to the motion is in order.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was watching along here and there was no one smiling at the time.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I found the hon. member's comments rather interesting. 
I am sorry but I did smile.  
I smiled because the GST was introduced by- 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
At the same time it is shortsighted and really incomplete.  
Many of the brains that are drained from Canada- 
The hon. member for Kings-Hants.  
I take the hon. member's suggestion very seriously. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Microsoft is now recruiting people in Canada to stay in Canada. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
In addition, the social fabric of the U.S. does not respect- 
The hon. member for Kings-Hants.  
He obviously knows something that ordinary Canadians do not.  
Canadians are making decisions and voting with their feet. 
They are going to the U.S. because the level of taxation is lower. 
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
The Tories have a very selective memory. 
We will just point toward the future''.  
No, they do not look toward that. 
What they look toward is the United States.  
It is total hypocrisy. 
What does not help the country is voting with the separatists.  
But let us return to the debate. 
Again, there is faulty memory.  
It was around $38 billion in 1984. 
Boy, they worked to bring it down. 
They had policies to bring that deficit down. 
They were going to clean up the finances of the country. 
Had they made progress on it? 
Yes, they made progress right up to $41 billion. 
That is the progress that they made. 
In the process of doing that they more than doubled the national debt. 
The balance sheet is not the only thing we ought to be looking at. 
I know the Tories certainly do not want to look at it. 
We have made some progress but it is certainly not enough yet. 
Let us make that comparison in job creation. 
Most are in the private sector and most are full time. 
What happened in the last four years of the Tory government? 
Increasingly better economic ideas have meant a better country economically for the people of Canada.  
Let us talk about taxation for a minute. 
We believe in reducing taxes. 
In fact the last budget saw a number of significant tax decreases. 
I want everybody to listen to this because this is almost unbelievable. 
What would that mean? 
That is their idea of progressive tax reduction.  
We have restored the health of the nation's finances. 
We have seen employment increase. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has a penchant for quoting publications. 
It is a penchant I share as well. 
One of the publications I enjoy is the Economist . 
For $172 a year he could be similarly well informed. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I thought it was concerned with identifying reasons for losing them.  
This government has taken very specific measures.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
I cannot believe it. 
But the member has a point. 
He had nine years to do it and he did not.  
I will let them deal with that on their own.  
The record is very clear. 
This government has managed to bring the deficit probably down to zero. 
We have made a commitment to debt reduction and tax reduction. 
We will invest in the types of programs Canadians believe in. 
I erroneously told him he had 20 minutes. 
He has 10 minutes to speak.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The members of the Conservative Party have raised an important issue. 
When we are in Parliament we are supposed to be providing leadership to the country. 
That is a pretty important point. 
It took a 100 years for the debt to accumulate to $13 billion. 
In 1984 Canadians across the country said they had had it. 
They did not want to have anymore debt. 
At that point they decided to elect the Conservatives. 
They said they would give the Conservatives a try. 
We had Conservatives around the cabinet table from Alberta. 
We saw the debt continue to mount. 
We said in Alberta with one voice you have to stop this. 
But the debt continued to mount. 
What does conservative mean? 
What does it mean in that context. 
We saw the debt mount by $300 billion under its watch alone. 
Obviously it was not the answer.  
Liberals jump in and say they have done a wonderful job. 
They have added another $100 billion to the debt. 
What is their plan? 
Their plan, after 30 years of deficits, is to start spending again. 
I find that extraordinarily frightening. 
It is absolutely imprudent. 
Ten years ago it started to fall. 
Canada has fallen from third spot to twelfth spot in the world. 
I am amazed that this has not been more of an issue today.  
I know my friends opposite will talk about job creation. 
They have created some jobs.  
These are the people who are paying the highest price. 
Those people were doing their level best. 
They were barely making it. 
They were still paying $3,000 a year in federal income tax.  
We can ease the tax burden on low income Canadians. 
We need to start doing that.  
The answer is not more government programs. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
In the past it spoke continuously about across the board tax cuts.  
We have made that very clear. 
The government should be ashamed of that action.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
My question for the hon. member is related to regional economic development. 
I would like to know the member's position on regional economic development programs.  
Mr. Speaker, I think that is a fair question.  
Our belief is that regional development programs have failed miserably. 
We take a different approach. 
We believe first that we should lower taxes across the country. 
It just has not worked in the past.  
The hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
The member repeatedly said the debt should have priority. 
He said that over and over again. 
It discusses only tax cuts.  
Is he not in a contradiction here?  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try keep my question short. 
I congratulate my friend on a great intervention. 
I think he put it forward very well.  
But now we are going to go to the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
We could take these savings and move them over to the SMBs. 
Two billion dollars is not trifling matter. 
These cuts will take place every year until 2003. 
But that is another story.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
We are talking about a small number.  
They have an average unemployment rate of some 23%. 
Mr. Speaker, what I am proposing is very simple. 
I think it is easy to figure out.  
What would I do in their shoes? 
First, I would start by minding my own business. 
Education is an area of provincial jurisdiction. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will continue to try to participate in the debate. 
I hear examples of it over and over again.  
I am speaking in support of the motion. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have a chance to participate in today's debate. 
To me it does not make much sense at all. 
First, the motion refers to the brain drain. 
Do we actually have a brain drain in this country? 
In 1996, 42,600 knowledge workers came to Canada.  
So set that aside.  
This is not a particularly unique idea. 
Sixteen of the OECD countries already are tuition free. 
Why not have tuition free universities and colleges? 
We have a choice. 
This is what the business of politics is all about. 
This would cover the cost of tuition fees for every student in this country.  
It seems to me that would be worthy of some consideration.  
We are going to have a budget in a few days. 
Canadians said ``We have had it with these guys. 
We are going to toss them out so far that we can hardly see them''. 
Now there is a little group down at the far end. 
We have always been a small group at this end. 
Nothing changes particularly for us.  
Then it changed and now it is Liberals. 
Somebody said the other day it is like having the Titanic economy. 
Things have probably never been better for them. 
It is interested in labour. 
What was the name of the conference? 
She was doing well. 
Then they experienced layoffs in the business. 
It really fails to deal with the crucial issues confronting our country. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated what the member had to say. 
I cannot agree with everything of course. 
I used to support the NDP at one point earlier in my life. 
Why are the young people leaving Saskatchewan? It is plain and simple. 
There are not any jobs available for them. 
Very few jobs are being created in that province.  
Why are there very few job opportunities? 
Saskatchewan has the highest taxes in the country. 
Let us lay politics aside. 
Let us forget about the left and the right and all the rest of it.  
Because there are very few people looking for jobs. 
However, what creates real jobs in this country? 
It is not more government programs. 
I hope the member would agree with that. 
What creates the real jobs in this country? 
That is the debate we should have. 
That is what we should be doing in this place.  
Because all the young people leave.  
No, it is because it has one of the hottest economies in Canada.  
By the way, it was the first province to have a balanced budget. 
These are realities that my friend forgot to mention.  
The member said that tax cuts create jobs. 
Regular folks got sick of being trickled upon. 
That is what happened. 
It was an economic disaster. 
Ronald Reagan bankrupted the United States. 
I will let the facts speak for themselves.  
My friend asks if government can play a role in job creation. 
I will give my friend an example.  
It is sponsored by the federal government. 
It is one of the few federal programs which I think really works well. 
Basically it provides support for individuals on employment insurance to create small businesses. 
These small businesses are thriving. 
Every loan has been paid back. 
That is something which the federal government has done and has done really well. 
That is something the federal government could do. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
We must deal with it as such.  
In many families that is simply not going to happen. 
Many students in many parts of the country are being discouraged from getting an education.  
We all know that job opportunities and education go together. 
The problem is horrendous and huge. 
There are 1.5 million students presently enrolled in Canadian post-secondary institutions. 
Those 1.5 million students now owe collectively $6.9 billion. 
This country cannot grow into the next century. 
We have more people leaving Saskatchewan, we have more people leaving Newfoundland. 
Where are they going to? 
They transferred them to the students. 
That is where the $6.9 billion of debt comes from.  
They have chosen not to get educated. 
I might as well not have gone at all.  
We all know there is a direct correlation between education and employment. 
Another terrible tragedy from this terrible debtload is bankruptcies. 
I know one of those agencies is based in the U.S. 
Unless you pay it all, it does not want anything from you. 
The out-migration is unbelievable.  
Where is the source of future economic growth in Canada? 
In the year 2006 of the new millennium who will buy cars and houses? 
Who will have the money? 
Where is the economic growth? 
That is not going to happen.  
Entrepreneurship and small business is such an important part of Canada's future growth. 
Small business creates most of our jobs. 
I met a young lady the other day with a masters in engineering. 
Guess what it will say? 
As the member for Kamloops said, it is all a matter of making choices. 
We can decide to freeze tuition. 
We can decide to lower student debt. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Many jobs have been lost because of technology.  
Today, with 800 employees, it can produce 10,000 tonnes daily.  
I am a very strong believer that free trade helped this country. 
That is very easy to prove.  
That is where the future is. 
In 1998 we have 1.5 million students who are heavily indebted. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with intent to the member. 
He talked about huge economic social problems of the future. 
Also, the motion addresses people fleeing from this country.  
That is the unilateral declaration of independence by the separatist party in Quebec. 
I take that one step further. 
How many people does he think will leave the country the day that revolution starts?  
It has caused the constitutional crisis of this country. 
It was wrong when the government sent it to the supreme court. 
It is still wrong. 
It will do nothing for the good of Canada. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Thirty seconds for the hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
That is why there are no jobs. 
It is his former government that is- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for St. John's West.  
In the case of students, debt has become significantly more difficult. 
It is simply not manageable.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Right now is the time for this to happen.  
Consequently this trend will ultimately damage our economy. 
Canada stands to lose domestic talent to our southern neighbour. 
The facts are clear. 
The tax rate for corporations ranges from 38% to 46% in Canada. 
Studies indicate that as of late we are losing young talent and ambition. 
Our leaders are the future. 
Student debt burdens are a serious problem in Canada. 
Unlike in the United States, disposable income has fallen in Canada. 
In fact, it has fallen or been flat for two years running. 
The unemployment rate in the United States has been considerably higher. 
The Liberal government has continued to cut, cut, cut. 
Now its eyes are finally opening, a little late I might add. 
These disheartening figures point to another issue that is surfacing. 
The fear of enormous debt is driving qualified students away from the universities. 
If this trend continues, what future does this country have?  
This is due to many reasons. 
The national income gap between Canada and the United States is getting worse. 
The salary gap is especially pronounced in occupations requiring high skills. 
Canadians pay about one-third more in taxes. 
It is estimated that there are 300,000 Canadians in California working in Silicone Valley.  
It is time this government admits to these mistakes. 
It must undo the damage it has done. 
The Liberal government must put a stop to this brain drain. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I was very interested in the remarks made by the hon. member for Markham. 
He is a strong advocate of tax relief as a policy for economic growth. 
I agree with what Mike Harris has done. 
That proves that high taxes cost jobs.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will start off by saying how quickly they forget. 
How quickly the hon. member for Sherbrooke forgets. 
In 1985 the government recorded a deficit of over $38 billion. 
By 1993 it got the deficit down to $41 billion. 
Over those nine years the total yearly deficits exceeded $290 billion. 
Just as damning, the interest payments on those deficits totalled $300 billion.  
I am not trying to shift the focus of today's debate. 
There is no mathematical mystery here. 
Deficits are like credit cards. 
The more the interest grows, the more the taxes grow.  
Let us look at the evidence on taxation. 
In 1985 the former government introduced the high income surtax. 
It was a temporary measure to help fight the deficit. 
Again it was a temporary measure to fight the deficit.  
We have done this without a single increase in personal income tax. 
There is another area where we have already taken some positive action. 
I do not want to magnify our actions. 
We know they are only the beginning of a solution for Canada's students. 
I can go on and on about the various initiatives the government has put forward. 
Let us remember one thing. 
I want to mention something I neglected to mention earlier. 
I will be splitting my time with the member for Kitchener Centre.  
I would say to the Tory caucus that Canadians disagree.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It somehow indicates that all the smarts have gone some place else. 
I would like to direct a question to the member who has just spoken. 
I would rather call it an intellectual exodus. 
We are talking about an exodus. 
That kind of taxation brings about an exodus. 
It is rock solid.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
A pox on both parties. 
The member can live in the past if he wants to. 
I am not patting myself on the back. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
It is true some American and Canadian employers are competing for talented Canadian youth. 
An example would be the software industry. 
Our commitments to Canada's youth are a living testimonial to a fundamental truth. 
Access to education is only one part of this equation. 
They never will be. 
But there can be no denying that this government is doing many things right.  
On that inspirational note I urge my hon. colleague to withdraw his unduly pessimistic motion. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I come from the province of Saskatchewan and I gave the examples. 
Simply pouring money into education in itself does not accomplish miracles.  
I hope the member will listen to the question carefully. 
There is a real problem. 
They go to these institutions and they end up not being properly prepared. 
What can we do about that?  
That is something this government has demonstrated. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Perhaps we should remind ourselves who is walking the walk. 
They are leaving Canada.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
We will continue down that road.  
Of course, it is taking time.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Late conversions are welcome ones nevertheless.  
It truly is remarkable. 
They should take up yoga. 
Such flexibility is required.  
It is an enormous waste. 
They need economic opportunity and it is not available to them today.  
That is the kind of country I want to live in. 
That is why I ran to be in this place.  
It is not simply an economic concept. 
I will speak of the experience of my family.  
Some of my family are fifth and sixth generation Canadian. 
Mine is a Canadian family which goes back 250 years. 
I am not happy about that fact.  
I would like to tell a personal story about my father. 
People earn far less there than they do in the public school system.  
Not as good as MPs' salaries.  
There is no MP pension. 
They are there because they are profoundly dedicated.  
That is the truth.  
Lo and behold, my father applied and was selected.  
There are no taxes.  
I am not suggesting that Canada ought to adopt the Arab economic model. 
He went to Canadian universities. 
We subsidized his education, for which he is grateful. 
They came here 150 years ago for economic reasons. 
They found opportunity in Canada and prospered in many different fields.  
There is no more a brain drain in Ireland. 
The greatest export in Ireland used to be its people. 
It is the model growing economy of Europe as a result.  
I am being heckled by the hon. member for Markham. 
A comment he made during his speech was interesting. 
They bask in the glory of the GST.  
That is not what Canadians want. 
Should it get bigger?'' 
The government wants to take the credit. 
That is what the $3 billion millennium fund is about.  
It is not about the future. 
I can see there is a lot of enthusiasm so we will move quickly.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the remarks of the member for Calgary Southeast.  
He was criticizing us for not cutting spending fast enough.  
Nevertheless, after four years we did get there. 
I am trying to squeeze people in, as we have been doing all day.  
We spend $103 billion in program spending. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
In her interview by the editorial board she talked about extra spending. 
She wanted all kinds of extra spending.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's question. 
That new spending ought to be found by reducing other programs.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, during the member's speech he gave some figures. 
I have a question for the member. 
It says there is no brain drain. 
In fact we have a net addition to the knowledge based manpower in Canada.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Our party believes as strongly as the Reform Party in the free market. 
The Liberals believe in free government, in big government. 
The Reform Party believes in free market. 
What is the hon. member's personal opinion on the bankruptcy issue? 
That is what happened to the Tory caucus in 1993. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Calgary Southeast for his riveting speech. 
They do not seem to understand.  
That is a difficult question, Mr. Speaker. 
It is rather interesting to listen to the debate. 
A colleague in the Conservative Party talked about the Liberals being big government. 
It does not say by how much. 
Would it be lower the tax burden of everybody? 
Are we talking one percentage point or ten? 
Is a particular level required before it is effective? 
They do not talk about that, of course.  
Offer interest relief to students is another comment that is made. 
How much interest relief? 
Is it a little bit? 
Are we talking total relief? 
Are we going to put it off for a while? 
No, of course they would not explain it.  
Do you know why they would not explain it, Mr. Speaker? 
I will tell you why. 
It is because they do not know what to do. 
They had nine years to do it, and what did they do? 
They do not know what they are talking about. 
They are offering a simplistic solution. 
That is why they are out of power.  
They do not know the difference. 
They have made no concrete proposals in terms of how you would address each one. 
Because they do not know the solutions. 
They have no creativity, no imagination.  
We had an unemployment level of 11.4% in Canada. 
They failed to acknowledge that. 
We do have the lowest unemployment levels in seven years. 
We have with other Canadians created over one million jobs. 
I hope it is not because they do not understand.  
That is not done in a simplistic manner, as has been suggested. 
We live in a society where continued learning is absolutely essential.  
The principal issue here is to understand the complexity of the problem. 
I have not heard that from members opposite. 
I am sorry but that is not the way it works. 
We have to broaden and deepen the talent pool in Canada.  
Do they have the same problems we have? 
On this particular front they do. 
Is that what they have to do as well? 
Do they have to adopt this ill-defined solution? 
This solution does not even attempt to define the problem.  
All this is essential. 
The government is already working with all those partners.  
I want to give some concrete examples. 
I heard a member of the Reform Party suggest that it is wasted money.  
We have not sufficiently invested in the granting councils in the past. 
We have established an infrastructure that encourages innovation. 
There is the Canadian Foundation for Innovation.  
We need to create an economic environment which fosters innovation. 
We have the IRAP program. 
We have research and development tax credits. 
We have an unemployment rate which is the lowest it has been in seven years. 
It is still too high, but it is coming down.  
It is so easy to turn up claiming one knows the answers. 
It is so easy to suggest something without defining it. 
It is so easy to criticize without offering any concrete and proven solutions.  
That is exactly what this is. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Let us further assume that fund will theoretically throw off a certain number of dollars. 
Let us also take into account our national debt is approaching $600 billion. 
This millennium fund is nothing but smoke and mirrors. 
It is just smoke and mirrors.  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
The Prime Minister has chosen to invest in young people. 
I want to be with the young people at the front of the line. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
It also takes consistency. 
Let us talk about consistency. 
Where did he stand at that time on those two issues?  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I just heard a comment which is absolutely incredulous. 
I believe that is what the member opposite said.  
Sure you can talk about the free trade that you brought in. 
You can talk about the GST, which was brought in by the Mulroney government. 
I would ask the members to look at a graph. 
It would go straight up and out of sight.  
With regard this motion, it is also rather incredulous. 
I would admit they have. 
In fact, revenue has increased in the province. 
There is no doubt about that. 
I am sure members could.  
He is a Liberal, he can understand your logic.  
And he is a good Liberal at that, I say to the member.  
That was the legacy of David Peterson.  
Bob Rae took over and we all recall why. 
I remember that day. 
He intentionally ran $10 billion deficits, overdrafts each and every year. 
Remember what I said, a deficit is an overdraft. 
Why have they not cut? 
Please help me with this. 
We have people lined up in emergency wards. 
We have replaced the level of transfer payments to the provinces. 
Why were they cut in the first place?  
Because the federal government cut them.  
I will admit to the member chirping why we cut them. 
I am sure the hon. member means Brian Mulroney and the hon. member for Sherbrooke. 
I am sure he would want to use that kind of nomenclature.  
He was a driving force in that government. 
Their decision would be whether to increase the deficit or not. 
So they are new to this place. 
They went from 160 down to 2. Some would call that a brain drain. 
I think I would call it a brain strain. 
What do they do now? 
That is what he and Mr. Eves said they would do. 
They have cut the taxes. 
How have they done it? 
He has terrific ideas. 
It has no credibility, none whatsoever on this issue.  
We will be strongly speaking and voting against this motion.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
I would like to talk about this millennium fund. 
The reality is that Canada owes almost $600 billion. 
Every dollar of the money we owe has to have some interest paid on it.  
We will have to pay interest on that $3 billion. 
I think the member would have to agree with that.  
I will use some numbers just so that we are talking about some hard numbers.  
You have to invest in our young people.  
I admit quite clearly that the debt must be attacked. 
Our finance minister has committed to that. 
They need our support and we need to invest in our youth. 
That is what the millennium fund will do. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
What does he see? 
Has he been to New Brunswick? 
Has he been to New Brunswick? 
They want to help us. 
What will they do for the maritimes?  
Madam Speaker, I stand corrected on the city the member was the mayor of. 
I know this member was not part of the Mulroney days. 
They will not admit the truth. 
They have no credibility whatsoever.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Could we not focus a bit on the future?  
The Progressive Conservative Party's motion today reads as follows: 
It covers so much. 
I am going to look at each element in turn.  
First, there is the brain drain. 
I did some research this morning. 
So we are somewhat ahead. 
The fact still remains, however, that there is a brain drain problem.  
One thing bothers me, however. 
That has to be paid for somehow.  
That concerns the first two elements. 
The third element is student loans. 
Here I am going to have some fun. 
We should have a quick look at the history of student debt. 
Every year tuition fees go up. 
We have to start at the beginning.  
It should be praised for noticing that the student debt load is very high. 
But we still need to see them put their money where their mouth is.  
That could be one solution. 
The tax credit for tuition fees could be another. 
It is really a shame to see this sort of petty politics. 
Another point mentioned was the tax burden. 
I am interested in the tax burden, as it covers quite a range of things. 
This is an up-to-date statistic, but it is also a persistent trend. 
We are looking at a steadily growing gap.  
That is a huge increase. 
If this keeps on, where are we headed? 
When I see``tax burden'', I think of taxes. 
But what are we doing about it? 
I do not see anything happening.  
I will name some of the companies. 
The money is there. 
It is in the pockets of the rich.  
This might well seem logical at first. 
It is in this sense that I find the Progressive Conservative Party's motion interesting. 
I am not talking about SMBs nor about businesses just starting up. 
I have to wonder about this, particularly when I see poverty on the increase.  
I heard what my colleague from New Brunswick had to say. 
In New Brunswick, poverty is steadily increasing. 
I think people will have to sit down and try to solve this serious problem. 
Where are things headed with measures like these? 
Where are things headed with one and a half million children living in poverty? 
I think that the taxation system needs to be revamped. 
I am not the first one to say so, either. 
The Liberals should be aware of the inequalities in the present federal system. 
They run up debts and that enriches the- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but his time is up.  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP) moved: 
I represent the riding of Vancouver East which has the lowest income community in Canada. 
My riding has been particularly hard hit by poverty and by unemployment.  
That was in 1989.  
In fact, the situation has worsened.  
We must ask ourselves what the root of the question is. 
When it comes to youth the situation is even worse. 
The official unemployment rate for youth is 16.5%. 
That does not include young people who have given up looking for work. 
Instead, we have seen a growing trend of inequality and poverty in Canada. 
This government has gutted our employment insurance system. 
Unfortunately that too is becoming more and more of a tragedy. 
While in opposition, the Liberals criticized the cuts as penalizing the poorest of the poor. 
Again, much of this is due to the cuts in federal funding.  
Mr. Martin and his so-called fiscal responsibility has been carried out- 
Mr. John O'Reilly:
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must remind the member to please adhere strictly to that rule.  
It has been rhetoric. 
Child poverty has been increasing.  
Anti-poverty groups in this country have been outspoken. 
And it does not apply to those on welfare.  
I believe that we must set national targets. 
We must embark on a national housing program. 
That is a program for people who are living in inadequate housing.  
I would urge the members of this House to take this motion seriously. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The Government of Canada cannot shoulder this responsibility on its own. 
Let me first address the issue of unemployment. 
These initiatives are showing concrete results.  
All members of this House are concerned about the high rate of youth unemployment. 
The hon. member's motion also calls for the elimination of poverty. 
The government is also addressing the horrendous problem of child poverty. 
We are determined to do everything possible to eliminate it.  
This is the basis for the national child benefit system.  
As part of the agenda the Speech from the Throne announced three new federal initiatives. 
What is needed are concerted efforts from all concerned, including members of this House. 
In that manner we will be serving all Canadians.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The intent of this motion is one I think with which this House agrees. 
It also provides that the government set targets for the elimination of unemployment.  
One is just some practical observations. 
The same holds true for the elimination of unemployment. 
That would be a more reasonable and a more realistic target.  
She would do well to remember that.  
I want to talk about the whole area of job creation and employment. 
It is a very interesting document. 
It recommends personal income tax rates should be increased. 
We do not need to do some of the things the NDP is consistently suggesting. 
We need new measures to bring real prosperity to the country.  
I recommend that to the member. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
This is what the red book says. 
It looks a lot like the criticism levelled at the present Liberal government. 
Should we applaud that? 
A number of representatives from different milieux are very critical of this government's approach. 
Quebec already has policies in these areas. 
You would do well to listen, sir. 
When you were in opposition- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I urge members of the House to consult this white paper. 
Two billion dollars must be invested now to help children. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
I must compliment the New Democratic Party for submitting this motion which reads: 
Individuals in this country are unemployed.  
Those are the greater issues for which we are here. 
It is a higher calling than actual political rhetoric.  
Children are poor because their parents are poor. 
They do not have a job. 
Canadians are poorer than they have been in a decade.  
What we believe is our economy needs a plan for growth. 
That is what is responsible for the surplus.  
We want to make sure the EI fund is sustainable. 
I know the hon. member for Compton-Stanstead understands that as well.  
The other thing it would do is stop taxing every new job that we create.  
For too long it has not been indexed to inflation. 
What happens is we take money away from the poor families that need the money.  
We have to challenge ourselves. 
The intent of this motion is to measure our success. 
The NDP should be applauded for bringing forth such a motion.  
That is the longest single stretch of high unemployment since the depression. 
Unfortunately it is not only an Atlantic Canadian phenomenon. 
They will be taxed less and they will have more opportunity.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House?  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Why will the child tax benefit not be fully indexed? 
If it was an anti-poverty measure, it would be.  
In my riding we had a round table on youth unemployment. 
One of the concerns was brought forward by young people themselves. 
I believe that these are things that can be done by the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 8.32 p.m.)
