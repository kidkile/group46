GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
CIVIL INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
This is a wonderful petition and I endorse it 100%.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am presenting two petitions this morning. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Peterborough.  
NATIONAL CHILD TAX BENEFIT 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions on a similar theme. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a large number of petitions to present. 
Over 30,000 petitioners are adding their names to the over 100,000 already presented.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Question No. 240- Mr. John Cummins: 
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
With respect, that is not a point of order.  
With respect, it is.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
With respect, it is not a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the House give its unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The issue is over and done with.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In addition, I would like to take note of a few of the recent headlines. 
We have recently seen many more of these headlines in Canada.  
Are Canadians overreacting or do they have justifiable concerns? 
The courts and the Liberal government are telling Canadians that they have it wrong.  
Many Canadians are concerned about this trend. 
There are two examples of recent court rulings. 
Concerned Canadians are watching this trend. 
Today we have an opportunity to put the people back into the process. 
Let us start the process today with this motion.  
Let me move to the second part of the motion, which states: 
The Reform Party has long advocated greater accountability to the public.  
In Corbett v Corbett the court said: 
Marriage provides a healthy biological design for procreation. 
Other types of relationships are technically incomplete.  
More is caught than taught.  
The same concept applies for daughters. 
Why wait until that happens? 
Why continue to let the courts lead? 
Would we use the notwithstanding clause to defend the current definition of marriage? 
Clearly the Liberals have a position that seems to say they will never use it. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
The member for Calgary Centre raised a number of issues. 
He talked about committed, loving, lifelong relationships. 
The hon. member has said that some day there will be a court challenge. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
In what we are doing here today we are not against anyone. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
If they believe in equality, where does that authority come from?  
She is assuming I said that married couples without children are technically incomplete. 
That was not at all what I said.  
That is a sad indictment of her party.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Marriage should be affirmed. 
It is legitimate for parliament to give guidance on important social policy matters. 
The courts often indicate that they are looking for guidance from parliament on different issues. 
The motion is an opportunity to clearly express the will of parliament. 
People should not be shut up. 
They are the ones we came here to represent. 
We should listen to these people when they send petitions to the House. 
They trust that the federal government supports that definition. 
Canada's demographics have changed significantly since Confederation. 
People immigrating to Canada now come mostly from Asia. 
I asked him if he would like to have his own children. 
He said he did not care, that having children was not important. 
He thanked me for making him realize that. 
One effect of the bill was to expand the benefits of the pension plan. 
The bill maintains that provision, which is good. 
It also extends the benefits beyond this point in a new way. 
I would like to move an amendment to the main motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On a point of order, the hon. member for Surrey Central.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to withdraw that amendment and change it. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Is that not correct?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The original amendment was before the House. 
The amendment had been presented by the member for Surrey Central in debate. 
We will do that right now. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
He then sat down having concluded his intervention in the debate.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Burnaby-Douglas has a point. 
I am going to consult with the clerk and we will sort this out.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Burnaby-Douglas is quite correct. 
We will now look at the first amendment.  
I do want to be quite clear. 
Can we have that clarified?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
No, that is not the case. 
This is being rectified. 
It is better to be rectified now than at 10 o'clock tonight.  
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what that amendment was. 
Could the Chair please confirm it for me?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I could return the first amendment to the hon. opposition House leader.  
For clarification, the Chair does not have an amendment at this time.  
Mr. Speaker, let me clarify this. 
My colleague from Surrey Central introduced an amendment. 
We do not have another amendment here.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will check the blues and we will take the time necessary to do so. 
The normal procedure is that that would be signed and presented to the Chair. 
It is not an amended motion. 
There has been no amendment presented to the Chair.  
Mr. Speaker, I signed one amendment. 
It has been presented to the hon. Chair.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Surrey Central says that he signed an amendment. 
Apparently the amendment he signed has been given to the Chair. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it may come out as a question but I certainly have a comment.  
I recognize that it is a value.  
It is not just for the term marriage.  
Mr. Speaker, there are many reasons that motivate prospective immigrants to Canada.  
What is a family? 
How do families begin? 
The definition of marriage is the one we are debating here. 
With due respect, this is the definition of marriage. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
He said that these families are somehow deficient.  
Mr. Speaker, what we are debating here is the definition of marriage. 
On this side of the House we are not against anyone or anything. 
That is the only issue we are debating today.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I heard the member speak about immigrants coming to Canada. 
I am here to represent my constituents. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
As stated in the motion, the definition of marriage is already clear in law. 
The courts have upheld the constitutionality of that definition.  
In that decision a majority of the court stated the following: 
I do not think the Charter has that effect. 
No jurisdiction worldwide defines a legal marriage as existing between same sex partners. 
The majority of young people still expect to marry. 
At this time I would like to move an amendment to the motion. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment is in order and is accepted. 
The debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Minister of Justice for supporting the motion. 
I also agree with her comment about marriage being an important institution.  
I went to sleep last night thinking about the motion. 
Sometimes things create a life of their own. 
The Minister of Justice and I both recognize that happens all the time.  
It is also found in the civil law of the country. 
If it is believed that some clarity is required around that, so be it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
However, this time I can.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I quote from Professor Hogg: 
The federal government has jurisdiction over marriage and divorce. 
The provinces have jurisdiction over solemnisation.  
That is why I moved the amendment. 
We are not arrogating to ourselves any jurisdiction that we do not have. 
Obviously we could not do that.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I am a bit bothered by the turn the debate is taking. 
I have the feeling Reform Party members want to oppose two concepts. 
It would appear that they want to steer the debate in another direction.  
Members will be able to vote according to their conscience. 
This is very important, given the underlying implications.  
I can understand that such a ruling would upset some Reformers.  
They did not invent the wheel. 
I think things have changed. 
In Quebec, I would say we are in the lead. 
As we can see, things are changing. 
We are mulling this question over. 
I think it is too early.  
They wonder where their demands will end. 
This is a legitimate question.  
There is marriage, there is union, there is the couple. 
The dictionary definition of marriage has changed. 
This means that the definition is an evolving one. 
That leads me to another point I want to address. 
Here too, things have evolved. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It has to do with the word discrimination.  
We certainly have seen that in court decisions.  
In the dictionary the definition of discrimination includes a mixture. 
But this is really a very personal response.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a very direct question for my Bloc colleague.  
I think the member can understand what that means.  
Does the member properly represent the voters in his riding?  
I will not answer this question, but I leave a great big question mark.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I think it is an important amendment.  
We use that word marriage. 
It is the most private commitment one can make. 
When a carpenter joins together certain pieces, they are married. 
We marry up certain things.  
Fifty years ago she put on a wedding ring. 
She made a commitment. 
Marriage takes all kinds of forms. 
I am married to England''.  
Marriage has many connotations. 
We have to bear that in mind because we are dealing with words. 
Words in this chamber are important. 
Some of them are important. 
We have had definitions of marriage and what it means.  
We need clarification on that. 
I do not know what that means. 
Do we go further than that? 
We need some clarity on that.  
The scope of federal power has been left largely undetermined.  
I put that question to the minister and she agreed with me. 
It is the province that sanctions the marriage. 
It is the federal government that sanctions divorce.  
I understand we are here until 6.30.  
We also have to go behind the motion. 
This has been commented on by the mover and seconder of the motion. 
It will be noted that in my opening remarks I did not refer to that. 
I think it should go further. 
In light of that, it is a complex motion. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party has articulated a tolerant message on the situation. 
Overarching the motion which we are putting forth today is one of tolerance. 
I want to make that clear. 
I have represented many people who have been through difficult divorce situations. 
Registered domestic partnerships are a good thing. 
I thank the member for the question. 
I think it is an important question. 
I would have no objection to it.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I want the member's reaction to that.  
There is a commercial on credit cards which says that membership has its privileges. 
The fundamental question is this. 
Mr. Speaker, the first part of the question concerned equality. 
I know many homosexuals who support heterosexual marriages. 
I support heterosexual marriages, as I am in one. 
I know he did not mean it in that context. 
I think that requires some clarification.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I have to take some umbrage with that. 
The motion restates the current state of the law, both common and civil. 
That is not to undermine the importance of the issue. 
I personally do not prescribe to that thought. 
I believe that it runs much deeper and is far more complicated. 
I believe that to be very true.  
This motion does not call for specifics. 
It does not call for an amendment to current legislation, particularly the Criminal Code. 
It does not speak of charter amendments. 
It does not speak of highlighting one particular right over another. 
Some day there may be a challenge to the constitutional definition of marriage. 
This day has a greater priority. 
We have an opportunity to bring grievances to the Government of Canada. 
This is an ancient right that we can exercise in this place. 
There is strife within the caucus of the government.  
We have a very limited opportunity to interact at the committee level. 
I believe that we should be having consultations. 
There are two very separate and distinct issues. 
I do not believe the suggestion that one leads necessarily to the other. 
The courts themselves have given very clear rulings. 
That is not going to be accomplished.  
I believe that it is going to remain a very strong and important institution. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
The member suggests that we have ulterior motives, that this is a divisive issue. 
Yet on the other hand he said that this is a motion of importance.  
The member cannot have it both ways. 
He is talking about jobs and health care. 
Those are issues which we talk about every day. 
No one is suggesting that they are not important issues.  
The member has to decide which way it is. 
The member said that this motion will not fortify the institution of marriage. 
We are both members of the bar. 
Which way is it? 
They will change the current law in most instances.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I happen to agree with him. 
I have my own personal feelings about the terms of marriage. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her comments. 
That is not productive.  
It is never difficult to find issues that inflame passions. 
That is what we should be striving to do.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise on this very important issue. 
After listening to the last few speakers, I want to read something: 
I do not know how much clearer we can get than that. 
We talk about hot button politics. 
I lay awake last night for a long time thinking about this issue. 
I have been in the courts as a member of the bar. 
Judges are always shaping the law of the land. 
The law of the land has been by no means static. 
Quite often lawyers presenting cases will refer to Hansard . 
Of course the country was immediately outraged.  
Parliament is the supreme lawmaker of Canada. 
It is painfully simple. 
It cannot be confused with any other issues.  
I have seen members table petitions that are inches high.  
How much plainer and simpler can we get than this definition? 
There are no other issues. 
There is no hidden agenda, absolutely nothing.  
Your nose is growing.  
It is ridiculous to even suggest that.  
There is one agenda. 
I say that sincerely, with all my heart. 
That is it and nothing else.  
They are looking for that. 
The courts say this is an issue on which parliament should rule.  
This is what the debate is about and nothing else. 
Hopefully members have got it now. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member is quite right. 
The member will also well know of the supreme court decisions. 
My question for the member has to do with the concept of discrimination. 
Mr. Speaker, I know the Minister of Justice introduced an amendment. 
That goes without saying. 
That is why it was not in our original motion. 
That is an automatic and a given. 
It did not need to be stated.  
With regard to the hon. member's comments on discrimination, there is no discrimination. 
We are only reaffirming the definition of marriage. 
I have no problem with that. 
That is not the issue. 
It is not an issue about sexuality. 
This is an issue strictly about the definition of marriage. 
I personally do not discriminate against any of those people. 
I am quite happy to state that on the record.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very obvious. 
There are five official parties in the House. 
Members of every single have presented petitions on this issue. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to address this issue today. 
Every day Canadians contact their members of parliament about this issue.  
Millions of Canadians currently live in the institution of marriage. 
This is not something that is foreign to people. 
This is something that is part of everyday life. 
That is exactly what we are taking the opportunity to do today.  
I commend my colleague from Calgary Centre for really pushing this issue. 
I think it is extraordinarily important. 
We need to affirm it. 
That is what we are doing today.  
This is an important issue. 
It should be dealt with in the Parliament of Canada.  
I reject what the Minister of Justice was saying. 
I simply want to point out that the courts are very unpredictable. 
That is alarming to me and to many other Canadians.  
That concerns them and it concerns me as somebody who represents those people. 
That is why we are speaking out on this issue today.  
How many times have we debated things in this place that have been absolutely inane? 
I would argue many times. 
I remember the lead-up to the referendum in 1995. 
That was worthy of debate in this place for some reason.  
Some people will feel badly about that''. 
I say that is too bad. 
We are elected to do that job. 
We are paid well to do it. 
That is what we are saying today.  
I want to address some of the comments that came from members of the NDP. 
I have news for the member for Vancouver East. 
It is not discrimination. 
It is simply a definition that tells us what constitutes a marriage.  
Gay couples can have their own relationships. 
They can call them what they will. 
There are other relationships. 
Friendships are called friendships. 
They are not the same thing. 
That does not mean it is discrimination. 
That is all it means. 
It has nothing to do with discrimination. 
I reject that as another red herring. 
What did the member for Burnaby-Douglas say? 
He said that was an appalling attack. 
He somehow suggested this was discrimination. 
It is a fact. 
It is pretty clear. 
It is by definition the case. 
I applaud him for his remarks. 
That role is to determine who has the capacity to marry. 
That is determined by the federal government. 
We have to weigh in on this. 
The courts have often asked that parliament send a clear message. 
That is precisely what we are proposing to do today. 
That is what I say to my friend from Sydney-Victoria.  
I would argue that he did a very important thing when he did that. 
I encourage my friends across the way to vote in favour of the motion.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
We have to keep reminding the courts of the principles which the supreme parliament holds.  
It is often said in some advertising that membership has its privileges and its rights. 
This is the dilemma that the House has to deal with. 
I want the member's comments.  
Ultimately, the courts cannot establish the mores of the country. 
That has to come from the people. 
Those decisions should be made here in a free and open debate.  
My friend mentioned that the government will support the motion. 
I would expect that individual MPs will make these decisions for themselves. 
That is typically what happens in a free parliament.  
I hope that is not the case.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
The member spoke about the affirmation of marriage and I really agree with that.  
The phones in my constituency are ringing again today supporting this resolution and- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That seems like a good spot to interrupt. 
The member for Medicine Hat has 30 seconds to respond.  
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from the Peace River country. 
I know he is a real champion on these sorts of issues.  
I encourage members on all sides to do exactly that today.  
That condition is inherent in the very institution of marriage.  
This rule can be found in article 365 of the Civil Code of Quebec. 
This is also reflective of the state of the law in all other Canadian jurisdictions. 
I would like to respond to comments made by opposition members. 
That is really the question today.  
It constantly tries to make and score political points by confusing the issue.  
There is no issue here. 
I will be sharing my time with the member for Mississauga South.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
It's cheap politics.  
The fact is that Canadian people are concerned. 
Mr. Speaker, I am also a member of parliament and I also receive phone calls. 
A lot of time those phone calls are made because Canadians are misinformed. 
They lead to confusion.  
Yes, people want to know where the government stands. 
I am not debating the fact that we should not have a definition of marriage. 
As the minister said, there is a definition of marriage.  
The rule of law.  
That is what the government has shown. 
That has not been the intent of Her Majesty's Official Opposition.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's position. 
I do not agree with it, but I appreciate it.  
Those were the words of the judge. 
The courts are looking to the House to give direction on these issues.  
We do not know. 
I will repeat what the minister said this morning. 
There was never any intention by the government to redefine marriage.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
I wonder if the hon. member would disagree or agree with that.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
In fact it is a very important motion. 
It comes down to some fundamentals.  
The line in the sand, apparently, for many has to do with marriage. 
That is the line in the sand.  
Policy by its very nature is discriminatory. 
It has to be discriminatory. 
Policy by its very definition, by its very nature, is discriminatory.  
To say that is to raise the issue of the context of discrimination. 
Earlier I spoke about the definition of discrimination. 
There are other applications. 
I will highlight a couple of examples. 
We get it because we are 65. 
It is age discrimination. 
It is discrimination in favour of seniors.  
Why is someone not here saying that we all have to be equal? 
Should we not all be equal?  
What about disability benefits? 
There is discrimination in favour of those who are disabled.  
There are a number of provisions for things such as investment income. 
A couple can pool their income. 
These are all discriminatory in favour of a particular group.  
It is discrimination, but it is discrimination in favour of something.  
On that point I look back at history. 
It was a social benefit. 
It was not an employment expense. 
There is a debate on that as well.  
There is an age for the non-refundable tax credit. 
When a person is 65 they receive it. 
I could go on and on. 
That is simply from the Income Tax Act. 
We should not talk about discrimination solely in the context of a negative. 
How do we value things?  
The equality they are seeking is equality of individuals. 
They want individuals to be the lowest common denominator.  
Should we not treat everyone the same? 
Should we not reduce ourselves to the lowest common denominator? 
Should we not just be a vanilla society? 
Should we not just say that relationships do not exist in our laws? 
Why do we not just say that we are all individuals? 
There is a synergy in a society. 
There are certain things that happen.  
He talked about the family. 
That is the family.  
The Cardinal referred to the family. 
He quoted Pope John Paul II: 
There is a special role. 
We discriminate to reflect values. 
If we did not do that then it would be a vanilla society. 
The issue here also has to do with the courts. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have to comment on the lowest common denominator. 
The relationships among those families have not been perfect. 
Changes have to be made. 
It is not just the term marriage. 
That should not be the case.  
Mr. Speaker, I believe the member misheard me. 
I bring that to the attention of the member. 
There is a debate pointer.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
They do not form government policy. 
They are there on an advisory or on a discussion basis. 
They are not binding on the party, and the member will know that.  
We have to talk about being for things and not against things.  
I support them and I discriminate in favour of the family.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
His narrow definition is one I do not accept.  
I did not define the family exclusively and that is it.  
That is not speculation. 
That is not some wild idea. 
That is a fact.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Personally speaking, I just celebrated my 24th wedding anniversary. 
Since then it has been pretty good. 
What we are debating today is: 
It does not say that it is against anything. 
Again we are affirming that today.  
Someone earlier asked about the definition of family. 
Is a single mom with some kids a family? 
What if she adopted a couple of kids? 
What about a single father? 
Those are families, and we recognize that. 
That is another great debate. 
That is what this is about.  
Why should we bother with this debate? 
The next point is allowing Canadians to be heard on the subject. 
He may want to remove it. 
More power to him, if he can convince somebody. 
We should not be afraid of any of that.  
He married the lady of his dreams just before he went there. 
They had a ceremony. 
There was a marriage certificate. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the member's excellent speech. 
I have been married for 29 years. 
More than that, to me as a Roman Catholic, marriage is a holy sacrament.  
How would he look at it?  
Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question.  
What the member is talking about of course is a church wedding, a church marriage. 
They enter into it in the traditional faith perspective of the two shall become one. 
Most people enter into it in a very serious and solemn way. 
There is nothing more stressful than a separation in a marriage.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It was really difficult for me to capture your eye but I had to interrupt.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Then the soldier went away and had the terrible accident with the mine. 
Mr. Speaker, the member did get the point of my original story. 
They do not have to prove they are sleeping together. 
They do not have to prove it is a long term commitment. 
They do not have to have children. 
The member put forward a hypothetical case. 
I encourage the member and his party to bring it forward. 
For the marriage definition, those two people are a man and a woman.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Why are we debating such a topic? 
Why are we spending time discussing something that would seem to be so self-evident? 
There has been a chronology of events over the last number of months.  
Let me quote the justice minister on this point. 
In an April 24, 1998 letter she stated: 
They are different issues that belong in different categories.  
The institution of marriage has brought great benefits to our society. 
That is a documented fact. 
Why does a marriage bring these benefits, we ask. 
My point here is simply that people are serious when they get married. 
That is of great benefit to all of society.  
It would be foolish to undermine the uniqueness of the marriage relationship. 
It is much more than a form of self-expression. 
The institution of marriage is not something to be toyed with. 
We would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. 
To tinker with the institution of marriage would send the wrong message. 
First, it would send the wrong message to our young people. 
This optimism is good. 
It needs to be encouraged.  
It is one man and one woman for life. 
Opposite sex, is defined as well.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Quite frankly, I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that I support this 100%. 
There are other ways to define who might be the recipient of a survivor benefit. 
It in no way demeans other kinds of relationships. 
What we are talking about here is the legal definition of marriage.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Many Canadians of the Muslim faith are allowed to marry more than one woman. 
That is the rule.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
However, I do think other issues have been brought into this as well.  
The member raised a very valid question. 
The hon. member must address this issue before we vote on the subject. 
It is a very important issue.  
I am not exactly sure of his intent. 
It has been long held in our Judeo-Christian setting.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington.  
The court shouldn't be deciding it. 
Courts, by definition, do not have a broad perspective. 
Necessarily, the courts' focuses are narrow and specific.  
The process is fairly open and democratic. 
No judicial inquiry can ever match the breadth of a parliamentary process.  
Having said that, the second step of the process is much more problematic. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
How can he justify that?  
We want to be much tighter in our use of language. 
We want particular words to mean particular things to particular pieces of legislation.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
We would like to stop sliding down the slippery slope.  
The case had turned into an abstract argument over gay marriage. 
The monetary aspect had been closed. 
That is why this whole discussion today is so important.  
I would like to know if the member has any response to my comments.  
Section 1 concerns the definition of marriage. 
The next step is to de-conjugalize the issue. 
If we do that we have taken the steam right out of the debate.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
First, let me say that I am a member of parliament. 
I am not bound by any policy decisions made by a Liberal convention. 
The Reform Party may be bound by the suggestions from policy conventions but not me. 
I have no difficulty saying that I support this motion. 
We owe those Canadians an obligation to respect their feelings on this issue. 
I voted against my government several years back on this very issue. 
The government used the word conjugal based on its use in previous court decisions. 
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very special day in the House. 
There are other ways of supporting families too. 
I am very appreciative of my family. 
Let us get debt and taxes down.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Clean freshwater and farmland are becoming more scarce. 
Fish are declining in the world's rivers, lakes and oceans. 
Our ecosystem and our health bear the brunt of these impacts.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
The medical community has made tremendous progress in understanding leukemia. 
I am sure we will see a cure to leukemia very soon.  
RELAY FOR A FRIEND 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
What the organizers and the participants achieved in this event was truly amazing. 
Many of those involved have survived cancer. 
Congratulations to everyone involved.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Canadian farmers are getting political rhetoric.  
Is the government listening? 
They need solutions, not empty promises.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
The 1984 attack resulted in the deaths of many innocent men, women and children.  
Religious freedom, which is protected here in Canada, was violated. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The election really was a horse race and what a finish it was. 
Hurray for New Brunswickers who demonstrated their political muscle yesterday. 
They considered carefully the policies, the parties, the leaders and the candidates. 
It is about hope and energy going in new directions. 
And it is on its way to Ottawa. 
It is going to thunder through those front benches and halls of power. 
All I can say is, heads up, your time is coming too.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
George Harris has taken the matter to court. 
I think George Harris is a hero for defending our interests. 
The hon. member for Drummond.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, cracks are already beginning to appear in Lucien Bouchard's government. 
Mr. Bouchard is beginning not to like what he sees in Quebec. 
What in fact seems to be threatened is the PQ model. 
There is a difference.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, what a great day it is for New Brunswick.  
This election gave democracy back to the people. 
PARKDALE COMMUNITY CLEANUP DAY 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Taxpayers did not only fund absurd movies. 
SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition asks a very good question. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, 800 Canadian forces personnel are on their way to the former Yugoslavia. 
Mr. Speaker, we can tell the Canadian people, as we agreed some weeks ago. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It will not go away.  
Where is the receipt?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
She is in charge of managing it. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It is as clear as mud.  
This Liberal arrogance, this going to see me through attitude, is just not working. 
Just ask Camille Theriault and Dalton McGuinty how well that works.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I said, and I repeat, I sold those shares. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I ask him quite simply why he does not table the bill of sale. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will repeat the same thing over again. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
So, the decision is his. 
It would be so easy to remove all suspicion. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I leave its management to the person in charge of it.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That will settle it.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I repeat: all of my assets are managed by a trustee. 
I have no oversight over the management.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
If so, he should let us know.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He has looked at the portfolio my trustee is handling for me. 
I have no right of supervision whatsoever over that trust.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Why is the government content to push through yet another Senate budget without public scrutiny?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is there until it is changed in the constitution. 
We wanted to change it some years ago. 
So we have the Senate that has been given to us by the Reform Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, a lot of Canadians beg to differ. 
The Canadian Senate has no place in a modern democracy. 
It is a joke and an embarrassment. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They did it for months and months to no avail. 
When we had a chance we voted for reform of the Senate. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
There is a big difference between demilitarizing and disarming. 
Canadian troops will be among the first to enter Kosovo.  
What are the Canadian army's rules of engagement? 
I would like the Prime Minister to accurately inform us on this important issue. 
I hope he will be able to answer clearly this time.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the resolution was clear.  
That is the text that has been agreed to by everybody. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Berserk is looking kind of good right now. 
If they were sold, where is the receipt?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I think what Mr. Wilson said to the committee is very clear.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Perhaps I can put the question another way:
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will quote Mr. Wilson.  
It is very clear. 
I have confidence in him.  
My trust fund has to administer my assets. 
It is a blind trust and blind means blind. 
I am just doing what is required. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
He says it is in the hands of the trust.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the trustee is the one in charge of these things. 
Under the circumstances, ministers, like the Prime Minister, have no right of supervision. 
It is a matter of having a blind trust manage one's assets. 
This is done for all ministers, as it is for me.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It makes no sense.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
He said that he knows about it and that he is studying it. 
My sources say that no such study is taking place in these prisons.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I have known about it for six years.  
This does not sound like a plan, it sounds like a cop-out to me.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I thought he found out last week.  
We must do a review.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as far as interests are concerned, I sold them.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
But nobody has seen hide nor hair of a deed of sale.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, indeed there is a drug problem in the prisons. 
Let us take a look at what happened last Saturday in the Kingston Penitentiary.  
This is the last event that has taken place. 
There have been many events that have taken place over a number of years. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, is that not really something? 
He has just started his study. 
Why does he have no plan? 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
As I have indicated, even 12% is too much. 
We intend to address the problem.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Can he explain all these about-faces to us? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He said clearly that the shares had never been returned.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
When he came out he was addicted to heroin. 
Where is the solicitor general's plan? 
Who is doing it? 
When are we going to get some results?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
The problem has been there for years.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is not enough. 
We will do more.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am looking forward to reading the report of the subcommittee. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
As usual, he promised to study the problem. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We have also been told that the statement of requirement has been done for months.  
Where is the statement of requirement for the Sea King replacements? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
They never got a straight one. 
Where is the statement of requirement for the Sea King replacement? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I made it quite clear that we want to replace them. 
We are waiting on the statement of requirement. 
If we could get it out today or tomorrow, I would love to do that. 
I would love to do that here and now. 
We are going to get it out just as quickly as we possibly can.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I would rather we de-personalize the questions, if it is at all possible.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member has got his facts wrong. 
By and large the system has worked well. 
The people who were selected are of the highest calibre. 
Their names were put forward in consultation with the users. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is the sequence of events provided in the agreement.  
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
He has said many times ``disarm''. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, demilitarization and disarmament are not incompatible. 
We will need both of those things to happen. 
Disarmament of the KLA will happen in the initial stages. 
NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH STRATEGY 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I intend to act on most of those recommendations shortly.  
Throughout the coming months we will be consulting directly with Canadians on their priorities. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The new Canada Marine Act was supposed to depoliticize port governance in this country. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We have put people in place who have reflected user concerns. 
QUEBEC'S POLITICAL FUTURE 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
It is against democracy and against the law in this country.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
The building has been vacant and empty for 10 years. 
No other government agency wants it.  
It would make a very appropriate millennium project to turn it over to the town. 
Will the minister approve that transfer?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to look into this matter further.  
I would like to go directly to him.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this situation.  
To get directly to the point, I did give an interview to the Toronto Star . 
In my opinion all I did was reflect my personal opinion. 
I made that clear with the reporter when I spoke to him. 
That is my understanding. 
Mr. Speaker, that is correct. 
They were public meetings.  
It was not even concurred in. 
That has not happened.  
It seems to me this will not go away. 
I think the onus is on the Chair to make some decision. 
We are awaiting its report. 
It has not been concurred in.  
It is up to the House to decide how it will conduct itself. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
I have brought numerous problems to your attention. 
It is ridiculous beyond belief.  
At a certain point, people should stop taking us for idiots.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
I assume that is 1998. 
However, I will hear some advice.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, citation 495(3) of Beauchesne's states: 
I think this is clear. 
I did not hear the hon. solicitor general quote directly from it. 
We will begin with the leader of the Reform Party.  
THE LATE HUGH HANRAHAN 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hugh served in this place from 1993 to 1997. 
He grew up in Antigonish, Nova Scotia in a family of five boys. 
Perhaps that comes from being a father of five children. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
He did all that he could to ensure that it was nourished and fostered.  
His bid at federal politics was successful.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
This was perfectly natural, since teaching was a real passion for Hugh. 
He won his election in 1993 in the riding of Edmonton-Strathcona. 
That shows just how much he cared for and respected his students.  
The loss of someone dear is always very difficult to accept. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Hanrahan was a teacher for 18 years in the Catholic school system in Edmonton. 
He taught social studies, economics and psychology. 
He often visited Nova Scotia and would talk about his visits there.  
I shared his very serious thoughts in that regard.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
His attachment to his Scottish and Irish ancestries was worn with pride. 
He has now returned to the welcoming arms of his beloved Nova Scotia. 
The country is richer because he did so. 
He served the public in a noble and dignified way. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member is seeking unanimous consent to present a petition. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It is something that nature or God gives us. 
It is a flaw, perhaps, or an abnormality. 
Second, we should legislate a definition of spouse.  
Then what we should do is create a new definition and call it dependent partner. 
Once we do that then the rest should fall in place. 
I believe that is so. 
I think this is an easy solution. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
People who live together may define themselves as or may self-identify as spouses. 
They may be in a common law relationship as man and woman. 
They may be of the same sex.  
Yet the very motion and debate that is taking place would do exactly that. 
For what reason do we need to do that? 
Who is this threatening? 
What will be next? 
Will we define the family?  
Madam Speaker, we have just heard an example of the rhetoric of intolerance. 
It is the proper place of this place to define things in law. 
That is our job. 
That is what we are here to do. 
It is my right. 
I was elected by my constituents to do exactly that.  
I cannot do that. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I commend the member for Wentworth-Burlington on his eloquent remarks.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I think of marriage and family in a very special way. 
That was probably true. 
We have a very solid family relationship based on marriage. 
To me it goes somewhat beyond the verbal definition.  
We are talking about language. 
We all know that over time language changes. 
Even in my own lifetime I have seen some changes in the language.  
We had a motto in grade eight. 
I still remember it well. 
The reward for doing good work was to have enjoyment for it afterward. 
In my generation the word simply meant carefree, happy and without worry. 
I still remember most of them. 
I am here today to share this aspect of a definition of marriage. 
I remember my grandparents. 
They passed away a number of years ago. 
Lord willing, they will be celebrating their 65th next year in the millennium year. 
That is their millennium project. 
They are still very healthy and we are very grateful for that. 
As I have said, my wife and I share that same meaning.  
That is the current definition. 
I believe that they have no intention of changing it.  
Why do we bring this motion? 
It is very simple. 
Think of the word ``spouse''. 
The courts are starting to change the word ``spouse''. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
His examples were very pertinent. 
I have a question for him:
Madam Speaker, we are really not talking about other kinds of relationships today. 
There is no doubt that they exist. 
I do not like the word in that context, but there it is. 
I do not really think that we are talking about the other one. 
That may occur and that is a subject for another day.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
However, all of the courts are saying to us that they want our guidance. 
They have said ``unless the court speaks''. 
We have some instances where the courts have actually asked for this. 
I have several examples here. 
They are changing the definition of spouse. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Of course a spouse is a part of a marriage. 
It also said ``this appeal does not challenge traditional conceptions of marriage''.  
There have been moves in other parts of the world to re-examine this issue. 
In 1996 the American Congress passed what is called the defence of marriage act. 
That act did two things. 
I would like to read the wording of the petitions that have been filed. 
Eighty-four members of parliament have stood up to present this petition: 
There was one dissenting judge even on that exception. 
When there is commentary like that, our citizens are concerned. 
They wonder what is going to happen.  
If there is doubt, let us clear it up. 
There are a number of reasons the institution of marriage is important. 
In the book It Takes Two:
The Family in Law and Finance by Allen and Richards it is stated: 
Marriage is an efficient institution. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
I thank the members who have participated.  
Madam Speaker, I agree with the member. 
The intent of the motion is not to be partisan. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this issue.  
Usually they would fit into that category. 
I will be splitting my time with the member for Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia.  
I want to add that the information is clear. 
There are no plans to legislate a change in the definition of the term marriage.  
Let us go back to where that comes from. 
The galleries were filled with people who were extremely upset. 
How did you vote?  
I voted against it. 
We also, in my view, should not gain rights in that regard. 
It should not be a defining principle.  
We would be unable to determine the level of premium we should set. 
I understand that there are some problems.  
This is ultimately what the debate is all about.  
It is not constructive contribution to the debate and it is certainly premature.  
What does that tell us? 
Let us call it for what it is. 
I do not think so. 
We should not discriminate against them based on their sexuality. 
As far as I am concerned, it cuts both ways.  
I support the family. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, my colleague has touched on many of the concerns.  
I have a very brief question for him. 
I wonder if the hon. member would like to comment on that.  
That is why we did Bill C-78. 
I voted for Bill C-78 and would again.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
He knew how to skate right away from that question. 
I am not going to let him get away with it.  
Can he comment on that?  
They are not based on sexuality but on hard dollars and cents.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to try this question one more time.  
The member in his speech clearly said he was against that. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Ultimately we are talking about minority rights. 
I do not have any trouble supporting the institution of marriage. 
I consider it an essential part of the bedrock of society. 
I have some experience inside the institution of marriage. 
I was first married more than 39 years ago. 
I have what I think is the perfect wife and perfect mate. 
Marriage is extremely important. 
We as parliamentarians have a duty to nurture and to support the institution of marriage. 
Maybe the Reform Party is. 
Are the courts in the country demanding that parliamentarians change the definition of marriage? 
I do not see that. 
I do not see that at all.  
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
It reminds me of the Reform Party on the issue of a carbon tax. 
As far as I know it is not the Liberal Party. 
I do not know anybody in the Liberal Party who wants a carbon tax. 
Nobody except the Reform Party talks about a carbon tax. 
It is called fearmongering. 
It is the same on this issue.  
Those discriminatory practices are being stopped.  
They form a huge majority. 
A party like that will never govern the country. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I have not heard anything of that nature. 
The motion today is very simple. 
I will read it into the record. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to respond to those unfounded charges. 
All of us in the House support marriage. 
We support the current definition of marriage. 
That is not a problem.  
It is simply talking about equal treatment when it comes to the provision of benefits. 
That is all the resolution is talking about. 
It is as simple as that.  
Madam Speaker, we are finally getting to the bottom of it with this hon. member. 
He says the courts have already changed the definition. 
I will read from the resolution: 
No such thing exists. 
It is the same thing with the Liberal Party motion. 
It does not demand a change in the definition of marriage.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
I will begin by reading the motion we are debating in the House today. 
The Reform Party motion put forward for debate today reads as follows: 
Of course, that motion was defeated by the Liberals, unfortunately.  
That also was unsuccessful.  
Let us now turn to the NDP. 
Alexa McDonough and Canada's NDP''. 
In fact, that is exactly what they are doing in the House today. 
Again I will read directly from the official Liberal Party policy: 
That is where the NDPs and the Liberals are coming from.  
The section on equality states: 
Under the heading of family it states: 
Recent headlines in some national newspapers serve to illustrate my point. 
A headline in the Ottawa Citizen read ``Same-sex partners declared spouses:
A headline in the London Free Press was entitled ``Redefining our Partnerships:
The Reform motion instructs the court that the legal definition of marriage shall remain unchanged.  
Madam Speaker, the hon. member made reference to the Liberal Party convention. 
The member talked about the Reform Party convention and the definition of equality. 
The way the Reform Party works is that every two years we have an assembly. 
The majority will of the party membership determines what those policies are. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
It seems the members of the Reform Party who spoke earlier must be blind. 
We are sitting here supporting this issue. 
Never in M. v H. was there any reference to marriage.  
I have listened with greatest to the debate throughout the day. 
They are going to see tonight. 
I think they are using the wrong approach. 
It is fearmongering, which the member referred to earlier.  
Madam Speaker, I would correct the hon. member on one thing. 
He stated ``We believe in the traditional family''. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
That is our motion.  
I want to do three things. 
The issue is rather significant. 
Is it simply for partisan advantage? 
Is it strictly crass politics and things of that sort? 
It is nothing of the kind.  
We influence each other here in the House.  
Through the reassertion of the definition we want to influence the judges of the land. 
Why is it that we need to have these definitions? 
It has spiritual connotations. 
I admit that I am a married man. 
It has been a wonderful time. 
I want to go back in history as to how important definitions really are. 
It comes to me from the field of science. 
In science we have a very significant suggestion.  
That is what we are talking about here today. 
That seems to be lost in this debate somewhere. 
That is what this is all about.  
What is the choice that we have here today? 
That is the clear choice we have today. 
Why is it so important that parliament make that choice and that decision? 
The affirmations also apply to the legislature. 
Why is it so important that we make a choice? 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
We are coming to the end of the debate. 
I have been fortunate. 
I was married in 1967 and I am still married to the same person. 
It is what we are talking about today. 
It is the basis for strong families.  
Mr. Speaker, to me the family is the fundamental unit in society. 
When parents have a debate or an argument the children can see that. 
They can recognize it. 
They see that ways can be found to resolve that.  
What does marriage have to do with the family? 
Are there other definitions of family that can be brought into play? 
But marriage is absolutely central at the first instance. 
That is my belief.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to go to another part of the member's presentation.  
I thank the hon. member for that question.  
It is fundamental and it is setting the direction. 
I am proud to be able to do that.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
I am very happy and pleased to be able to rise tonight on this debate. 
This definition has been appropriate and has served us well in the past. 
It is appropriate and serves us well now. 
It will continue to be appropriate and serve us well in the future. 
There are no exceptions, no qualifications and no limitations. 
The statement is clear and concise. 
It is the union of two persons of the opposite sex.  
This case has been consistently applied in Canada. 
Yes, Mr. Speaker, by the courts.  
Same sex marriages do nothing to advance the position of family. 
Same sex marriages are the antithesis of family. 
I encourage all members to support it.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to participate in the debate.  
She then wanted to know what that had to do with marriage. 
I told her that it had nothing to do with marriage.  
That is the role of the courts.  
However, the solution must be constitutional.  
That is the role that we Canadians have given to our courts.  
This term is often described as judicial activism. 
They do not do that. 
They are a very conservative court. 
I hope today's debate will not confuse anyone. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The hon. member said that the government does not have a policy on this. 
That is why Reformers brought forward the motion today. 
That is why it has been referred to as a red herring. 
I have served in opposition. 
It is clear what Reformers are doing. 
This is opposition for opposition sake. 
The courts have not changed the definition of marriage. 
The government has no intention of changing the definition of marriage. 
What we are intent on doing is ensuring that Canadians are not discriminated against.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
In that way the people are shut out of the process. 
That is what this is about today.  
The government does not want to do that. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
It has been quite fascinating to sit in the House and watch this debate. 
I will list for my colleagues some of the signs I see. 
Do we need clarification? 
I say we do. 
Do we need reaffirmation of the definition of marriage? 
One of the things I have watched is a redefinition of spouse. 
What do my own constituents say about it? 
They say that marriage must be as they have traditionally understood it.  
My answer is a resounding yes. 
Let us look outside Canada for evidence on whether marriage is being redefined elsewhere. 
It was not light at all.  
They handled it a different way from judicial activism. 
In both cases the public rejected the redefinition of marriage. 
The redefinition was renounced.  
That tells me whether or not the issue is on the table.  
I also stated that there were four steps. 
The second step was a redefinition of spouse. 
The third step was adoption. 
The fourth step would be a redefinition of marriage. 
I am delighted that my colleagues across the way will be supporting it. 
For those who cannot, I will be interested in listening to their rationale.  
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
I unequivocally congratulate the hon. member for bringing forward the motion. 
I agree with everything the previous speaker just said. 
It is absolutely critical that the House speak to this issue.  
Would the hon. member agree with these two statements?  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
The member for Yorkton-Melville said: 
That was said on May 2, 1996. 
My constituents disagree vigorously with that.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The Liberal Party of Canada is proposing a change. 
That is its own business. 
It can govern its own affairs as it wishes.  
That is fearmongering, they would have said.  
We can reference it. 
A dialogue is a two way conversation. 
It is not a monologue. 
I cannot imagine why this would be a controversial motion. 
I cannot imagine why the Liberal Party would propose to scrap this definition. 
Let us be clear. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
In his opinion, does he agree that it always should be?  
Madam Speaker, absolutely, and I appreciate the intervention.  
Marriage has enormous meaning. 
It has a certain objective meaning. 
Of course marriage means that. 
That is what a marriage is.  
However, there is a certain reality. 
We are simply affirming that basic metaphysical reality through this motion.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I would like the member to comment on that.  
Madam Speaker, the member for Crowfoot makes the point very well. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I agree with the Reform Party that we need to discuss these matters. 
I am not of course in agreement with the position proposed. 
The Reform Party motion reads as follows: 
We can see the imperative nature of this motion.  
But canonical law is not the issue here.  
I will give a bit of background here. 
I know that I have the House's full attention and I am delighted. 
This decision was the start of abundant jurisprudence.  
The government amended the law and we are grateful to it for doing so. 
There was the decision in Haig. 
Treasury Board amended this legislation. 
We would have preferred an omnibus bill. 
There are some 70 laws. 
That is what the Reform Party members are against. 
They have in fact introduced a motion against the Rosenberg decision.  
All those who agree with me applaud now. 
I would ask the hon. parliamentary secretary to keep her cool. 
I sense this may be going somewhere I do not wish to go.  
Why is that so? 
Because it is not part of our tax returns. 
So no one can say how many in the population are gay.  
Often they are involved in their communities. 
I say that even if marriage were legalized I would not commit to it.  
I dedicate these arguments to the Reform members and hope they will listen carefully. 
They vowed respect, fidelity, help and assistance to each other.  
They lived together without interruption from the start of their union. 
Why am I doing this? 
The basic conditions are the prerogative of the federal government. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there agreement in the House?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Madam Speaker, I move: 
ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
Madam Speaker, I move: 
Madam Speaker, I move: 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I would like to understand what they intend to do.  
The credit goes to the Reform Party for proposing it.  
I do not believe that it exists as a divine right. 
I believe it is also an intervention of the lawmaker. 
However, I hope that, with vigour, parliamentarians will reject this motion.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I realize a lot of other people would like to do that. 
Perhaps we will have to extend the debate.  
We are talking about the family, the fundamental building block of society. 
It is necessary that we discuss this and send a clear signal to the courts.  
Just one thing: the cost of cleaning up the wreckage. 
Simple marital breakdown is the leading cause of social problems, perhaps the leading cause. 
In other words, we are talking about the family. 
We are talking about children. 
I do not see the rationality of his remarks. 
I think there is a problem with his definition of family. 
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
I know that he has very serious concerns in this matter.  
That is what is called evolution.  
Now, however, there are. 
I think it must also- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I regret to interrupt the hon. member.  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The next question is on the main motion as amended.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion as amended?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
When we were discussing the amendment, I heard two or three no votes.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I really did not hear any noes at that time.  
MAIN ESTIMATES, 1999-2000 
CONCURRENCE IN VOTE 1-PARLIAMENT 
Hon. Don Boudria (for the President of the Treasury Board) moved: 
Let us all agree on one thing. 
Therefore, it must have the resources it needs to fulfil that role.  
My party has advocated such changes in the recent past.  
Our government has made modernizing our federation one of its top priorities. 
You don't amend the Senate by cutting the supply. 
That is the prerequisite. 
It is not cutting supply.  
That is the prerequisite for doing that under our constitution.  
They had many other topics in mind. 
Of course, the answer is obvious.  
I have just given one example. 
This too must not forgotten.  
He is an eminent Canadian who served as minister of agriculture for many years. 
He is a parliamentarian with three or four decades of experience. 
This is the calibre of people they are. 
There is also Frank Mahovlich, a world famous personality and a member of the Senate. 
I have named only a few. 
This is the sort of person who represents us in the other place. 
We must not forget it either.  
God knows how expensive these commissions can be, I remember some. 
They have contributed much to this process and will continue to do so. 
The government's position on Senate reform is simple. 
In the meantime, our government is pursuing the same policy, one of common sense. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
He says that there is no consensus on the Senate issue. 
According to the polling it is roughly 50:50. 
The minister also talked about giving the Senate supply. 
That is 16.1% over two years.  
None of them have been raised by 16.1% over two years. 
There is a consensus on that.  
The hon. member talked about the increases this year and last year. 
He made a comparison between the two houses of parliament. 
I will not reflect upon that vote. 
We voted and that is done. 
It sounds like a rather elementary proposition.  
I know that the NDP is not always together with the unions. 
Sometimes they have differences. 
In this case there is one.  
He can take it up with the union people. 
That is his privilege. 
I have told him that in answers in the House on several occasions.  
His first proposition was about reforming the Senate. 
Me too. What is the point? 
Some want to change the number of senators a jurisdiction has and so on. 
Some members across the way say they want a triple E Senate. 
They have a right to think that way. 
I do not happen to think that is proper and equitable.  
There has to be some other mechanism of arriving at that. 
Every province in Canada has a different definition of what that should be. 
Yes, I agree with him. 
I would prefer to see senators chosen by another system when the constitution is amended. 
That is not the point. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
That makes for a total of 38 seats. 
What has changed since some of these quotes were made? 
The first one reads: 
I...support Senate reform. 
The next one reads in part: 
-a reformed Senate is essential. 
It must be a Senate that is elected, effective and equitable.  
That appeared in Hansard of September 24, 1991. 
The next one reads: 
The Liberal government in two years will make it (Senate) elected. 
As Prime Minister I can take steps to make it happen.  
The next one reads: 
You want the triple E Senate and I want one too.  
That was a statement on February 2, 1990 to the Toronto Star . 
The next one reads: 
That can be found in Hansard of May 14, 1991. 
On February 1, 1997, the next one is: 
The last one reads: 
Those are all quotes from our current Prime Minister. 
He has quoted the Prime Minister so obviously I agree with what he just said.  
The Prime Minister has been quite forthright. 
He says that he favours Senate reform. 
Where was the hon. member and his colleagues? 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
At that time I received about 39% of the vote. 
How long will the government support paying salaries and expenses to these two convicted felons?  
I fundamentally disagree with the proposition of abolishing the Senate. 
Abolishing it outright is a different story. 
Personally I do not favour that. 
To repeat, I do not favour abolishing the Senate. 
I favour improving it. 
That is what I believe Canadians want. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in this way?  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will get this speech under way.  
Now that the Liberals are in power, they do nothing about the Senate.  
There are two things about the Senate. 
That is the reason we in the Reform Party say things have got to change.  
This has got to be called progress. 
We know where the NDP comes from. 
Progress may be glacial in its speed, but progress is being made.  
The Senate needs reform. 
The government could provide the impetus for reform if it wanted to. 
The Reform Party has said let us move on Senate reform. 
The government talks about Senate reform. 
The NDP says to abolish the Senate. 
Maybe one day we will make progress.  
I published a waste report today. 
It is available on the Internet. 
Let us look at a couple of things at the National Film Board. 
What else do we have in here? 
When we bring it all together our imaginations can run riot.  
He wants to hear more. 
How about Frank the Wrabbit . 
We must not let our imagination run off here. 
This is a film about how humans and rabbits formulate and justify beliefs. 
We will go from rabbits on to rats. 
The National Film Board was so enthusiastic that it threw $140,000 behind this effort.  
Then we are back into pornography. 
My waste report goes on.  
He said this was going to cost us big time. 
It was that simple. 
Is this good business? 
It is going to cost the taxpayer a bundle.  
The taxpayer ended up paying over $3 million. 
One has to wonder if this thing was even legitimate.  
One branch alone gave out 30 of these franchises and they all went bad. 
We picked up the tab. 
The auditor general told us about it in 1997 and the fruits are coming home.  
There are computers with legs on them. 
In my last waste report I talked about computers with legs. 
It is not even reported to the police. 
We are paying for that. 
The taxpayers are paying for that. 
They are robbing them blind and taking it for themselves. 
It cannot be allowed to continue. 
Yet the Liberals continue to allow it. 
We wonder why we keep having to pay more and more money in that direction. 
Openness and transparency are absolutely fundamental to a healthy democracy.  
The Privacy Act prevails, which says it cannot be made public.  
It called for three fundamental things. 
Second, it goes on to ask how well this public policy is being addressed. 
Once that is articulated we can measure it. 
However, the government does not want to measure it. 
Waste and mismanagement is everywhere. 
Surely we could make progress.  
Can we achieve the same results in a different way?  
It is too much of an effort to change. 
We do not want to bring accountability into government. 
It was a defence of the status quo. 
The response to the business of supply was a defence of the status quo. 
The government has the responsibility to manage the country. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Theoretically it is an interesting idea.  
Of course, that was turned down in the referendum. 
The hon. member is a frugal man and wants to look after the public purse. 
We spend roughly $60 million a year on the existing Senate. 
How long do we go on trying? 
It is a bit like the dog chasing its tail. 
The hon. member from Sarnia is confirming that. 
About a year ago, it was about 45%. 
Somebody else wants the house of the provinces or the house of the federation. 
The hon. member from Calgary may want a mixture of powers. 
We could never find consensus.  
How long do we wait, Mr. Speaker? 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
With respect to having the upper chamber elected, for me that is a non-starter. 
He is a Tory.  
Mr. Speaker, we have to think about these non-starters. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to pose a challenge to my hon. colleague. 
I do not want to be too vague on this. 
I got it right. 
Hallelujah, one for me.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
This is a debate about the supply motion. 
We are being told that the Senate is a legitimate body. 
Legally, that is absolute correct. 
The Senate of Canada today is legally a legitimate body. 
It is half of the Parliament of Canada. 
The Senate was better educated, more worldly and more outward looking. 
By and large, senators were better off. 
That was very acceptable. 
If we flash ahead 132 years, much has changed in the country. 
We had no supreme court in 1867. 
That would not come until the days of Alexander Mackenzie in the 1870s. 
We move ahead 132 years and what do we have? 
We have the Supreme Court of Canada which came into existence in 1949. 
Until that point, we still sent our appeals to the Privy Council in Great Britain.  
They are all checks on the House of Commons. 
The Senate only works about 66 half days a year. 
Political legitimacy has passed them by. 
However, they are still in a place where they have legal legitimacy. 
They are there and they have ``a job'' to do.  
We have heard reference to polls today. 
It is statutory requirements. 
The Senate estimates have eight headings, such as information and rentals. 
What does this all mean? 
I have no idea what it means. 
It is easy to say that senators are doing their job. 
I have no disagreement with that. 
They have a job to do and it is in our constitutional framework. 
It was set in stone in 1867. 
We should not talk about this being an all or nothing proposition. 
It is clearly not that. 
One of the motions calls for zero dollars for the Senate. 
The second one calls for zero dollars to the Senate. 
What are we looking at in the Senate? 
I think we can all understand and agree with that. 
People in the public service have certainly not had raises for a number of years. 
However there is a big but that I want to emphasize and underline. 
That is my opinion. 
All Canadians ask is that their political institutions be reasonable. 
I have noted that no one is getting this kind of increase whatsoever.  
The Senate says it is doing its job. 
I think to a certain extent it has a function to perform. 
I learned from certain media representatives that the Senate was concerned about the demonstration. 
I do not know. 
We have the right in this place to pass judgment on appropriation. 
We can argue that change at another time. 
Yet it uses that institutional shield to protect itself from change.  
I am not talking about profound change in the sense of downsizing. 
We cannot change its constitutional mandate. 
We are being told by the Senate that we have no choice. 
We will pass it or it will have a work stoppage.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Perhaps he could nod his head yes or no.  
He has never heard of Mr. Balfour. 
He was a friend of the then prime minister. 
He is a Conservative who comes from my home town in Regina.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the NDP for his question. 
I must say that I have never heard of this individual. 
It is not my habit to comment on individuals from the other place.  
I want to respond in general to his question. 
The House of Lords is identical to our Senate in terms of accountability. 
It has imposed that its members have to show up to get paid. 
It is tied to performance.  
I recognize there are people in the other place who believe they represent their regions. 
I come from southwestern Ontario. 
For the last two years we have had a senator from southwestern Ontario. 
I like him and all that. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I would like to pose a question to my hon. colleague. 
Is the Senate accountable to the taxpayer? 
According to the Senate it is not accountable to the House of Commons. 
I do not believe that the Senate is accountable to taxpayers. 
To whom is it accountable?  
I agree the Senate is not accountable to taxpayers. 
There is absolutely no question about that whatsoever. 
Is it accountable to the House of Commons? 
Are they accountable to the Prime Minister? 
I think the answer is no but we could argue about that. 
Of course they were accountable to other prime ministers but they have come and gone.  
I think my position on it is well known.  
Mr. Speaker, I pose another question to my hon. colleague. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I know what the hon. member is saying in his question. 
It is quite a large number of dollars. 
That is the only person I can think of.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will say a word or two about the motion before the House. 
That is roughly half of what the Senate spends in a year. 
The Senate costs about $60 million a year.  
A year, and it goes up almost every year. 
That seems like a lot of money for the member for Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre.  
Sixty million dollars is being spent. 
He would not appear. 
Every department has to appear before the relevant committee of the House. 
I can hear him rattling his head from this far away. 
His constituents are watching as they flip channels tonight. 
No senator has justified the expenditures. 
They are not doing that.  
The member for Sarnia-Lambton did not know who Senator James Balfour was. 
They can call a senator at 1-800-267-7362. 
Does the member for Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre remember that number? 
Can the member from Calgary remember that number?  
That is what the Canadian people should be doing tonight and tomorrow. 
Pick up a phone and call their favourite senator. 
People should do that.  
We had a little demonstration outside the Senate today. 
No one from the Conservatives was there. 
They did not show up. 
Their caucus is dominated by senators. 
They were not there. 
They have a lot of senators in that caucus. 
They could have been there protesting this huge cash grab by the Senate of Canada.  
About 5% of the people support the existing Senate. 
The rest either want to abolish it or reform it, change it in some way. 
It has been tried ad nauseam year in and year out. 
We have had 132 years of the existing Senate. 
In 1867 the people elected the house of commoners. 
The people here were commoners. 
That was the House of Lords or the Senate in this country.  
I believe we are never going to reform the Senate. 
Prince Edward Island has 130,000 people. 
I believe it is never going to happen.  
A lot of that power should be taken away.  
I also think of the Supreme Court of Canada and federal judges. 
He is a very wonderful person. 
I am not criticizing him. 
But that was not the position he should have been appointed to.  
I also believe that other powers should be taken away from the prime minister. 
I think we should look at that as well. 
I want to make one final comment this evening, which is a bit more radical.  
A bit more radical. 
I have presented a private member's bill to this effect. 
This would give some regional representation to the central institution of parliament.  
It got 38%, with a turnout of about 67%. 
The turnout has been plummeting in the last 30 years. 
Why waste my vote? 
Politicians do not listen. 
How I vote does not seem to make any difference''. 
In many cases that is absolutely true.  
They were in 1945 with Mackenzie King and in 1958 with John Diefenbaker. 
We have other distortions in the House of Commons. 
The Conservative Party got 20 seats and the Reform Party got 60 seats.  
We had the same vote as the Bloc Quebecois.  
Therefore, most people consider that their vote is wasted. 
Most Canadians voted for losing candidates. 
A person could vote NDP in southern Alberta and that vote would count. 
A person could vote Reform in Newfoundland and that vote would count. 
A person could even vote Conservative in Saskatchewan and that vote would count. 
Every other parliamentary system in the world has it except Canada.  
What we need in this country is big democracy. 
Allow the people in. 
Let the people's voice be heard. 
Let the people say what they want in this country. 
That is the way we should go.  
Does anybody agree with that? 
Why do they vote that way?  
I know they are Conservatives, but 132 years of the status quo? 
How in God's name can those members vote that way?  
I know the member campaigned on behalf of David Orchard. 
We need serious parliamentary and electoral change. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
The reaction in my riding was extremely virulent. 
The Senate line may well follow suit before long if people keep on calling.  
This will encourage the senators to retire.  
Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member for Quebec East. 
We need unanimous consent for a great many things. 
In other cases the section 42 formula applies. 
I therefore agree with the hon. member.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very closely to what the member for Regina-Qu'Appelle said. 
He made some excellent points. 
Without question, the Canadian public does not support a non-elected Senate. 
I would like the hon. member's comments on that.  
Let us have an elected Senate. 
Let us do something about it. 
Let us do something progressive and positive. 
I will offer my support to reform the Senate, but not to abolish it. 
It is as simple as that. 
I would like to have the hon. member's comments on that.  
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what more I could add. 
Pollara did a poll which indicated that it was a bit higher than that. 
We should unite in terms of getting rid of the status quo. 
I would like to see that be the real debate. 
At that time I will obviously be continuing my support for abolition. 
If it is elected, it is legitimate. 
It seems to me that is something the Reform Party has always stood against.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Subclause 6(2) at page 3 of the bill states: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
MAIN ESTIMATES, 1999-2000 
CONCURRENCE IN VOTE 1-PARLIAMENT 
The House resumed consideration of Motion No. 1.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The Bloc will never form government. 
As for the Reform Party, we do not know where it is. 
It would be best for Canadians if they did not come back to the House.  
Let me talk about a couple of issues. 
We are dealing with government appropriations for many departments. 
We are having a Senate bashing debate. 
Mr. Speaker, if members would listen they would learn something. 
We will not get into those debates now. 
I have an advantage because my party has members sitting in the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wonder if you could rule on that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
No, not at all sir.  
The Senate did a wonderful job. 
The senators went out and listened to the Canadian public. 
They were accountable to the Canadian public. 
They made changes that made the legislation better. 
With a stroke of a pen the Reform Party would abolish the Senate. 
The Reform Party has no plans. 
Should there be reconstruction of the existing Senate? 
Let us not do it with vitriolic balderdash. 
Let me give the House some ideas that were put forward in the Charlottetown accord. 
The Charlottetown accord came forward with restructuring of the Senate in mind. 
Who did not support it? 
The governance of the country was not important to that party. 
Let me tell the House about the Senate. 
The Senate has helped me in the job that I do. 
I have that opportunity. 
They are very accessible and very open.  
Ask them their opinion. 
There are good and bad in every house. 
Where would we be?  
Do we want Ontario to run Canada? 
The Reform Party has a mantra that the west wants in. 
We talked about an elected Senate. 
They simply like to push the button.  
I looked at the American system. 
I look at the American senate which is elected. 
They stop each other. 
They block each other. 
That is not good for democracy either. 
I am not so sure that the elected side of it should be there.  
Let me talk about the reform in the Charlottetown accord. 
At one point in time a senator was appointed for life. 
Should we have term limitations? 
Personally I could support a term limitation on the appointment of a senator.  
There is nothing wrong with that. 
We do it in the House. 
Our gauge and our standard is obviously an election. 
The Senate should have gauges and standards as well.  
It was also said that senators do not do anything. 
There was an urgency because we were going to protect the Canadian heritage. 
We were going to make sure that we would not back down from the Americans. 
It was a piece of legislation that was absolutely necessary. 
Where is Bill C-55 now? 
This government will be accountable for that. 
It was to take pensions away from superannuates. 
There will be accountability to the government because we have that check and balance.  
Do not get me wrong. 
It is not the way to do it.  
Because Reform wants to Senate bash. 
That is all it wants to do. 
Frankly, Canadians are losing when they have representation from the Reform Party.  
I believe in the electorate. 
I believe the electorate does the right thing. 
In this case, they certainly did the right thing.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I have never met the guy. 
Regina is a small city with about 200,000 people. 
One was the former deputy premier, Eric Berntson, who is now a senator. 
For a $50 million budget, I certainly have no difficulty in keeping that house.  
That does not mean the status quo must stay. 
Instead, they voted against the Charlottetown accord. 
That would have been in place.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I collected petitions on the whole idea of Senate reform and Senate election. 
Other members of the House collected petitions on the issue of Senate abolition. 
They did not get responses from senators or from the Prime Minister's office.  
The hon. member talked about phoning senators and the Prime Minister's office. 
The member of the NDP mentioned the number. 
I ask the hon. member if- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He is writing on the back of it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for South Shore is quite correct. 
I should have stopped it immediately. 
Mr. Speaker, I apologize. 
There was a question about the Prime Minister as well.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
If the hon. member gets away with it once, shame on me. 
If he gets away with it twice, really, that is it.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not think there was anything of any substance in those comments.  
Actually people do not have to call the 1-800 number. 
What was it going to do? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
I am looking for the right adjective. 
Mr. Speaker, Manitoba already has the third of the 20% of the seats. 
We have seven senators currently in the province of Manitoba.  
You only have six.  
Six senators, excuse me. 
I was looking for the one from Regina. 
I missed that one.  
Even you don't know where he's at.  
I don't know where he's at. 
I was looking for the seventh senator.  
I very honestly suggest to the hon. member that obviously would require a constitutional change. 
I am prepared to look at anything that will give better representation to the country. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Let us look back at the context in which it was created.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron: -aging place, to say the least. 
That takes some doing.  
What is the democratic prerogative of such an institution? 
These people experience anger, confusion and indignation.  
But the institution itself, because of its nature, is the source of the problem.  
Every single provincial legislature has got rid of their legislative councils. 
There is no connection whatsoever. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
There is another example. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Vercheres-Les-Patriotes for his excellent speech. 
As a political scientist, he is obviously very up on these issues.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for his question. 
I think he has hit it on the head.  
In Quebec, we already have the feeling we are paying for two structures. 
Each senator in Quebec represents what is called a Senate division. 
The choices made by this government are totally unacceptable. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
The narrow definition is not the fault of all the opposite side of the House. 
I think the blame lies equally. 
He was complaining that he was forced to retire at that age. 
This is solely within federal power.  
It would be possible to extend the age issue. 
Unless we go the ultimate route of a constituent assembly.  
There is no particular evidence of that.  
We badly need to re-examine the relationship of executive and legislative power. 
They have largely been left to one side.  
Something obviously is needed: a little more comprehensive thinking.  
Should a legislative body not be doing that? 
It is quite obvious that the House of Commons cannot do it. 
The cause of Senate reform is I think an interesting one. 
That is one of the realities.  
I welcome the suggestions that have been made. 
Will we get around to these larger questions? 
I have raised this issue. 
I think the next generation of Canadians will have a rendezvous with the constitution. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague for his speech. 
I know he takes a great interest in these matters.  
I will share a fond memory with him. 
I have trouble seeing how we could be interested in reforming the voting method. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to lead into my question with a quote, which states: 
I...support Senate reform. 
It must be a Senate that is elected, effective and equitable''.  
As Prime Minister I can take steps to make it happen''.  
I put it to my hon. colleague:
Who could that person be?  
I think honour is due where it falls.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Senators are obsessed but the truth shall be known.  
I wanted to put those reasons on the record because they are very important. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I can think of some things that happened recently in the House of Commons. 
The government in its wisdom changed that to age 14.  
Let us look at some other things that happened. 
After talking to some senators, I think the answer is no.  
The fact is that the government said it shall occur. 
That is the problem with an unelected Senate which is not effective.  
That is totally improper.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
For the Prime Minister to give us- 
Who was that one member?  
That one member is here too. 
Here she is, the member for Beaver River. 
The point is that many Canadians voted against it. 
The problems with drugs in the country are very serious. 
We are long past that situation.  
In British Columbia there are 15,000 addicts. 
It talks about $1,057,933 for the Canadian Canoe Museum. 
Where are the priorities of the government? 
Members across the way do not know what they are talking about. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I must interrupt the hon. member at this time.  
APPROPRIATION BILL-SPEAKER'S RULING 
The reference is not at all needed and is in fact, in my view, misleading. 
I want to thank the hon. member for St. Albert for his vigilance.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
