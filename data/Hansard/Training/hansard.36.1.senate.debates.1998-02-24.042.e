Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Tuesday, February 24, 1998 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Memories of 1998 Games at Nagano, Japan 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We all have magic memories of golden moments at Nagano. 
They watched, laughed, and blew horns at the athletes. 
International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Canada is also the home to national organizations that are active in helping these victims. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senator, I regret to interrupt you, but your three-minute period has expired. 
Conclusion of 1998 Games at Nagano-Congratulations to Canada's Athletes 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
Sixth place out of the entire world! 
That is a magnificent success, not a failure. 
Fundamental, radical changes took place during his stewardship. 
These are but a few of the achievements.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to continue?  
The Late Kathleen Shannon 
The press release issued by the National Film Board tells us the following: 
According to filmmaker Terre Nash ( If You Love This Planet ): 
If the back door was closed, she would let us in through the windows.  
To her family and her friends we offer our sympathy and our profound appreciation.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Black History Month has been celebrated in Canada since 1970. 
The positive accomplishments of our community in Canada have received scant, if any, recognition. 
This past month has been most rewarding. 
Let knowledge and understanding triumph over ignorance and intolerance. 
Help us build bridges between our communities. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, perhaps Senator Kinsella would explain his suggestion.  
Under those circumstances that would be a debatable motion. 
I was trying to get around the problems we have been experiencing on Wednesdays. 
Perhaps we could reflect upon that, or perhaps identify some other technique.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Depository Bills and Notes Bill 
Tuesday, February 24, 1998 
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has the honour to present its 
Page 5, clause 17: replacing line 36 with the following: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Tuesday, February 24, 1997 
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has the honour to present its 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I would not want what has happened today to become a precedent. 
However, we will accept the tabling of the report today, as it is here.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Her major is in political science. 
Katherine is from Toronto.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I certainly would not do so in this chamber.  
What is to be done?  
Compensation Promised to Victims of Hepatitis C-Government Position 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators , my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That matter was one of the subjects of discussion. 
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Health-care cut-backs are being blamed for the crunch in available beds.  
What is happening in Winnipeg is not an isolated incident. 
People are suffering from a lack of federal funds to health care.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, is this not called buck passing? 
Where does the buck stop? 
Is it not with the leader and his government? 
That is exactly not true.  
I do not believe you.  
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
According to this report, half of the 338 clinics do not meet standards. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is a very valid suggestion raised by Honourable Senator LeBreton. 
What were they three years ago?  
That is not what the provinces are saying.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
As a result, we hope that a stable, predictable funding plan will result.  
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I know the feeling.  
These are not difficult questions. 
These are not complicated questions. 
They have to do with a bill that originated in this house. 
Does your minister use an alternative fuel?  
None of these are difficult questions. 
Yet the government seems to have extraordinary difficulty in providing answers. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am thankful for the reminder. 
We shall take action today. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
However, other countries are now coming forward.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government :
The Minister of Foreign Affairs is an advocate for these very important causes. 
In fact, he himself has brought them forward on a number of occasions. 
Possible Celebration for Olympic Athletes-Government Position 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
He was there proudly representing Canada, and he was part of the team.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I am sure honourable senators are listening silently, and that they do not disagree. 
I certainly do not hear any disagreement.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I do not know if those two conversations have taken place.  
Child Custody and Access 
Senate Representation on Steering Committee of Special Joint Committee-Question to Joint Chairman 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Generally speaking, there are one or two senators on it. 
That is the way in which it was set up. 
It is not the decision-making body of the committee. 
Honourable senators, I think the senator has misunderstood me. 
Are the two senators, then, members of the committee?  
Each time the senators are there, they are members of the committee.  
Then is the steering committee not a fixed group? 
And of that number, how many are senators?  
Sometimes one and sometimes two.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, it is quite extraordinary. 
My further question to the Joint Chairman of that committee is:
What was the selection process that was used to hire this person? 
How many candidates were considered for the position? 
Last, but not least, what are the credentials and the qualifications of this individual?  
I would need to write down the particulars of it. 
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Marjory LeBreton on February 10, 1998) 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on February 12, 1998) 
Answers to Order Paper Questions Tabled 
Energy-Marine Atlantic Inc.-Conformity with Alternative Fuels Act 
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Bill 
Question of Privilege-Speaker's Ruling 
The Hon. the Speaker :
There are copies available. 
I would ask the Pages to distribute them to all honourable senators.  
At this point, Senator Taylor joined in with some comments. 
According to him, and I quote: 
I will take it as given that they were raised at the first opportunity.  
It is a publication. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I would like to raise a point of order. 
I think this is the appropriate time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Speaker's decisions may not be appealed.  
No, I would never invoke a point of order regarding the Speaker's decision.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
You may appeal, but the decisions are not subject to discussion.  
Honourable senators, this may be a very small point, but it is very important. 
We are all members of Parliament.  
The press keeps repeating what sometimes we ourselves say:
That there are two groups to consider here, Members of Parliament and senators.  
That was not right. 
I am a member of Parliament, and I am proud to be in the Senate.  
Canadian Wheat Board Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
There are many areas that require change.  
Why all the controversy about this bill? 
First, we must look at what is happening in agriculture. 
I will give you a couple of examples. 
Somehow, the ground has shifted.  
The question of subsidies arose. 
Perhaps we are taking food for granted.  
I happen to think we do. 
It is a great program - one of the best. 
A farmer gives a bushel of wheat and the government meets it two to one. 
Why all the controversy? 
That is a tremendous increase.  
What is happening on the Prairies? 
The feed industry is changing. 
Some senators will remember the name Charlie Mayer. 
What did we get? 
We got $1.6 billion. 
This transition has created many problems and many frustrations. 
You may be familiar with the situation in Brandon. 
Maple Leaf Foods is moving a plant to Brandon. 
These are major changes - and quick changes.  
Iowa beef producers bought out Lakeside. 
I could say more about the cost of production. 
What do you do in that situation? 
Why all the controversy about a bill like this? 
Well, a bill like this is very important.  
I do not see any big problem with that. 
Some groups are very much opposed to this change. 
They say, "You are breaking down the Canadian Wheat Board." 
Exactly what is the inclusion clause? 
Today, canola is worth $9 a bushel. 
You can understand why there is that nervousness. 
I personally have some trouble with it. 
I think that inclusion clause is a serious matter.  
What about that vote? 
How is the question worded? 
Who gets to vote? 
The inclusion and exclusion clause has become a subject of great concern. 
That might be something that the Senate committee could consider. 
I would favour that, but some thought must be given to the inclusion factor.  
Honourable senators, there is also the cash buy-back issue. 
Canadian farmers are looking at building one there and in Swift Current. 
They could do an individual buy-out. 
Many people are opposed to that. 
Again, we are facing a world that is changing. 
We have a global economy and that raises the whole question of other marketing boards. 
In fact, it is quite a bit less. 
We have all this feed because of freight rates. 
There must be changes.  
Apparently, any province can opt in or out of the marketing board. 
There are only approximately 900,000 of us.  
So much for the cash buy-back.  
On the other hand, it is important that there be some flexibility. 
Let me give you an example of what happens in reality. 
We were looking at No. 2 durum with no protein. 
It was selling in the Pioneer elevator in Estevan for $4.71 a bushel. 
The Canadian Wheat Board wanted me to buy that back at $7.17 a bushel. 
It works out to the same thing.  
These are the types of problems we are facing. 
That raises the whole subject of a monopoly. 
This is complicated legislation. 
It is not easy to obtain agreement from farmers on issues such as these.  
There is some discrepancy about how great the losses were. 
Is the government being let off the hook on this issue? 
This subject is also ignored in the proposed legislation.  
One other area that is of real concern to farmers is the board of directors. 
There is some concern about this composition.  
I can see both sides of the issue there.  
Another concern relates to the powers of the board. 
What are the powers of the board? 
We need to hear from the farmers as to what their concerns are. 
This is an important bill. 
I did want to mention the issue of trade. 
Honourable senators, we have a good committee. 
I believe senators from both sides of the house have significant experience in agriculture. 
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrrow :
Honourable senators, I have two questions. 
The Honourable Senator Gustafson mentioned the subject of buying and selling durum wheat. 
That is right, Honourable Senator Sparrow.  
I thank the honourable senator for his assistance. 
The producer would have shared in the $7 in the final payment received. 
That is what the honourable senator is telling me.  
Perhaps the honourable senator could explain this.  
I could be wrong.  
That would be just the administration costs of handling, would it not? 
Therefore, this is not an unreasonable figure; is that correct?  
That has nothing to do with the transportation. 
What else is new?  
The honourable senator has answered his own question. 
I recently attended the opening of a new plant. 
That is eight cars. 
That allows them to load a unit train of 100 cars in eight hours. 
The grain industry is changing and changing quickly. 
Grain transportation and freight rates will undergo change. 
Senator Gustafson outlined that for us very clearly.  
In its early years, the Wheat Board was a voluntary pooling agency for wheat. 
I guess unlike private corporations.  
They want our marketing system to more closely approximate theirs. 
The point is that the operations of the Canadian Wheat Board are controversial. 
They have always been controversial and they will very likely always be controversial. 
I will not reiterate all of them. 
Certainly this is a step towards a more democratic board with greater accountability to farmers. 
I am not sure what sort of government corporation it is.  
Many are unhappy with that proposal. 
On the one hand, some predict that the inclusion clause will permit a power grab. 
The scenarios are both woolly and wild.  
On motion of Senator Berntson, debate adjourned.  
Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The same is true for telecommunications. 
Canada has built one of the finest telecommunications networks in the world. 
Honourable senators, it is clauses 1, 3 and 7 that are troubling. 
Let us deal with the second assertion first. 
Indeed, the CRTC had to deal with one such case recently. 
The Government of Canada has other tools at its disposal for stopping this predatory practice. 
They are also all that is needed for Canada's international telecommunications market.  
This power, I repeat, is contrary to the doctrine of forbearance - forbearance from regulation. 
Managed competition assures us of none of this.  
As John Milton wrote in Tenure of Kings and Magistrates in 1649: 
One can only come to the conclusion that there is none. 
The Canadian Bar Association further submits: 
The level gridiron that I propose is not new. 
In fact, you observe its operation every day. 
It can be found in virtually all unregulated markets in the Canadian economy. 
At the same time, the competitive marketplace continues to grow. 
But this is better viewed as a compromise position. 
Bill C-17 raises other concerns as well. 
One would be quite correct to interpret the term "apparatus" to mean computers. 
This must not be allowed to happen.  
Honourable senators, our duty is clear. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Honourable senators, I move adoption of this report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I will try to be helpful as to the magnitude of this study.  
The minister has a responsibility to those people and for their lands.  
That accommodation was section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
Senators are quite familiar with that topic. 
It has been discussed. 
I would like this committee to focus on that issue. 
We owe it to the aboriginal people, as well as the citizens of Canada. 
We do not know that yet. 
The magnitude of the area on which we need to focus is great. 
Various sets of options need to be examined.  
The other relationship to be expected is that of the regional government. 
As well, we must examine provincial jurisdiction under section 92. 
We are talking about a parliament within a Parliament.  
What period is the money for, and when will it be paid?  
The amount of the budget approved by the Internal Economy Committee is very limited. 
I looked at the amount of money spent by other committees. 
I know this amount is high. 
That may be unusual in the Senate. 
Can the honourable senator help us understand the proposal presently before us? 
Honourable senators, no one has been hired yet. 
Honourable senators, I am not sure if I understood the question.  
Your answer would be that we might be short. 
If this money is not spent, it is not spent. 
I think the rules in that area need to be changed. 
Is that clear in the honourable senator's mind? 
We are not buying into anything other than what is here.  
Honourable senators, I fully understand that. 
I might as well take this matter somewhere else. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Concerns of Albertans-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Richard J. Doyle :
What a collection of molehills has emerged from formal studies of the place. 
He saw no value in Croll-like investigations. 
Why should the Senate waste time?  
I wrote the following for the January 1991 issue of The Idler Magazine : 
One cannot repeat often enough that we do not seek compensation for anyone. 
We have no interest in claims whatever their nature. 
We do not even presume that the courts will rule in favour of the claimants. 
To be blunt, we are indifferent to the conclusion of any court action.  
He has only recently switched to urging, and I quote: 
...total abolition without prejudice to the Senate's re-invention.  
He writes approvingly, and again I quote: 
It still has reforms to tackle. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
One large change can change the entire thrust of a bill. 
I practically fell off my stool. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I have two questions for Senator Doyle:
Is there a role for the independents?  
Is it not time to reach 50/50?  
That was in former days.  
Seriously, I think it is always wrong to set specific numbers or percentages. 
However, I was not jesting when I was talking about the pleasures of independent status.  
There were independent senators before, and some even chaired committees. 
There was Senator Pitfield, who was a very able chairman. 
It adds only one more. 
There have been all these years of waiting. 
I was told, "If you vote with us, you can be on the committee." 
If I did that, though, I would no longer be an independent. 
It would be very easy. 
I think this problem could be solved. 
I do not want to have a clash with colleagues.  
However, I am sure that there will still be some that will seem unfair.  
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Doyle. 
As Senator Stewart said, deals were made. 
Of course, pre-study prohibited that in many instances.  
Neither committee learned the full story on an issue.  
On motion of Senator Gigantes, debate adjourned.  
Canada's Policy in Current Crisis-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, the countdown has stopped. 
We must thank him for his efforts.  
...seems more opaque than transparent.  
Under such circumstances, how can doubt not be cast on Canada's position? 
The government's responses contradict the information provided by the vaccine manufacturer. 
Why deny the evidence? 
Why hide the facts?  
I realize the situation with Iraq is not simple, indeed not. 
There are always two sides to the coin. 
A war with Iraq, certainly, but what will be the effect on the Middle East? 
What will be the effect on the Arab-Israeli peace process? 
We know that Islamic extremists have gained strength. 
One wrong move and the entire situation could go out of control.  
But many experts disagree.  
One of them is Professor Weller of Cambridge University. 
Military strategists set objectives, work out scenarios, and assess risks.  
So what is the mission? 
Who located the target of the strike? 
What is the probability of failure and what would its consequences be? 
When are we to declare a victory?  
Who has given agreement for women and children to be killed?  
That resolution was implemented in May 1997. 
That is not surprising. 
Here is what is known of the situation from a humanitarian point of view. 
Clearly, the economic sanctions are working very well. 
The situation is alarming as far as the children are concerned. 
Once again, victims have been taken hostage.  
I am not one of them. 
This is a serious matter that warrants serious consideration by the government.  
He is wrong on several counts. 
It is not such a great idea to test chemical weapons on your own people. 
It is not such a great idea to let them die. 
In the case of doubt, it is better to leave well enough alone. 
This cannot be left in the hands of a few crazed megalomaniacs. 
This is a worthy subject for reflection in long periods of peace.  
On motion of Senator Gigantes, debate adjourned.  
Motion Proposing an Amendment-Debate Continued 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
I am happy that Senator Gigantes is here today. 
I share his view. 
Canadians are being asked to take increased responsibility for their own retirement planing. 
The media has also reported often on the need to increase the foreign property rule. 
These problems would disappear if the absurd 80-per-cent rule were lifted.  
Clearly, honourable senators, the CPP fund is all about the retirement of average Canadians. 
Three points require emphasis.  
These remarks may be properly categorized as reflecting economic nationalism. 
To date, we have seen no proof of this. 
It seems to me from the experience of Canada that the opposite is true. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to allow the honourable senator to continue?  
I encourage all honourable senators to support the motion.  
On motion of Senator Gigantes, debate adjourned.  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. Lorna Milne moved: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
We have been over this ground again and again. 
I think I understand why Senator Milne has proposed this motion. 
Honourable senators, I cannot dispel them; I can only acknowledge them. 
In fact, that is why I am on my feet and making this motion.  
I wonder if Senator Milne would have any comment on that.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, February 25, 1998, at 1:30 p.m.
