LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL PURPOSES 
Amendment to the amendment negatived 
Motion, as amended, agreed to 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 230 
Tuesday, May 25, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL REASONS 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
It deals with the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes.  
As a physician, I personally do not care. 
We have no interest whatsoever in furthering that. 
In fact, we would like to prevent it. 
The bill deals with the medical use of marijuana.  
If nobody would want to consume the substances production would have to stop. 
This is no small problem. 
The problems for people suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome cannot be understated. 
They have a number of other problems such as cognitive deficiencies. 
They have irreversible brain damage.  
The child becomes marginalized. 
It is a terrible vicious cycle which is very difficult to break. 
I implore the government to look at the national head start program. 
Look at what the Minister of Labour has done. 
The benefits of doing this are dramatic on a number of levels. 
They found a massive decrease in welfare. 
Children stayed in school longer.  
In closing, the motion is a good one. 
It needs to be applied to the medicinal use of marijuana. 
We would like to see medical studies to substantiate this. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
The legislative challenges are imposing but the government is committed to meeting them. 
The legal realities cannot be ignored. 
That is where we run into the complexity of this issue. 
The domestic supply here in Canada is also being explored.  
International obligations must be met. 
These are our treaty obligations.  
This has not been established in any country.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
In addition, we note that seniors are speaking out more and more. 
They are defending their ideas and their rights. 
People cannot be insensitive to the suffering of thousands of people in ill health. 
This is an issue of compassion. 
Mr. Pariseau is a terminally ill AIDS patient. 
He uses marijuana to relieve nausea and stimulate his appetite. 
Fortunately, there are some judges who are showing some compassion. 
It is hard to call upon judges to make a decision on a societal debate. 
He seems incapable of setting any real and reasonable deadline.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Yes, we have to put precautions in place. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We are on the horns of a classic dilemma. 
I want to be clear. 
In fact it is quite the contrary. 
The key words here are health and medical purposes. 
Delay in bringing this about will cause further pain and suffering for those afflicted.  
Courts have recognized the humane need. 
The guidance document makes no reference to the severity of illness. 
It does not distinguish between terminal and non-terminal cases. 
There is a number of ambiguities.  
The health minister is simply taking too long. 
Those individuals will continue to suffer until legislation is passed.  
A number of facts about marijuana have been touched upon already. 
It reduces spasms in victims who are suffering from multiple sclerosis. 
It reduces nausea in the treatment of cancer patients. 
It helps alleviate depression and regain appetite in those suffering from AIDS. 
There are no real side effects, aside from some dulling of the senses. 
The Canadian Police Association has taken a very positive view of this step. 
There are certainly noble reasons to permit the medical use of marijuana.  
These plants vary from plant to plant with respect to dosage. 
There is concern as well about research in this area. 
There is no consistency in terms of the product available at this time. 
Different drugs will have a different effect on individuals. 
The patient's perspective is something that has to be emphasized. 
I do not advocate that position at all. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Orders of the day will commence at noon.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 11.46 a.m.) 
The House resumed at 12.00 p.m. 
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Please allow me to set the record straight.  
They have assumed all the risks.  
What would happen in future if surpluses were to accumulate? 
It will thus be entirely free in its investment decisions. 
This board will be of benefit to our employees.  
Our employees have nothing to lose and everything to gain with this new organization. 
The government guarantees the integrity of the benefits provided through its employees' pension funds. 
In simple terms this means better benefits for our employees.  
I can even think of private companies like Sears, Dow Chemical or Shell.  
For a long time we have needed to take action and we have taken action. 
This bill will modernize and improve public sector pension plans. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
He says they feel good about it. 
I wonder who he has been talking to. 
The minister talked about the fair and equitable contents of this bill. 
``I was cut off''.  
Has Bill C-78 provided redress for this issue? 
They did not want to provide for their widows and orphans. 
They made that election. 
It cannot be fair.  
We have come a long way. 
People no longer ask for their employer's permission to get married. 
I said yes but the person could dispute that. 
We are talking here about survivor benefits. 
How it intends to police that, it really has no idea. 
It intends to leave it up to the courts.  
I am sure that would take some of the enthusiasm out of one night stands. 
That went by the wayside. 
Then people did not bother to get married. 
Then it did not matter that it was the opposite sex. 
Goodness knows where it is going to end up.  
I am at a loss. 
It is very disappointing. 
This is not parliament expressing its will. 
This is parliament being railroaded into rubber stamping what the government wants.  
We have not examined the ramifications of where it is leading us.  
The $30 billion is another issue which I find rather contemptuous. 
This is the largest fully indexed pension plan existing in the country today. 
It is not because of overcontribution by the government. 
It is not because of overcontribution by the employees either. 
The government wants to take that money. 
It wants to take the money that was contributed by itself and the employees. 
In the private sector it is totally illegal. 
It would not be allowed under any circumstances.  
There had to be a vote by the membership. 
Why did he not put this to a vote? 
There are two other major fundamental issues in the bill. 
The government says it cannot have that. 
The other one is the privatization of the plan. 
Perhaps that is not a bad situation. 
They share in the risk if the return is lower. 
I do not think the government is being honest and forthright. 
It went through committee in less than four hours. 
Closure has been introduced twice on this bill. 
What can I say? 
I find that rather odious. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
He pointed out some very significant shortcomings in this piece of legislation.  
I would like to build on some of the points he made this morning. 
These are not false accusations. 
It is the truth. 
Constituents will not know the reasons and will not understand all the nuances.  
This is not what it has done.  
The bill refers to the phrase ``a relationship of a conjugal nature''.  
According to Black's Law Dictionary conjugal means sexual activity. 
We are left with assuming it means what the Canadians dictionaries mean.  
This is the focus of the substantive section of the bill.  
He proposed an alternative. 
The wealthier person took in his friend. 
They have been sharing accommodation for years. 
They basically share everything in that household. 
The bill totally excludes that kind of relationship. 
This is from the same government that said it would not do so. 
That was the law.  
I am attempting not to purposely overstate this and not to be sensational. 
Is this how we serve our constituents? 
Does this serve the best interest of those who have put us here?  
In the whole process people are left out. 
We live in busy times. 
They will not notice all this.  
The vote today will very likely go unnoticed. 
In summary, the bill has three key strikes against it. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I imagine this figure applies to the past two parliaments. 
One has to wonder. 
This is how we want to proceed. 
This is what I call the tyranny of the majority. 
Unfortunately, this tyranny does not exist only in the House. 
We regularly experience it in the committees as well. 
In fact I would say that it is definitely in doubt. 
I find that absolutely deplorable.  
I also want to speak of the government's arrogance. 
There will be no discussion with you of sharing. 
We are taking it and we will see about it afterwards''. 
Job action is allowed in a democracy. 
When workers are dissatisfied, there are legal means of expressing their dissatisfaction. 
These are provided for in the Canada Labour Code. 
Striking is one of them, and job action is another. 
I give this example because it is particularly outrageous. 
That is totally unacceptable and that shows arrogance.  
I would say he hardly spoke more than 10 minutes. 
In 1996, he asked for consultations on the pension plan. 
But what did the President of the Treasury Board do? 
Exactly the opposite of what he said in 1996.  
What did the government do, in the end? 
Through the bill before us, it is grabbing whatever it feels like. 
The government is making off with $30 billion.  
This leads me to talk about the government's management practices. 
I have been listening to the finance minister. 
I feel that the finance minister is the Darth Vader of this House. 
I will explain why later. 
Let us look at how the government has been managing things these last few years. 
The government simply decided to cut transfers to the provinces. 
That is what they called the CHST.  
What happened was highly predictable. 
Welfare programs were also affected.  
The federal government was able to start reducing the deficit. 
A huge reform has taken place. 
As well, this fund is increasing by $6 billion or $7 billion every year. 
In the past some were excluded, for instance students with weekend jobs. 
The Liberals initially acknowledged the problem a little bit. 
Then they were told ``You have to pay these people''. 
This has been proven.  
The President of the Treasury Board kept trying to push back the deadline. 
These decisions were made public a long time ago. 
There is the problem of pay equity. 
Thirty billion dollars is not peanuts.  
The government is wondering. 
They do not have a say in anything. 
All this is very hard to accept.  
Who did the government decide to target? 
It is these people.  
The government had other options. 
It could have negotiated with its public service. 
It could have said ``We realize that there are surpluses. 
Perhaps we could try to improve the plan. 
However, this is not what the government did.  
I would also like to look at what this will mean. 
Some of my constituents are listening today. 
Members of the RCMP also live there.  
We are talking about regional economy. 
What will someone receiving $9,400 a year going to do with that amount? 
This is about all they can afford with $9,400.  
Now, imagine what would happen if the government decided to upgrade pensions. 
This is not peanuts. 
I thought it was important to share these facts with the House. 
Will Bill C-78 affect me? 
Earlier, we raised questions about the government's management practices. 
This is one more thing that affects Quebec directly.  
That strikes me as a pretty flagrant lack of fairness.  
This is also true for the procurement of goods and services. 
That is a lot.  
It is said that the rate of unemployment in Quebec is higher. 
I now wish to speak a bit about same sex spouses. 
Some members have expressed very interesting points of view. 
We saw this again last week. 
Decisions are recognizing these people increasingly.  
But the problem here is that the government is resolving things piecemeal. 
This is not the first matter resolved in such a fashion. 
The same thing is happening here. 
They are going to have to make a choice this evening.  
The government is taking a piecemeal approach, instead of resolving the fundamental issue. 
There could even be a free vote on this specific bill.  
However, for the time being, the government has decided not to use that approach. 
It is taking a piecemeal approach. 
I want to raise another point. 
Obviously, one can use statistics to support any position.  
It is an utter disgrace.  
They know that it is utterly unfair. 
The government is setting a precedent. 
It is going to send a message to employers, particularly those in the private sector. 
That is how this government, which makes laws and employs people, thinks. 
The House should consider what this will mean in the private sector.  
I am referring to Singer employees. 
This case was widely publicised. 
Almost half of the employees are now dead and their average age is 84. 
Yet people believe that the issue has been settled.  
The government decided otherwise. 
It allowed Singer to dip in the surplus. 
What was happening at the time? 
The federal public service pension funds were starting to generate a surplus. 
We, in the Bloc Quebecois, realize that the first victims were the Singer workers. 
But they were only the first victims, because there will be many more to come. 
You have to agree that this sets a precedent. 
Of course, we are also talking about federally regulated funds.  
That does not work. 
The banks tell me the same thing. 
Whose interests is this government defending? 
I think it is defending the interests of the banks, of insurance companies, of Bell. 
The Bloc Quebecois gets absolutely nothing. 
They can at last see the light at the end of the tunnel.  
For those corporate interests, billions of dollars in profit each year are never quite enough. 
They are quite willing to grab their employees' pension fund.  
I would like to come back to the financing of political parties. 
I will never have my hands tied by big multinationals. 
The Bloc Quebecois will never want to become the government. 
We do not have our hands tied.  
This is why we can say the sort of thing we are saying today. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
It should go for pension purposes for retired public servants in the country.  
I hear a Liberal member on the other side saying nonsense. 
They cannot spend it.  
A Liberal member is saying that they cannot spend it. 
This is very revealing. 
The government says the Canada pension is better indexed. 
That is a very revealing statement. 
I want to make three points. 
It is a very major step and a major initiative. 
However, that is not the case.  
That really is a tragedy and a shame in terms of our parliamentary democracy.  
All they can do is laugh at the plight of the pensioners.  
That is one point I wanted to make.  
We have discovered that there will not be any ethical screening of those investments. 
I think that is wrong.  
I would certainly support an amendment to that effect. 
I certainly support that thrust of the bill.  
That is very important. 
The member from Hamilton said ``They could not spend it anyway''. 
That has not happened.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
They just said ``Yes, we will pass it''.  
I was first elected in 1968. 
Of course, I was about 12 years old then. 
The House sat until the end of July. 
Of course that never happened. 
I will give an example of what I mean. 
There is no one across the way who can answer on behalf of the Senate. 
Some Canadians want the Senate to be abolished, some want it to be reformed. 
That is not part of the argument. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
I had been working with many groups trying to deal with and stop these cutbacks. 
Out of the mouths of babes come words of truth and wisdom. 
I think that is exactly what we are dealing with today. 
The government brings down the heavy instrument of closure, time allocation. 
I think the trend is clear and worrisome.  
I understand from some reports that closure was a very rarely used tool. 
This is nothing more than autocracy masquerading as democracy.  
The antiquated system no longer has the support of most Canadians.  
That does not make sense.  
Of course it does. 
Give me one quote.  
You guys are on the same side of the issue.  
I think it is the most comical of situations.  
Where were the NDP when we were listening to the concerns of people?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
There is nothing inconsistent about the NDP's position. 
It could have been carried to its logical conclusion. 
That is what we are doing today. 
We have always been there to participate every step of the way.  
Is it agreed that we proceed to Statements by Members?  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
More than just that, it has taken the program directly to students.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
On October 12 the world's population will reach six billion. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
This does not reflect the reality of the situation.  
So, today, why the silence of the ``blockers'', the friends of Lucien Bouchard?  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
The hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
The hon. member for Frontenac-Megantic.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
THE LATE OWEN HART 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
The Hart family is known worldwide as the first family of wrestling. 
He was an outstanding athlete and an inspiration for so many.  
Stu and Helen have been married for over 50 years. 
Owen was the youngest of their 12 children. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
The top winner in the broadcasting, radio and television program was Sarah Sherbourne of Waterloo. 
Sarah won or shared four of the 16 awards given out: the Q97.5FM 
Carla Donnell of Kitchener won the CHYM announcing award.  
THE LATE HUGH HANRAHAN 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He passed away in Edmonton on Wednesday, May 19.  
He taught with Edmonton Catholic schools for 20 years.  
Hugh also had a great pride in his Irish and Scottish roots. 
Hugh is survived by his wife Dianne, daughter Margaret Anne and four brothers. 
We would like the family to know that all of us are thinking of them.  
TASK FORCE ON FOUR WESTERN PROVINCES 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
The response to our meetings was overwhelming. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, today is National Missing Children's Day.  
Four out of five missing children are runaways. 
Most are running away from abusive situations.  
The Liberal government has abandoned these children. 
Programs like these identify and help troubled youth. 
Their loss leaves youth with nowhere to turn. 
It is no wonder so many are ending up on the streets. 
The lucky ones might end up begging for change or squeegeeing car windows. 
The unlucky ones fall victim to drugs or prostitution.  
Children are their helpless victims.  
It is time for a government that cares about children.  
QUEBEC TRADE MISSION TO MEXICO 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
The collaboration of the federal government ought to have been a given. 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Julie, allow us to share in your success. 
Your mission is a result of team effort. 
We will be watching you on Thursday, Julie. 
We are proud of you. 
Good luck Julie, and thank you for representing us so proudly.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Canada should not have pursued a disengagement policy. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
The family of Mr. Justice Weir donated the park. 
Today our O Canada remains one of the oldest national anthems in the world.  
Mr. Weir would be proud, as we all are. 
This was a work of love for the greatest country in the world.  
LEADER OF THE BLOC QUEBECOIS 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Colleagues, this is the very first question we have had. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Connaught Labs was the subsidiary of a subsidiary of the CDC. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
We want that cleared up.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
CDC owned Connaught 100%. 
There were major significant dealings going on in those days. 
For instance, Connaught lost the Red Cross licence in those days.  
Does the finance minister remember that tiny little detail?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
He was one of the individuals who made the decisions. 
Can he not understand that there could be a conflict of interest?  
Would he like to go over and get those documents from the Department of Industry? 
Will we get them?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
FUNERAL OF KING HUSSEIN 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He is able to speak for himself. 
He does not need anyone to tell him what to do.  
King Abdullah was here ten days ago and we discussed this matter. 
He was very happy to see the Minister of Foreign Affairs representing Canada.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is what is important.  
Does the bad example not come from the top?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I wanted to be there. 
I could not get there.  
I spoke with King Abdullah himself and he was very understanding. 
He was ready to answer questions from the press. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
General Baril assumed his responsibilities. 
He knew very well that I wanted to be there. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
This year it is an outright conviction.  
How long will the government tolerate this incompetence?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have received the report. 
Each year in office he has given us the report we asked for. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Is this government proud of its record? 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
This has operated for 34 years- 
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
What options did it consider before it brought in these harsh measures?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
The Supreme Court of Canada said no.  
What allows you to violate the high- 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are following a proper lawful process with respect to this expropriation. 
We did not want to go with this process. 
We used every opportunity to negotiate. 
It should not be linked to other issues. 
We should deal with it completely on its own merit. 
This is a vital defence facility.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Expropriation is the issue here. 
How does the government justify expropriation in this instance or any instance? 
I want to know what has changed since 1984. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
That is what we are talking about. 
We are talking about paying full market value, fair market value. 
We would not pay any less. 
They want to keep it open.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The hon. Minister of Finance, if he wants to answer.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am going to respond.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
That question is not in order.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Its approval is urgent''.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Everyone had been talking about it. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is the reason that explains the little delay. 
It was nothing like the kind of innuendo the Reform is trying to bring about.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question to the minister closely relates to his responsibilities and is very simple. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Did he take part in that decision made by cabinet? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, Mr. Fugere was not an aide. 
Second, the matter has been referred by the ethics councillor to the RCMP for investigation.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the question answered itself. 
We will see what the outcome of that investigation is.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are very rigorous managers.  
Members must always address the Chair.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment. 
Companies should not be allowed to release toxic substances into the environment. 
Will the minister crack down on companies that pollute our environment?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We wanted to use a targeted wage subsidy- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
It was requested and it was received.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Why will the minister not listen to the people of B.C.?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
That is absolutely illogical and the hon. member knows it.  
It does that as a deterrent, as a general policy. 
We have understood that for 34 years. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
What price will Canadian taxpayers suffer this time?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Is that the new way of negotiating with provincial governments?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I agree, Mr. Speaker, it is a very rare example. 
It is not something that we want to do. 
It would not negotiate.  
We offered a lot more than what this property is worth. 
We will follow the legal process. 
Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-East York, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for Children and Youth.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
That is a substantive contribution of $150 million.  
This should enhance the urban component of the strategy. 
The government used the latest data available to develop the resource allocation model.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
However, I realize that there are different points of view in different provinces. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have implemented a lot of measures to assist workers, precisely- 
The hon. member for Saint John.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, consultations are taking place. 
This is a proposal. 
It is now up for discussion. 
We know that we need to make some changes. 
SCIENCE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
In fact, it is less than 12%.  
They are chosen like any other individual. 
They go through the very same steps. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of the Environment. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
The Inuit find the housing conditions in Nunavik extremely distressing. 
They consider the situation totally intolerable. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a petition with over 1,000 signatories. 
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will be answering Question No. 169 today. 
Question No. 169- Mr. Garry Breitkreuz: 
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
I have his letter. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
To my knowledge none of the opposition parties received any information from the government. 
We have no idea what negotiations have gone on. 
I thank the hon. member for the explanation and for his letter. 
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
There was the wage freeze our public servants have dealt with under the government. 
There was the incredible level of layoffs.  
The legislation provides the mechanisms through which the government can access that $30 billion. 
It is basically just a paper transfer.  
It is simply not fair.  
There is some agreement that the government has a legal right to the surplus. 
The government is changing the rules.  
He faced an unfortunate demise off the side of his yacht. 
It used the offsetting interest income surplus to do that.  
The government has set a double standard. 
Over time we have seen job security disappear from the public service. 
The wages in many cases are now far below those of the private sector. 
They will be attracted to better paying jobs in the private sector.  
Our country needs a viable productive public service. 
They may not be as interested in the private sector. 
I am concerned about some of the elements the government is going about doing this.  
This is a brilliant opportunity. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague in the Conservative Party for his comments.  
Minimum wage is very low in New Brunswick. 
How can we try to create jobs in our region?  
The government found a way to get $30 billion. 
It is a lot of money.  
This money is being taken. 
The government has found two pots. 
This is directly affecting the public service employees.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the New Democratic Party for her question.  
As a result, 70% of that is an EI tax. 
That is absolutely unacceptable in a very competitive global environment.  
I am afraid that in this case that is the case. 
Because it is the government and it does not respect the parliamentary process.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
In the long term, that will maximize the return for public servants. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
I want to make it clear that this is absolutely false. 
Public service pension benefits are protected and guaranteed by law. 
Nothing in the bill will or can diminish those benefits. 
This new formula will produce a somewhat smaller reduction in benefits at that point. 
This is clearly unfair to those other persons whose benefits are affected.  
Their benefits are defined and guaranteed in law and will in no way be diminished. 
The proposed amendments will leave their future benefits safe and intact. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Why are civil servants worried? 
Why are they making all kinds of threats beyond that?  
I would like to know which one it is.  
I do not know what could be clearer than that. 
The moneys are there by law. 
If there is a shortfall it will covered. 
That has been the case all along and will continue to be so.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
One way or another the taxpayer is going to be funding this. 
Whose money is it? 
Who is going to get this money? 
Who are the Liberals actually trying to protect? 
One would assume then that there is a significant surplus. 
It has been pointed out by the actuary. 
In whose interest is it? 
In both cases the moneys are there. 
This is something we accept in this society.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
That came up during second reading and I saw the word conjugal. 
I know a little bit about words. 
It is from two Latin words involving togetherness and yoking together. 
That is what it means explicitly. 
It has not changed. 
Go to any dictionary including Black's dictionary. 
Everywhere you go you can look it up and find that, Mr. Speaker. 
I was led to the 1997 Rosenberg court case. 
There are three ideas here: opposite sex, cohabits and conjugal relationship. 
I looked at all the cases presented for me. 
What do we have? 
the person is considered to be the survivor of the contributor.  
The legislation actually fails to achieve what it was designed to achieve.  
I submit that the supreme court judges have made the same error. 
It belongs to parliamentarians to make those changes.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am overwhelmed by the approach of this member. 
I commend him for that, but he leaves me with a number of unanswered questions.  
It does refer, though, to the sexual activity within a married relationship generally.  
That has been not dealt with. 
I am as concerned as he is that is where this will be decided.  
I just wonder what he thinks the outcome will be in the courts. 
What does the member think will be the outcome when this hits the courtroom?  
The courts have not ruled on the definition of conjugal.  
We can leave sex out of it entirely as far as I am concerned.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I would like him to clarify that.  
Mr. Speaker, I would say both. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Lethbridge.  
The bill has become infamous on two counts. 
Second, it lets the courts decide the definition of marriage. 
It will allow pension benefits to be delivered based on conjugal relationships.  
The greed on the other side of the House is disgusting to watch. 
That is not the case.  
The word the union is using is stealing. 
It is a very serious charge.  
The six-year wage freeze has reduced the liability of the plan. 
This is the sort of government we have. 
We have a finance minister who cooks the books. 
Let us look at the history of the $30 billion grab. 
The committee carried on consultations for four years. 
It will allow marriage to be redefined and unfairly exclude others. 
The change in the definition of marriage should not be left up to the courts. 
Rather, the definition should be based on a relationship of dependency and companionship. 
Who will manage the board? 
That is a big question.  
The appointment process will be similar to the one used for the Senate. 
He will boast that he is a hero, but he will actually be a zero. 
There would be a great deal of consultation between the stakeholders and the government.  
There should have been enough time allocated for debate to take place in the House. 
Shame on the Liberals.  
The letter further states: 
Leave my pension fund where it is- 
The letter concludes by stating: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is all one and the same.  
The pension plan is guaranteed. 
It is a legislated plan. 
Their 7.5% is guaranteed. 
Their pension is guaranteed.  
The hon. member opposite should understand what this legislation is all about. 
That is quite evident on the other side of the House. 
I prepare my speeches and I work hard. 
This money belongs to the pension fund of the employees.  
I have received many letters from my constituents who are worried about their pensions. 
Who covered that shortfall? 
Is this not another tax? 
Is that how the hon. member thinks the government should balance the budget? 
It has already balanced the budget on the backs of the taxpayers.  
It brags that it is injecting $11 billion. 
Does it not remember that it cut $20 billion in the first place? 
Those are the mathematics the government is using.  
Voters do not have short memories. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
They do not like it and they are not going to support it.  
It should be interesting later on when we vote on this.  
There is the fact that inflation has been low. 
There are three critical areas. 
Public servants had their wages frozen. 
That is what this has turned into. 
They have not been pension contributions. 
They have not been EI premiums. 
It is a tax and it should be called that. 
The government forgets that this money belongs to the taxpayers and the employees.  
The courts in the last little while have been creating laws. 
That is our job. 
That is why people voted for us. 
That is why we are here, to legislate. 
This is where the problem exists. 
There was some representation from each of the affected funds. 
That concern should not be there. 
The pensioners who are coming forward are very concerned with this. 
That is not why we were elected by our constituents.  
We oppose this bill. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to enter into this debate. 
I want to take this opportunity to say how miffed I am. 
Is miffed a parliamentary word, because I am miffed. 
I am not even permitted to give my speech. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Elk Island for his question.  
It is a breach of the trust that Canadians have in this House.  
We have to have the support and the backing of our constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, I sit on the environment committee. 
I am here to represent the constituents of Lethbridge. 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
What does the integration mean? 
To this point I have discussed only employee contribution rates. 
More recently that distribution has shifted rather dramatically.  
Now they will have to pay them like all the rest of us.  
Maybe possibly but not necessarily. 
That is important to note.  
The employer would continue to assume the larger share.  
However, any necessary increases would be gradual. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have my own hoist motion in process as we speak. 
However I would like to deal with the controversial section concerning survivor benefits.  
One feels a little like treading into an area where angels fear to tread. 
It is quite obvious there was a very divided court. 
The court shouldn't be deciding it. 
In my view that effectively shuts out the voice of the people of Canada. 
This constitutes a complete abdication of our responsibility as parliamentarians. 
In my view this is back door legislation through regulation. 
This is essentially an issue of jurisdictional competency. 
Only parliament can reflect on the wishes of its constituents.  
I am told that there is omnibus legislation on the way. 
This is quite curious. 
My view on same sex benefits is quite irrelevant. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I was listening very carefully to what the member was saying. 
That was democracy at work. 
It was just not going to do it. 
Members would vote against it or they would stay away.  
I think at this point the legislation is premature. 
The drafting of a bill is a little like a tree. 
Once one makes one decision then several other logical decisions follow. 
If another decision is made several other logical conclusions follow.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member's speech and his answer is a reasonable one. 
I would like to ask a very short question. 
That is just simply a reality of politics in the Chamber.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Frontenac-Megantic.  
Obviously the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill.  
A draft version of the bill had previously been introduced. 
The elderly have always reacted strongly.  
Let us not forget that 1999 is the International Year of the Elderly. 
Moreover, this week is Senior Citizens' Week. 
Retired women, who often form the majority, are sometimes and even often the poorest.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
However, I would like his opinion. 
Would this not be just what private businesses were waiting for? 
The member for Laval East mentions the Singer company. 
The company has been dragging the process out before the courts. 
When the example comes from higher up we follow it generally.  
This government has always arranged things so as to be able to take pension money. 
I fear that some companies will do as he mentioned and imitate the government.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois for his comments.  
The surplus amounted to $25 billion. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to have to interrupt the hon. member.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I am looking at the figures here. 
It is no longer $30 billion, but close to $33 billion.  
Where does this surplus come from? 
Adding all this up, it comes to a surplus of $30.2 billion. 
Those were the figures as at March 31, 1998, just about 20 months ago. 
With the projection, I would suggest that the figure would now be $33 billion.  
He is getting ready to deliberately get his hands on this money. 
The current outlay is $3.1 billion. 
This means that the interest alone provides enough money to pay the pensions to retirees. 
It is worth doing the calculating.  
What will he do with that money? 
Perhaps he will do like the government did with the employment insurance surplus. 
It is truly scandalous.  
I am sure members will remember Singer sewing machines. 
When I was young, my mother always had a Singer.  
His name is Charles Lacroix. 
Year after year, he paid into the pension fund.  
The matter of the employees' pension fund has not been settled yet. 
The matter of the pension fund is still before the courts. 
Does it not sound like Singer, though not as bad? 
The ball is in the government's court; it is wilfully delaying any settlement. 
The matter has been before the courts for I do not know how many years. 
The matter is before the courts, to the delight of the lawyers. 
This is what is going on. 
Unfortunately, it is always the most vulnerable members of society who foot the bill.  
This is exactly what is going on with the employment insurance. 
Doug Young learned his lesson on June 2, 1997. 
This does not mean Doug Young is unemployed. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his clear presentation. 
It is always interesting to listen to him. 
His comments always carry a very political dimension. 
I am a great admirer of the hon. member for Frontenac-Megantic.  
He referred to the Singer workers. 
People think that the case of Singer workers was settled. 
But there is still an outstanding issue. 
In 1994, the Bloc Quebecois began asking questions. 
The various ministers kept saying that the issue did not come under their responsibility. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, you were in this House. 
Here we are in 1999, and it is still not settled. 
It is now May 25.  
Do you know what the President of Treasury Board wants? 
He wants to set up a board with friends of the regime. 
But what sort of board will it be? 
One made up of cronies of the regime, of course.  
Jacques Roy, fortunately, set the matter straight. 
In a few years, she will talk about a ``small deportation''. 
It is exactly the same thing. 
The minister said ``It was some time in the 17th century''. 
She is out by a century. 
Fortunately, Jacques Roy was there to set things straight.  
She is entitled, while she questions me.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Everyone in Acadia knows that.  
It was the same thing with Doug Young, as my hon. colleague indicated. 
Perhaps we will resolve that on June 7 as well.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
She has not represented us well, she does not deserve her position. 
She must be dismissed immediately. 
Hats off to Jacques Roy, who set things straight. 
Fortunately he was there.  
The bill also contains provisions to ensure that it is an effective operation.  
The provisions of the bill show us that such is not the case. 
These committees are comprised of representatives of employees and retired employees. 
The bill also contains provisions pertaining to the management of the plans. 
Many newspapers have also indicated their support for the government's position.  
The government remains open to that possibility.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
A number of people are really concerned about this bill. 
I would like to know how the member reconciles the difference. 
There is a botch-up here somewhere.  
As we discussed earlier, it is a legislated plan. 
The Reform Party does not like that. 
Why do they not like it? 
Why does the Reform Party not like that? 
Why does the Reform Party not like that? 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The parliamentary secretary is trying to put words in my mouth. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a point of debate.  
Mr. Speaker, there is not much they can speak about. 
It is all on the record. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, I have to interrupt because we have another question.  
Mr. Speaker, we know this is a fixed benefit plan.  
He says that we get up and regurgitate. 
The Liberals have said this in every speech they have handed out to their people. 
I want him to know that I very seldom use notes. 
I have never ever used a speech that someone else has written.  
My real question is on the pension issue. 
There is a surplus. 
Quite clearly there is a $30 billion surplus. 
When he says that Reform has a problem with that, he is wrong.  
How about the contributions made by the employees? 
They have also been overcharged. 
That is part of the difficulty he is facing. 
That is what brings us to the point of dealing with this piece of legislation.  
That is what we are facing.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order with regard to Bill C-78. 
I quote clause 96, subsection 44.4(2)(b):  
The public service of Canada is currently comprised of around 300,000 employees. 
It is therefore a charge upon the people.  
Instead, they are pension plans that are legislated by parliament. 
Legally there is no employer-employee contractual relationship.  
He said at 5.20 p.m.: 
Mr. Speaker, in your ruling of December 2, 1998 you said: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This will be on the record and the Speaker will make a ruling.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just want to make a few points for the record.  
Again this is a dilatory measure that the Reform Party is trying. 
I request that we proceed with the vote as scheduled.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will consult with the clerks and will have a ruling forthwith.  
I hope that is taken into consideration.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We should not get into any more debate.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
It is another attack against workers in this country.  
It is significant not only for the public service pension funds. 
I believe the government has the responsibility to show the way. 
What it is saying to private companies is ``Look. 
This is exactly what bill C-78 is doing.  
I say that it is unacceptable and that Canadians will not stand for it. 
The government has gone after those who have lost their jobs. 
Now, it is going after future retirees.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
He said it is a dangerous, destructive bill.  
It is in the legislation now. 
It is already there and it has not caused any difficulty in interpretation whatsoever.  
We shared everything as life partners. 
We were emotionally and financially interdependent. 
Every aspect of our lives was connected, inter-related. 
We shared in the parenting of two children. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Speaker and the clerks are in consultation as we speak.  
The question is on third reading of Bill C-78. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
Consequently I cannot agree with the hon. member for St. Albert. 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried. 
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL PURPOSES 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
The question is on the amendment to the amendment.  
I declare the amendment to the amendment defeated.  
The next question is on the amendment.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment carried.  
The next question is on the main motion, as amended.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Member is out of order.  
I declare the motion, as amended, carried.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
There is one more date of note. 
On June 26, 1986 the Treasury Board began the process of replacing the Sea Kings. 
Almost 13 years have passed since then, 13 years.  
The government must answer three questions. 
Third, what month will the replacement helicopters be operational?  
They are the heroes in this tragedy of errors wrought by the government.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
This is a must, and there will be no compromise on this point.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
They do not make very much money doing this.  
There are indications that the groundfish breed out there as well. 
We cannot do a proper assessment in six months. 
There are a lot of indications from the fishermen that indeed they do. 
The DFO spends very little money on science in this regard.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He mentioned about being cautious. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
The margin of safety has been jeopardized. 
This report lists only two possible solutions to the problem. 
The inspector identified it and the manager confirmed it.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.54 p.m.)
