CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD-SPEAKER'S RULING 
I think it may be useful to review the sequence of events on this matter.  
The House is a forum for debate and the consideration of different points of view. 
Members do not work in a vacuum. 
I thank hon. members for their contributions to this discussion.

Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Your committee has agreed to report it with one amendment.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all the questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
ALLOTTED DAY-GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ): moved: 
Why did I move this motion? 
We have nothing against equalization, on the contrary. 
But this is a completely different matter.  
Quebeckers were stunned to see him do that.  
How did the federal government achieve this result? 
Simply by devising a formula designed to favour the maritimes. 
So, everyone in Quebec and all the provincial premiers support it. 
This is an extremely important issue. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Quebec did what it had to and harmonized its sales tax. 
It did so without any financial assistance. 
There were of course considerable financial costs involved. 
For these corporations, this represents additional costs totalling $500 million annually.  
Questions are being raised concerning this financial compensation program. 
We have had support from various sources. 
To this day, the minister has turned a deaf ear to this request. 
He insists his numbers are accurate and says that he has taken the right decision. 
I would even go so far as to amend the motion. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
The harmonization of the GST is a positive thing economically. 
I will give one example. 
The Quebec economy has received great economic advantage for doing that early.  
Madam Speaker, the member is right on one thing: we had a vision. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
When comparing things, one should do it properly. 
Let the government submit its data and let the committee look at them impartially.  
In any case, consumers would have been very unhappy.  
However, we demonstrated a lot of wisdom.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The amendment proposed by the member for Louis-Hebert is in order.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Quebec acted in a very practical manner.  
With today's motion, the Bloc is again shooting blanks. 
The trigger level has been set at 5% for two reasons.  
They did not drop. 
Even the Quebec government public accounts confirm this.  
That has nothing to do with the sales tax.  
Elimination of other irregularities would bring the estimated amount to zero. 
That is the only role of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask a question to the Liberal member. 
That is my first remark.  
I have a second one. 
I would like him to explain this to me.  
Madam Speaker, it is obvious. 
We openly and on several occasions provided the details of our program. 
The figures were openly discussed with Quebec officials.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
I would like to ask a question to the minister who just spoke. 
In fact, I put this question to Quebecers:
I would like him to answer that.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I must tell members that our party will be standing in opposition.  
I want to make my argument on three different tracks.  
I think it is euphemistic to call it compensation. 
It is wrong to offer it to Quebec. 
Finally, we should point out that Quebec entered into this deal willingly. 
It asserted its independence and made this deal quite willingly in 1991.  
I want to expand on those points. 
The first thing is was the money that was paid to Atlantic Canada really compensation? 
We should ask ourselves how this all came to pass. 
We all know about the sorry episode that followed thereafter. 
She was eventually demoted. 
She lost her job as the deputy prime minister. 
It was a sorry episode in the history of the Liberal Party.  
Where do my friends in the Bloc think that comes from, that billion dollars? 
It does not just come from the mint. 
We do not just print it. 
We absolutely disagree with the premise.  
We argue that the money is much better left in the hands of taxpayers. 
It is certainly a big issue today. 
We say let us remember where that money is coming from.  
They did make their own deal. 
They cannot have it both ways. 
What about employment insurance? 
They are simply asking too much.  
Canadians simply cannot afford it. 
Ontario would want $3 billion and on and on it would go.  
Where is this money supposed to come from? 
Where does it come from? 
It comes from the pockets of ordinary Canadians. 
It is absolutely ridiculous.  
Second, let us remember that two wrongs do not make a right. 
Two wrongs do not make a right. 
They made that decision in 1991 and rushed headlong in. 
They undoubtedly will enjoy the benefits of harmonization. 
They claim they already have. 
I do not think we will hear that.  
Let me conclude by saying that Reformers will be voting against this motion. 
We think it is a foolhardy motion. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
He also asked where the money was coming from.  
We have in this country a program of equalization payments. 
As a nation we want to build a dynamic economy. 
It reduced taxes and allowed more disposable income in the hands of Atlantic Canadians. 
Can they not see that?  
It is absolutely ridiculous.  
Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon, Lib.):
I am a bit disturbed by the tone of the debate.  
That is a rule of the House.  
Some areas are more productive than others. 
Second, he talked about the surplus and a tax dividend. 
Are they not the best places to put our funds?  
That does not rule out equalization. 
Our party agrees with equalization. 
We do not happen to think that three provinces should support seven.  
We should also pay attention to outcomes. 
Most of them cannot find one today.  
Only 13% want to see some spending. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Madam Speaker, in Quebec we have a beautiful motto, Je me souviens . 
We are not able to stand up. 
We have here a clear demonstration of how much they love us.  
Here is my question to the hon. member. 
So let us go then; we want to go away. 
We have the highest tax rates in the G-7. 
Let us leave money in their pockets.  
I would like your advice on this matter.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In the meanwhile, we will resume debate. 
The hon. member for Kamloops has the floor.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
It does not make any difference. 
Obviously it is a very regressive tax.  
Harmonize is a good word. 
The harmonized tax was to blend provincial and federal taxes.  
It said that this was a great idea. 
I never understood it. 
The short and long of it is that taxpayers will pay more.  
Let us refer to someone other than the New Democratic Party of Canada. 
What about the dominion bond rating agencies? 
I will read two or three of the summary comments. 
They stated that there would be a net revenue loss for the provinces. 
That is not surprising. 
That is what everybody predicted. 
They stated that consumers would not benefit. 
The analysis of the dominion bond rating agencies goes on for pages and pages. 
I could quote it until the time I have for my presentation runs out. 
They said there were two losers: provincial governments and consumers. 
Who benefits from it? 
It must have had its reasons.  
What about the Atlantic provinces? 
The Atlantic premiers thought they would lose money. 
The premiers could probably be bought off for a billion dollars. 
The evidence was mounting by the day. 
Indeed it is not a part of it to this day. 
Now there is a Conservative Premier of Prince Edward Island. 
The people of Prince Edward Island know what it will do to them.  
What will it do? 
We went to all the capital cities. 
We talked to people about the economic and fiscal situation of Canada. 
It means necessities have to be abandoned.  
That was the kind of theme I was trying to develop. 
I even have to pay a tax on my Bible''.  
She asked me to explain why we were doing this to her. 
I could not explain. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for this extension. 
I will conclude my remarks quickly.  
People knew that our tax system was unjust, unfair and biased. 
There is no question about that. 
Look in this morning's paper. 
These seminars are being held in the capital city. 
It penalizes the working poor, the jobless and the victims of an economic downturn. 
They are punished and treated more cruelly under this blended sales tax.  
I look at my friends across the way in the Liberal Party. 
They need it simply to live.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
I do hope he was not talking on behalf of his party. 
I do hope this is not the final position of his party. 
On the other hand, the Atlantic provinces harmonize their tax and are compensated. 
Madam Speaker, my friend makes a very convincing argument. 
First, I do speak for my party. 
No, we do not think it is fair. 
There was an unfairness. 
However, he used the term compensation, which is a fair term. 
I use the term bribe. 
I do believe that the provinces in Atlantic Canada were bribed quite frankly. 
My friend's point is well taken. 
There was an injustice. 
Yes some provinces were treated differently from other provinces. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
The reality is that it had been implemented.  
The member talked about being on the finance committee. 
I did that trip. 
Only we were talking about a harmonized tax at the time. 
The small and medium sized business people said resoundingly ``Harmonize the tax. 
We are dealing with two administrations here. 
The bureaucratic overlap and duplication for small businesses is inefficient''. 
Having said that, it is not just Canada. 
All these countries have moved toward a consumption tax.  
Why would the NDP members not argue for a more targeted tax cut? 
Why do they want to reduce a retrogressive tax?  
Madam Speaker, my friend's question is a very valid one. 
As we get into a more fiscally realistic era it would make sense.  
Tax cuts obviously will become a reality one day. 
We simply cannot afford that as a country at this point. 
Therefore, a phase down to us makes more sense.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
In retrospect Quebec thinks it should be compensated. 
However it is not the only province that will not receive compensation upon harmonization. 
Ontario will not, Alberta will not and also B.C. will not. 
These provinces pay substantially to those provinces that are being compensated.  
The Liberal red book itself was much more vague however. 
The Liberals used to think the GST was not visible enough. 
Why has he not honoured these promises? 
It was a well thought out plan on the part of the Tory government. 
It was no surprise that all governments involved were Liberals. 
Those living in the three Atlantic provinces have been hardest hit. 
The HST attacks low and low middle income Canadians the most. 
Examples would be cars, stereos, home appliances and boats.  
Those provinces are receiving more than twice the money of their anticipated shortfall. 
All this money was paid up front. 
We have heard from the provinces. 
The auditor general has slammed this accounting trick.  
The Liberal government has broken its promises over and over again. 
The GST is still here. 
The red book promised a tax system that minimizes disruption to small businesses. 
This is both another cost to business and yet another barrier to interprovincial trade.  
They have done a patch-up job to meet their election objectives. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Sounds preposterous doesn't it? 
The truth is we are just inches away. 
We pay GST for getting our hair cut. 
I cannot stop my hair from growing.  
Everybody has to get a hair cut. 
Everybody has to buy clothing and books for children. 
He should have finished that. 
When you spend the money it stimulates the economy and it creates jobs. 
That is the whole point.  
The GST is a tax on jobs. 
It is a tax on the economy. 
That is why it is regressive. 
Furthermore it drives a massive underground economy. 
I am going to do that for cash''. 
Furthermore, the GST is a massive burden on small business. 
The compliance and administrative costs of operating the GST are extremely high. 
It makes perfect sense. 
Why can the government not see that?  
Madam Speaker, I do not know if I am to respond to that.  
The GST has been politicized too much. 
Maybe there are some items that should not be included.  
The tax is not included in goods that go out of the country. 
The GST has not been all that bad for us.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
How did the government come up with such a compensation for these three provinces? 
This is how it was calculated. 
That agreement gave them three benefits straight away. 
That was a direct advantage for the consumers in the three Atlantic provinces concerned.  
Quebec was not able to benefit from these three advantages. 
One must look at the whole tax base. 
One must do that. 
One must look at all the facts in this matter.  
I will give two examples. 
The third fundamental point is the one I made when I started to speak. 
It is 10% of the Quebec sales tax revenues.  
The federal government must be consistent. 
There are huge differences between Canadian provinces.  
We are not calling for a debate for the sheer pleasure of it. 
What we are calling for in our motion is something quite simple.  
We have figures and arguments. 
We think they are the best arguments. 
We think we have a strong case. 
All these people cannot be wrong. 
But we are prepared to play by the rules and take this approach. 
The Minister of Finance tells us ``You are not entitled to compensation''. 
Maybe our case is not as strong as all that.  
This is a useless debate.  
We are ready to accept the conclusion. 
All that is left to do is to settle the account.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
It is their problem.  
In Quebec, we went ahead with harmonization, without any federal support. 
Harmonizing both taxes is a good thing. 
We believe it is. 
We support efficiency, and the federal government knows it. 
You talked about Frank McKenna and rightly so. 
Frank McKenna tried to steal our own businesses. 
This is what the federal government calls a fair system. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I listened this morning to the debate about taxes and fairness. 
I had this come home to me the other day. 
These people were even taxed in death. 
Canadians are used to taxes.  
Smokers out there had to pay the full shot.  
Clearly, in a ideal world nobody would pay any tax. 
But, I would like to bring him back to earth. 
Unfortunately, we have to live with that. 
As you said, even death is taxed. 
It will take a while before that changes.  
In an ideal world nobody would smoke.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
We believe that this is really unfair. 
This should not be too hard to understand. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The committee heard from tax experts, business people and Canadians. 
In fact the committee heard from nearly 500 witnesses and received over 700 briefs. 
Consumers in participating provinces are benefiting in a number of important ways. 
Most important, there has been a reduction in the rate of tax. 
In Newfoundland and Labrador the rate decrease is closer to 5%.  
We heard a lot about businesses this morning in the first round. 
Businesses are also benefiting from the lower combined tax rate. 
It will end after four years. 
It is also important to note that it is truly a joint program. 
This mindset essentially ignores history. 
It misreads the present and quite frankly it lacks the vision for the future. 
I could go on and on. 
The list is long and quite honourable.  
These government investments respond to opportunities. 
Equalization payments are an essential part of our constitutional framework. 
Now they are being compensated for the elimination of the Crow rate.  
These actions were not charity. 
They were not partisan politics. 
That takes me to the present. 
More important, they are future killers and they are hope destroyers.  
It is a 21st century type of investment. 
I cannot make it much clearer than that. 
It is pretty straightforward. 
After four years it is on its own. 
It is a transitional measure.  
Let us go directly to the heart of today's motion by the Bloc. 
These figures are not based on my documents. 
They are not based on the documents of the national government. 
They are based on Quebec documents.  
I can go further. 
Quebec's revenues went up after harmonization.  
That was the message from St. Andrews.  
Let me clarify what the premiers said in St. Andrews. 
What they said is that all provinces should be treated equally. 
Let me go to another fact. 
I cannot make it any clearer than that. 
Harmonization occurred and revenues went up. 
Any linkage to that is truly false.  
That was not a prescription. 
It is a comment we cannot agree with.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
That is what he is doing now. 
This was demonstrated to him earlier. 
The member should ask his finance minister. 
What is he afraid of? 
What does he fear if his case is so strong? 
He should submit this case to the committee of experts.  
I want to make a last brief comment. 
So this is no reference.  
Mr. Speaker, once again the manipulation of information is becoming an art form.  
Quebec revenues went up after harmonization. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I have a couple of questions. 
He spoke about the foundation of the HST. 
The hon. member made a lot of suggestions about partisan politics. 
We listened to a certain amount of Liberal propaganda. 
Does he understand the commands gee and haw or droite and gauche? 
Therefore the horse listens to the commands. 
If the blinders are taken off the commands do not seem quite as specific.  
The tax is not revenue neutral. 
It gathers more tax than the two combined taxes used to gather. 
What is the government prepared to do about that?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will put those comments aside and try to deal with the facts.  
His statement is incorrect. 
The provinces Atlantic Canada because of harmonization are earning less government revenues.  
That is why they are receiving assistance.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
He said that high taxes were killing jobs. 
It was great to hear that from across the House. 
We have been saying that for a long time and we know it. 
They still resent having to be a tax collector for the government.  
Was a question put to them on whether they wanted a tax at all? 
Was that ever raised? 
They were to have harmonized taxes. 
Did they want two taxes or one tax? 
It is coming out of the pockets of families and businesses. 
The emphasis should be on putting the money back.  
You have commented on the consensus and I want you to elaborate on that- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It tends to keep the level of debate more controllable.  
If they are earning less than $30,000 they are exempt. 
Again this speaks to the reduction in the burden of compliance.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Quebec businesses bore the financial costs of this reform.  
I would like to quote Minister Bernard Landry: 
I will quote again Minister Bernard Landry: 
The compensation requested by the Government of Quebec is very reasonable. 
I sometimes wonder if the minister still remembers that rule. 
And the Liberal government dares to talk about a humane approach to finance. 
Once again, he sits tight and Quebec pays.  
Because we are unique. 
There are many examples of the Liberal government's bad faith. 
Their centralizing tactics pervade their every action. 
It is all a numbers game. 
The federal government seems to have trouble understanding what Quebec is going through. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think it is all very clear. 
Then there was the referendum.  
It is our tax money.  
Mr. Speaker, that is true. 
It is very simple.  
I have a question for the member. 
It is very simple. 
Yesterday, the Minister of Health was saying that things were clogged up. 
They have great difficulty understanding what they are being told.  
Their ears are blocked up.  
But I am convinced Quebec is the one that is right.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. chief government whip on a point of order.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
ALLOTTED DAY-GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):
The motion of the member for Mercier says, among other things: 
Let us look at the figures.  
I mentioned economic development earlier. 
Indeed, once again, Quebec is dealt with very fairly and equitably.  
This all began in 1995. 
People wanted us to revamp all our programming. 
Here are some examples of this flexibility. 
Members will recall the problem of the dwindling groundfish stocks in Atlantic Canada. 
We intervened, along with all the other federal departments that were called in. 
We left partisan politics behind, something the Bloc is incapable of doing.  
Tell us about the GST.  
This is why you are not inviting us.  
You see, they are yelling. 
This is yet another good example of co-operation.  
What a great program that has demonstrated its value locally for close to 20 years. 
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
They are in Abitibi also, as my colleague just mentioned. 
So we can see that these people are active locally. 
These people carry out business with the local community. 
Let me just mention the CFDCs youth initiative. 
This is essential because of globalization. 
I have two minutes left. 
This is a positive vision that can help Quebec. 
The purpose of so doing is, of course, to serve.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
The minister has just accused us of partisan politics. 
Fortunately, this sort of tactic does not work particularly well. 
I invite them to do so. 
We would like to hear what they have to say on the subject.  
What is this 5% based on, if it is not arbitrary? 
Where does the figure 5 come from and how can he justify it?  
This is his sort of reasoning. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I was not here this morning. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And they are complaining about unfair treatment.  
We must not be using the same dictionary. 
In terms of involvement in economic development- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
This is the reality.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I would like to ask the hon. parliamentary secretary how he justifies that comment?  
Harmonization has been well received by all the provinces across Canada. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
What Canadians need generally is tax relief. 
The government's tax record is record taxes. 
We were a little skeptical. 
Well there was a war, it was a war on Canadian taxpayers. 
The government should hang its head in shame.  
Those Canadians in those focus groups said they thought the GST was an atrocity. 
They thought it ought to be abolished. 
My question to my hon. friends opposite is, what are they afraid of? 
What are they trying to hide?  
It is really shocking. 
The government thinks that is greedy.  
The government assumes that Canadians would be opposed to tax relief. 
The priorities of Canadians are becoming increasingly evident. 
Canadians are calling for tax relief. 
They are calling for integrity in government. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
You are going to agree with him, too. 
You are a few sandwiches short, too. 
The arrogance of the Liberal Party of Canada never ceases to amaze me.  
I was a young Canadian concerned about no economic future. 
I had had it. 
Too many Canadians are going south of the border because of this tax burden. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
My PC friends groan whenever the name is mentioned. 
That government raised taxes 71 times in nine years. 
However after the CPP it will be 37 times. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It being close to 2 o'clock, we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Others are also involved. 
Supporting the Foodgrains Bank is truly a co-operative effort.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
The government promotes itself on gender equity. 
Perhaps it is time to rethink its definition of equal. 
Fairness across the board is the only way.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):

Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):

Because after 15 years of use, these reactors are no longer safe. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):

To you from failing hands we throw 
The torch; be yours to hold it high.

Mr. Speaker, another scandal has rocked the beautiful Quebec City area.

Once again, the colonized separatists are acting like colonials.

Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
The poem In Flanders Fields will be read often on November 11. 
In Flanders Fields was written by Guelph native John McCrae. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, government members profess to be the great guardians of the environment. 
Greener than grass they are. 
They are going to save the planet at Kyoto.  
Why does the government violate its own environmental standards?  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The hon. member might be interested in AECL's position. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is emitting a cloud of confusion. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There are two of them, the government operates with such a double standard.  
The government waives its own laws for the China Candu reactors. 
Then what do government members do? 
They turn around and make the same kind of bargains with Turkey. 
They just do not get it.  
Where is the proof?  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That is all there is to it.  
It has one law for Canada and another law for other countries in the world. 
Frankly we are sick and tired of this double law.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Does he have a letter of support from the Quebec government, yes or no? 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have difficulty understanding feigned outrage.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is not a lie. 
Colleagues, I thought I heard a word. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
That information is not correct. 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is mistaken. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Does the minister deny that- 
The hon. minister of multiculturalism.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on the contrary. 
The provinces may make additional requests. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, as usual the minister is showing himself badly informed. 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The government of Canada is following all applicable rules and regulations. 
We are confident of our position. 
Some others have proceeded with a court proceeding. 
We will see the results of that court proceeding in due course.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
How can it say that?  
In all these transactions we have followed the rules that we believe to be applicable. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Speaker, I have said this before and I will repeat it. 
As the hon. member will know, those standards are very stringent.  
The hon. member for Quebec. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
The answer is no.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
What possible legal and constitutional reason does the government have- 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the position of the Constitution is very clear. 
We intend to abide by the Constitution.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister knows better than that. 
Albertans are sick and tired. 
They have made this clear numerous times. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister responsible for the Coast Guard.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
He intends to take our arguments into account.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
It makes one wonder how shaky his other predictions are.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no change in the premiums. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have received the conciliation commissioner's report. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his very important question.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
They did not get a pay raise. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It was over a year ago that this performance pay was allowed. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
What he is saying is 100% pure balderdash. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
He does not know. 
It was also provided for the people in the Canadian forces. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the minister of defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there has been no determination as to when the announcement will be made. 
No decision has yet been made.  
It will be a more modest version of a helicopter. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
It concerns the upcoming APEC summit.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There has been no such decision by any international court under any international law.  
SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I heard the word helicopter so I jumped up. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Does he think Canadians are not paying attention?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we do not fly dangerous helicopters. 
We are going to get good value for the Canadian taxpayer. 
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
They demand a share in the economic benefits of this knowledge based society.  
My question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
This week they are saying that the prisons are too cushy. 
I wonder which wild rose the hon. member has been smelling lately.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
The federal government has indicated that it intends to withdraw from social housing. 
At the present time, the federal government is spending about $2 billion on housing. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
This issue has been of serious concern for years but has been too often ignored.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
These helicopters would have paid for themselves.  
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
That is something we are insisting upon in the bidding process. 
We want jobs created in this country.  
I cordially invite all of you to come and meet nos invites distingues.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
That party used two different questions to two different ministers. 
I always welcome innovative things in this House. 
The answer to your question directly is yes.  
MEMBER FOR MEDICINE HAT 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I think that will warm the hearts of both caucuses.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House of the following: 
Therefore, the first vote will be taken on Tuesday, November 18.  
On November 18, we will consider Bill C-11 on customs duties. 
I believe there is unanimous agreement to revert to Statements by Ministers.  
The war to end all wars was over. 
And whatever the war, whatever the campaign, endure they did.  
Nor have our peacekeepers been immune from death and terrible wounds. 
But they are just numbers on a page. 
They do not tell the human tragedy behind each and every loss.  
The words speak for themselves.  
A blow will be struck tomorrow which will definitely mark the turn of the tide- 
I have no misgivings for myself in tomorrow's encounter. 
It does not matter whether I survive or fall. 
We shall strive only to achieve victory. 
We shall not hold our lives dear. 
I trust to be as faithful as they.  
I shall be my mother and father's son tomorrow. 
Again God bless you all.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
And the young people ask, 
What are they marching for?  
And I ask myself the same question.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
This week, let us pay tribute to our veterans. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I will do so myself. 
That is the late Stanley Knowles. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
They fought for their families, their communities and their country. 
Many never returned from battle.  
Each day a new page is turned.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House observed one minute of silence ] 
ALLOTTED DAY-GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
He looked back and saw Reform and he said, ``There is my answer. 
What did this young man do about it? 
He became active in politics. 
And I am proud to be a colleague of theirs.  
I would now like to say a few things about the Bloc motion. 
That is exactly what we heard.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
He is presently the public works and government services minister. 
So it definitely was a Liberal.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
That is exactly what this motion is talking about, the unfairness.  
That is what was happening. 
What did I do? 
That is what the Quebec government was doing. 
It was watching the federal government putting on taxes.  
Within an hour my kids thought there should be some results. 
When you do something you have to have results. 
What did I do? 
I had to reduce my kids' pain. 
I took the trap off. 
And now it is really hurting. 
They created it themselves. 
How can they blame the federal government? 
They looked in the mirror to see how it was working.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
I did the right thing. 
That is what the Quebec government should have done. 
It should have removed the tax. 
Instead it harmonized it and created twice the pain. 
The finance minister admitted that.  
He knew what he was talking about. 
What did the Bloc and the Quebec government do? 
They said, ``Let us jump on the gravy train. 
Let us make things roll in this country. 
Throw in another tax. 
That is the way to go''.  
Are we surprised why the Quebec government is feeling the pain? 
I am sure it hit Montreal. 
What did it do to the service industries?  
I can remember that in Winnipeg in my own province it killed tourism. 
It killed restaurants, small businesses and the service sector. 
So why did they not kill the tax?  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
I do not know why they did not kill the tax. 
It is the taxpayers who are suffering. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Out west there is a little parasite. 
We call it a tick. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
The worst of it is that the tick is not that bad. 
The pain is not that bad. 
But we have the darn mosquito that continually sucks that red blood. 
It continually acts like a tax collector. 
When there is a bankruptcy, the Liberals' philosophy is that it will create another job. 
Their philosophy is that some other sucker will come along.  
Now the Liberals are trying to take credit for inventing it. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
DIVISION ON OPPOSITION MOTION DEFERRED 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
You will find that there is unanimity on the following motion: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. whip have the unanimous consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. whip have the unanimous consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, it is unanimously moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the whip have the unanimous consent of the House to motve the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
ALLOTTED DAY-GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
When one is a member of the Bloc, things are easy. 
I am not an economist, but I know how to count. 
You seek compensation because you have been misled. 
You seek compensation because you have lost something. 
They started by setting up a Quebec sales tax. 
This tax cost them over $1.3 billion. 
Harmonization was indeed a positive thing.  
They need to find ways to get elected.  
What is in the PQ separatist stew every time? 
It is the federal government's fault. 
We had a federal election in 1997. 
You lost your majority.  
We won in terms of votes and in terms of seats.  
It would disappear from the political map.  
They have to apologize. 
They always have to say that errors of judgment were made. 
On what was said about biker gangs, I personally would have been ashamed. 
It is sad, so sad. 
Because we have the figures to prove it.  
I took some courses in economics. 
My knowledge of macroeconomics tells me this is positive. 
I find it most unfortunate.  
The figures speak for themselves. 
Flip-flaps, flap-flops, flip-flops, you name it, they do it all.  
I do not understand. 
Do you know why we have been elected? 
There is always room for improvement. 
Our policy has been effective. 
Facts prove it: compensation would mean losses. 
Once more, Quebec has had a winning partnership with the federal government. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, for questions and comments.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. 
Now, four years later, it is still with us. 
We acted with transparency. 
We were stuck with a $42 billion deficit. 
We have a debt to control. 
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
But Quebeckers are neither victims, as the Bloc claims they are, nor fools.  
Quebeckers established a dynamic and strong society within the Canadian federation. 
The facts are clear.  
Let us start with today's motion. 
In this, the Bloc is echoing its provincial masters. 
It espouses the position of the Parti Quebecois government. 
This wrongly implies that federal programs are structured in such a way.  
Quebec also receive other benefits from the federal government. 
I would like to enumerate a few. 
We have convincing proof that federal programs are based on equitable rules. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
We heard the member misquote our leader. 
He even said that the figures prove the Liberals' good performance. 
That is the crux of the question.  
Madam Speaker, I have a hard time keeping a straight face. 
I am not denigrating people who suffer from psychiatric disorders. 
How many times have they changed their position? 
Let me count the times.  
Then in 1992 they changed their position again. 
My God, how many times is that?  
The motion reads as follows: 
The GST Act came into force on January 1, 1991. 
A business must collect this 7% tax from the consumer. 
We in Quebec were good sports. 
This money belongs to the unemployed and to the employers who contribute to it. 
Has this government really taken steps to stop waste? 
Let me remind you of the facts. 
Let us think about hungry children.  
Second, it ought to follow the recommendations of the auditor general to the letter. 
Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
He should apply his remarks to himself.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This is not a point of order. 
The hon. member for Saint-Eustache-Sainte-Therese has the floor.  
Madam Speaker, I will continue with my speech.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Once again Bloc members are crying. 
There has been no loss established. 
In fact, there has been a gain. 
I think members should ask themselves is it fair. 
The answer will be somewhat from a spoiled child. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I would like the hon. member from the Bloc to answer a question. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
As if we were asking for money that did not belong to us. 
You cannot speak that way, sir. 
It is an offence to Quebeckers. 
Madam Speaker, I can understand the emotion and the indignation of my friend from Manicouagan. 
I can understand how a person can rise and jump about a bit. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Abitibi has the floor.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
First of all, let us talk about the position of the Bloc Quebecois. 
We fixed his fiddle.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
Because it is not coming from your neck of the woods.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
It is steadily decreasing. 
They knew there was an agreement with Ottawa.  
We were not going to foot the bill for this reform. 
These people are getting refunds. 
We never hear anything about that, but it is good for these people. 
They tend to consume less that we do.  
This is why Mrs. Marois supported free trade.  
When it took place, quite a few PQ members were absent.  
But one thing should be said, according to my notes- 
Could the member give us the list of those who were present?  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
Not bad for a member in Ottawa.  
It had become necessary to replace the federal sales tax. 
Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
Madam Speaker, you are telling me that my time is almost up. 
I thought I had 20 minutes for my speech.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
You have 11 minutes left.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
Do I have confirmation that I have 11 minutes left? 
You see, this side also has learned to count.  
As of January 1, I repeat, the base was extended. 
It now includes services and personal property.  
What happened on January 1, 1992? 
We know that several million dollars worth of facilities and equipment were involved. 
They are in a very good position to do good work.  
They are all there. 
It is important to know these facts.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Was he living in the past, in the present or in the future? 
Was he talking like a Conservative or a Liberal? 
Figures were quoted to us, right and left. 
It only goes to reinforce our request. 
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
Madam Speaker, I have a lot of respect for the hon. member. 
Throughout the process, the Canadian government was very transparent. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask a question to the hon. member for Abitibi. 
Where did he get that? 
There comes a time when we have to stop talking nonsense here. 
He should understand that. 
That is not hard to understand. 
He should understand that.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am trying to be fair. 
I received these figures today.  
We never know when the opposition will present a motion. 
The member said: ``I do not understand the member across the way''.  
You do not understand a thing.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
They have a majority.  
Down with the GST.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I do not know if I will be using all of my 10 minutes.  
It is interesting to hear the Reform members and the government members talk about hypocrisy. 
This is not my idea of justice. 
That is the Liberal way. 
And we are hit by this tax on top of all that. 
We are the provinces who pay the most for a stamp in this country. 
I think they should be ashamed of themselves.  
We have to look at what the tax really brings. 
Could you tell me what it is?  
We are not allowed to say such things in this place.  
I think we really have to go see what happened. 
The Liberals criticized the Conservatives. 
They got elected on the GST, really. 
They came back and said ``Yes, yes, the deficit was bigger''. 
First things first, the deficit-that has to be settled right away. 
Who has paid down the deficit? 
Those are the people who paid down the deficit.  
But nobody mentions that.  
I congratulate these people. 
The government did not look elsewhere to pay for it.  
It was just another tax. 
It is not a tax. 
They did not increase taxes. 
I would not want them to admit that they increased them.  
Our businesses are being affected. 
Only Prince Edward Island escaped from this.  
It is true that there was a bribe. 
It is us, the people from the Atlantic region. 
It is always the people who have a hard time making ends meet.  
So I will end on that.  
It is a very unfair tax. 
They are paying tax on electricity. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the hon. member and I sympathize with her.  
Many things were said by the government. 
Actually, its members were the official opposition when the GST was brought in. 
All through the debate today we have heard about hypocrisy. 
I would think that this is the height of it. 
I wish she had been here. 
Perhaps we would have had more help. 
I do not recall hearing from her party at that time. 
That is the important part. 
It may be millions or billions. 
That is the only thing that is important. 
It is a very unfair tax that makes lower income people pay more again. 
That is what concerns me and my people.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
She spoke with great humanity. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Bourassa on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is not a point of order. 
It is a point of debate. 
The hon. member for Manicouagan.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite shows a lack of respect. 
He should know that we are legitimately elected representatives of Quebeckers. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his kind words. 
It is true that respect is sorely lacking in the House. 
It is something that can be felt by outsiders. 
I hope it will get better over time. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
I will raise a couple of points in this discussion. 
The GST is a very regressive tax measure. 
That has been enunciated by a number of other speakers. 
We know the idea originated with the Conservatives. 
What did the Liberals do after making those strong statements? 
They did a double take. 
Canadians were hoodwinked on this issue. 
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
I would like to know if she supports the merits by the Bloc's contention. 
That is the motion. 
I would like to hear from the member on that.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
We are dealing with an unfair regressive tax measure to begin with. 
The blending of the GST with provincial tax does not make it any better.  
We would phase out the GST in the context of comprehensive tax reform.  
That kind of package is workable. 
It provides a real alternative to the Liberal government. 
I would heartily ask for their support for this kind of alternative.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
I would like to mention two facts, however. 
It was an expensive lesson to the people of Ontario. 
The NDP supposedly represented social justice, but we saw what it cost.  
British Columbia, as well.  
British Columbia, as well. 
What is happening, Mr. Speaker? 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Of course we support them. 
It affects the vast majority of Canadians who want to see change.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
The comments of the Reform Party leave me perplexed. 
I want the explanation. 
I would like to see the numbers.  
Let us go back to this little history lesson. 
The history lesson is very simple. 
This is a simple lesson in economics. 
We could continue to gather revenue. 
We could continue to pay down the deficit. 
Some day we could even think about tackling the debt.  
Is that the way we are headed? 
I question the wisdom.  
No partisan stuff coming from over there.  
Of course it is partisan. 
I will tell you what else, it makes sense. 
You are not going to pay down the debt overnight by snapping your fingers. 
It takes a plan and it takes action. 
You have to have both.  
They thought it was a good idea. 
We had to have free trade. 
Now they want to get rid of it.  
There has been enough time wasted on rhetoric here today.  
There is no magic here. 
There are a lot of hard decisions to be made and that is all. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I know the Conservatives really believe in cost cutting. 
What kind of a plan do you have to follow to do that? 
That really helped us here in the House. 
That relieved the debtload quite a bit.  
What do we have to do to follow that plan? 
I would like the formula.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciated listening to the comments from the hon. member to the right. 
However they continued in the same vein as the previous government they replaced. 
My hon. colleague mentioned a plan of action. 
That is what is happening.  
Then we will see what will happen in the next four years.  
Madam Speaker, the answer is very quick, very simple and to the point. 
Where is the plan? 
We are living the plan today. 
The success of this country today is directly from free trade. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Is the sunshine in the order of $600 billion worth of debt?  
Madam Speaker, repetition becomes boring after a while. 
Obviously the member did not listen to the answer the last time. 
We had to bring in free trade. 
That is not a tough equation. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, if it is Jurassic Park it is not for me. 
There will have to be another sequel.  
I think he was obliquely taking credit for it.  
And they did not happen from policies which have come in since 1993 either.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Is this, in his opinion, the glory, the success of the two old parties?  
I have explained it as best I can. 
I cannot explain it any more. 
We do have unacceptable unemployment, absolutely. 
We have to take some action.  
But you did not do anything about it.  
Free trade was brought in by one party. 
That allowed economic growth. 
It drove the manufacturing sector of this nation. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, there is a very interesting debate going on over there. 
It is quite comical.  
At the federal level we have been successful in restoring the nation's finances. 
The deficit this government inherited will be eliminated no later than 1998-99. 
The Canadian dollar is sound. 
There is a feeling of confidence and optimism in the national economy. 
This novel idea is an example of a new style of Canadian federalism that works. 
This may be the most important new program of this generation. 
There will be many potential benefits for the people of Quebec. 
The mechanics are simple. 
This will reduce demands for social assistance payments at the provincial and territorial level. 
Thus each province will have new money freed up to use for its special needs.  
It is clear that Quebeckers are benefiting very much from the new EI program. 
A number of these special areas are in Quebec. 
There have been 22,500 jobs created and 14,500 of them are in Quebec. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It being 5.50 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings. 
(Divisions deemed demanded and deferred) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This bill was not my idea. 
Police officers in all of our ridings need our help on this issue. 
I will explain why. 
That is where we are today.  
I will first explain what Bill C-211 does. 
Why is this necessary? 
It is difficult and it is time consuming. 
That is to say the least. 
The outcome of such a story unfortunately is all too often the same. 
Our police need our help and understanding, not our fighting. 
If a person does not have it on them, what do the police do? 
They have to get a warrant. 
They have to say ``Excuse me, would you wait here for six hours? 
I will be back''. 
It just does not work.  
A person on UTA has to abstain from the use of alcohol. 
They know they are not supposed to be there.  
It is not rational for a policeman to say ``Just hang on there. 
I'll be back in a little while''. 
What happens when the policeman goes? 
Non-communication with specified individuals. 
Another condition is not to own or operate a motor vehicle. 
For example, an offender is released on parole with a condition to abstain from alcohol. 
Instead, the offender's parole supervisor must be notified. 
It is in the process of happening so no action can be taken.  
Ironically, many of these conditions of release are similar to the conditions of probation. 
He gives me this example.  
He gives this example. 
That is what I am trying to explain. 
It is unreasonable to even ask.  
I recall very few bills which have been successful. 
These bills would help ordinary Canadians.  
They are asking for our assistance.  
Quite frankly, they could not care less. 
I guess I was a little naive at that time. 
We had a great debate in the House that day. 
Everybody agreed with it. 
It got stuck somewhere in committee. 
No one on the government side resurrected it.  
My concern at the time was what was going to happen next. 
Everybody in the House agreed with it. 
Where will it go? 
He did a lot of research. 
He and his colleagues believe in the House. 
They believe in what we are doing. 
They believe we can effect change for them and for their families and our families. 
We cannot disappoint these people time and time again. 
This is a practical common issue. 
We must have change. 
That says nothing at all about our willingness.  
I ask members to vote positively for Bill C-211.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The bill, as introduced by the hon. member, would have two consequences. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
What is important here? 
My answer must be yes.  
I cannot sit by while they distort the facts. 
I am a member of an opposition party, but an opposition party that is fair. 
I know it does not suit you to hear the facts. 
That having been said, with the provisions of the Criminal Code- 
Maybe you don't have institutions like we do.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Would hon. members please give everyone a chance to hear the speeches.  
Then I will give them the right information.  
The police officer will use what I have here, the Criminal Code. 
There are revocation mechanisms, the police can go and get them and so on.  
The worst I heard concerns being under the influence. 
I think it is for political purposes.  
The final example is theft, and breaking and entering. 
It can perhaps be improved.  
The judges would be replaced by a computer. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I do not claim to understand the law in this regard. 
I have heard conflicting claims.  
I have heard the hon. member say otherwise. 
I do not know.  
Some people's minds are made up. 
That is fair enough. 
There may be other alternatives.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I fully endorse this.  
I say so with some experience myself.  
I have spoken personally to a number of police officers as well.  
The difficulty is in the timing. 
In rural Canada detachments often have one or two officers. 
Often the justice of the peace is responsible for a vast territory. 
He may simply be out in the barn. 
This is a very timely debate. 
It touches on much of the same subject matter that is being discussed today.  
This is not an arbitrary detention. 
There is an important distinction to be made.  
The individual is paying his debt to society. 
He has been afforded early release and has now run afoul of those conditions.  
I generally support the change, with some reservations. 
Any form of arbitrary detention has to be carefully scrutinized. 
The key word is arbitrary. 
I would suggest that this is true of any amendment made to the Criminal Code. 
This is merely a caution that I raise.  
Perhaps we could clarify the language in the bill. 
The intent of this bill is positive. 
I am pleased to say that we in the Conservative Party support it.  
Overall there are changes that can be made to the Criminal Code. 
It would be a responsible thing for them to do.  
A convicted person forfeits the rights which are afforded to all Canadians.  
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to address this motion.  
The hon. member's bill as drafted would do two things. 
This enables police to arrest the offender and bring him or her into custody.  
We know very well the position of the Reform Party on that.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
But this was not case. 
In the end the bill passed the Commons. 
It forbids the importation of MMT. 
It is a bill that bans the importation of a product. 
What is the outcome likely to be? 
There are two possible outcomes. 
How is it going to affect Canadians? 
The answers are clear. 
Canadians can pay at the gas pumps or Canadians can pay through their taxes.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Three highly respected international arbiters have been appointed to the tribunal. 
Mr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel of Germany has agreed to serve as the presiding arbiter.  
On October 2 the parties met with the tribunal to discuss procedural issues. 
At the meeting the schedule for the coming months was set. 
The first oral hearing will be February 24 and February 25, 1998. 
That is for the competent tribunal to decide.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.56 p.m.)
