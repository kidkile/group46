The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
It is time to put some teeth into the act.  
LABELLING OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present to the House today.  
The first one has to do with health warning labels. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition has to do with the family.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The various complaints of Captain (Ret'd) Mackinnon are now before the courts. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Why did this happen in the Saguenay? 
Why did we create the first marine park in Canada? 
We Canadians are often the first to do things. 
We have worked with the Americans on major environmental matters. 
We have how many time zones, how many climate zones? 
Now today we have another first.  
It was the dream of a member of Parliament who was not of my persuasion. 
He happened to be the local member of Parliament for the area. 
It is about working together. 
The beluga whale grows up to six metres in length. 
For years they have been known for their remarkably varied vocal repertoire. 
More than 500 beluga whales live within the park's boundaries. 
Together Canadians are moving toward that goal.  
This country is winter and winter is our country. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
I have been very fortunate. 
I have a tremendous appreciation for nature.  
Perhaps that is where we would end up with a difference of opinion.  
I had just finished passing a Greyhound bus and I slowed down to a stop. 
I was wondering if he saw it as something he wanted to mangle or attack. 
I have a strong feeling about nature and what we have in Canada.  
Bill C-7 does not involve any transfer of land. 
The Government of Quebec retains ownership of the seabed and subsoil resources. 
Existing laws remain applicable in the park.  
The legislative process that we enter into in the House is very important. 
All steps in the process are very important. 
There is collaboration in the involvement of local and regional organizations in protecting the site. 
I am a little confused with the funding. 
I heard the minister in her speech talk about the figure of $30.7 million. 
I am trying to portray the issue of the dollars and cents.  
However there does seem to be some confusion about them. 
I cite Gros Morne as a template. 
Gros Morne is 20 to 25 years old. 
They were very simple.  
We are talking about the moose and land animals there. 
We cannot possibly foresee the technological capacity of boats that will be in this area. 
I have one criticism that could be considered partisan. 
Why does the legislation come at the very tag end? 
What are the implications for commercial and sports fisheries on the St. Lawrence? 
What are the implications for other uses of the river? 
I cite by way of example a situation in my constituency. 
On the Columbia River are very delicate nesting areas. 
I cannot imagine what if anything was going through their heads. 
Those people use the river responsibly. 
Why do I say that it does not really solve the problem? 
The 10-horsepower limit means nothing.  
There is another issue. 
We must be very careful with this bill.  
Finally, what precedents does this bill establish for future parks? 
Legislation does not happen in a vacuum. 
Legislation works almost like an onion, layer upon layer. 
We are concerned about a number of things. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Lawrence Marine Park Act. 
The parties recognized, and I quote: 
(c) protecting the territory and other resources; 
(d) developing these resources for the benefit of present and future generations; 
(e) creating public awareness of these resources.  
This proposed marine park innovates in three main areas. 
And finally, there has never before been such an innovative consultation process.  
I would like to give a broad outline of the consultation process. 
Instead, the government chose to let it die on the Order Paper.  
It will be the first federal-provincial salt water marine park.  
It implements the 1990 federal-provincial agreement.  
It deals with the water column within the park boundaries.  
The document defines that zone as follows: 
The bill creates a procedure for changing park boundaries. 
In the case of a corporation, the maximum fine is $500,000.  
Scientists will certainly contribute to the supervision of environmental aspects of this work. 
But, for now, Quebec is still part of Canada. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Toxic contaminants from upriver sources have been identified as the primary culprit. 
There is another fact which may be overlooked. 
The requirement for the protection of this ecosystem becomes an absolute necessity.  
It is a hallmark in intergovernmental co-operation. 
Both levels agreed to honour their respective jurisdictions. 
The degree of public participation and input must also be recognized. 
The communities were consulted. 
Aboriginal participation was ensured. 
I look forward to raising these important considerations at committee.  
Perhaps we should ask why there is no mention of species at risk. 
Through the years this can be interpreted as a basic oversight easily corrected by committee.  
This process has evolved over many years. 
A national marine conservation areas policy is in its infancy. 
It is truly to be congratulated.  
Banff, the original jewel, was established in 1885.  
The Quebec government retains administration for the seabed and subsoil resources.  
The department must commit to acting in a responsible and co-operative manner. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
This bill touches me particularly, therefore, in some ways.  
The need for environmental standards was also mentioned in the speeches. 
On this subject, people speak of the mouth of the Saguenay. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
In 1986 the PC government approved the national marine park's policy. 
There are various components that need to be examined. 
The first took place in December 1990 regarding the boundaries of the park. 
Local residents wanted a larger protected area.  
We all know the more people you consult the more ideas are brought forward. 
This was followed up by the national marine conservation areas system plan in 1995. 
We must adopt this legislation as soon as possible. 
I would like to share with you a small story. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
It was referred to as the Fundy Isles Marine Park. 
This collision between the park and the traditional fisheries was there. 
It was a major obstacle at that time. 
Has consideration been given to that? 
And is it being debated at the local level in Nova Scotia? 
The points the hon. member raises are very important.  
Without those consultations there would be dangers. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
So this is important for the whole region.  
This is obviously not a good day to engage in partisan politics. 
It was substantial environmentally with the acid rain treaty. 
Several ridings are affected. 
I thank everyone who played a role in this wonderful project.  
She put the final touches on the bill. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
The Saguenay marine park is an exceptional achievement. 
In 1993, consultation was expanded. 
The selection of a site is not an accident. 
It is the harbour of 54 species of vertebrates and 248 species of invertebrates.  
This park is a model for the future.  
The ecological integrity is the very essence, the very heart of a park. 
Without ecological integrity all the rest dies.  
We need education and that depends on the ecological integrity of a park. 
We need tourism and that depends on the proper ecological use of a park.  
We needed to do the same on our side. 
I think a number of conclusions should be drawn from this project. 
It is an exceptional tool for promoting public awareness.  
It is therefore a unifying bill above all. 
Along with health, the ecology is something that affects us all. 
We find our common ground through the extraordinary medium of the environment.  
Indeed the environment is one of the greatest binding threads among us. 
This is a concrete example of what it should be.  
All the very best for the marine park in the Saguenay.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
I also heard messages that are quite self-explanatory. 
He spoke of successful co-operation between all stakeholders. 
I believe that this is the basic lesson that we should draw from this project. 
I would like to ask a question to my colleague. 
I fully agree with the hon. member.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
You are welcome to comment if you wish.  
Madam Speaker, it is by working together that we realize that we can succeed. 
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
We undertake that in a large number of ways.  
As I alluded, we have an extensive national park system. 
Indeed today we have 38 national parks. 
We also protect our national historic sites. 
Parks Canada operates directly almost 130 of them. 
We are able to protect and to ensure our heritage for future generations.  
I am referring to the expansion of our national parks system. 
As I mentioned earlier we have 38 national parks. 
We have 38 parks and we are represented in 24 of them.  
Good progress has been made. 
We will be proceeding with that objective in the near future. 
That is our dual mandate. 
That is the genesis of the bill. 
That is why we have moved forward. 
That is important and that is part of what we do.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Now Parks Canada is suddenly coming along and saying ``No, I do not think so''. 
They are trying to force negotiation when there is no place for negotiation.  
We will not stop you. 
The department has not responded to me.  
This is an issue of safety. 
This strip happens to be at the confluence of three valleys. 
I am going to get to the specific point on the airstrip in a second. 
That is an important mandate and stewardship which we must ensure is fulfilled. 
Many of the situations the member brought forward have to do with that balance.  
I will undertake to get that information to the member as quickly as possible.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
I have a question for our colleague. 
I would like to know what the input from the federal government will be.  
There is one small point I would like to make, however. 
This federal government has made tourism one of its priorities. 
I am sure there will be opportunities through that. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
My colleague from British Columbia talked about his experience in the Rockies. 
One can proudly call them national treasures. 
These treasures also belong to the citizens of the world. 
Its bill will come into force once the federal legislation has been enacted.  
This bill is a first. 
The federal government maintains responsibility over matters such as navigation and fisheries.  
Funding for the park was provided for in the 1995 federal budget. 
Our national parks system is a great source of pride for all of us. 
Will the government do the same thing the next time? 
Are we nothing more than a rubber stamp?  
To date four areas have already been established. 
This bill outlines four zones for managing parks resources. 
There are no specific levels of protection described in this bill. 
They are more clearly outlined in the 1995 management plan. 
On a related note, some concern also exists with respect to the regulations.  
My main concern deals with the accountability of the minister. 
I support the general principle of this bill. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
There is also the Manoir Tadoussac, in Tadoussac, which is really beautiful. 
This area is well worth a visit. 
I hope this will entice people who are listening today. 
Mrs. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
As you know, this fjord opens onto the largest estuary in the world. 
This is a place blessed with a large variety of living organisms. 
This is the most beautiful site in our country to be.  
The time to pass the marine park legislation has finally arrived. 
(c) the protection of the territory and its other resources; 
(e) the appreciation of these resources by the public.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the motion carried.  
This bill is therefore referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.  
One of the first priorities is to connect Canadians. 
Last February agreement was reached to extend the GATS to cover basic telecommunications. 
Under the agreement, we will be making a few changes here, in Canada.  
We will put an end to Telesat's monopoly on fixed satellite services.  
Our transparent and independent regulatory and competition regimes will be maintained.  
This bill provides the legislative framework required to make these changes.  
Savings to consumers are in the billions of dollars. 
And the benefit is not just in services. 
We are also strengthening our ability to enforce standards for telecommunications equipment.  
We must pass this bill as rapidly as possible. 
I wish to point out that Teleglobe approves of this initiative.  
The benefits flowing from the GATS agreement are significant. 
We are working on a number of fronts to build. 
The OECD Canada conference is an important step in this direction. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
We have had a monopolistic approach to the development of the industry. 
Time and distance no longer are the factors they were in the past. 
Our world is changing.  
Is the process impartial? 
We have no way of knowing from this legislation. 
There is no criteria outlined for granting of licences.  
It has a track record of picking winners and losers. 
Build in the safeguards so that accusations cannot be made. 
There is a better approach.  
You will have the floor when we return to the debate.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Frank immigrated to Canada from Glasgow, Scotland in 1950. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
This will be done despite the following.  
The government has had four years to prepare for Kyoto. 
Where is the leadership?  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
This year's theme is ``A healthy partnership-You and your pharmacist. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
This is not an east-west issue. 
Here is what one Albertan had to say in the Edmonton Journal : 
The dinosaurs did not die out four million years ago. 
They are still huffing, puffing and snorting on the other side of the Chamber.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The hon. member for Whitby-Ajax.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
More than a hundred have lost their lives and hundreds more have been wounded. 
Canada and the nations around the world remain in their debt for their protection- 
STATUS OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
But what are the facts?  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
In reality, greenhouse gas reduction means good business. 
These steps will make Canada a world leader in energy efficiency. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Among other things it causes devastating neurological damage. 
This is everybody's problem.  
This is not an abortion bill. 
MUNICIPAL ELECTION IN VERDUN 
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Would that get its attention?  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Now let me talk about real humiliation. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My question is very straightforward. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It was all excited about a carbon tax. 
We said a year ago that there was no such plan. 
Should we have an income tax increase- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My question was not that difficult. 
And if he does not know, he should say so. 
Do not run away, do not make excuses and do not change the subject. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first we have to have a deal. 
That is the first point. 
The Reform Party is against it. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I ask the prime minister- 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yes, I think we should go and play bingo. 
They really do not know what we have said on that. 
She replied to them later.  
We are responsible on this side. 
They are irresponsible on the other side.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is our position. 
The prime minister has expressed it well.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
We can read in the newspaper where the Americans are coming from. 
We can read in the newspaper where the European community is coming from. 
We cannot find out in this House where this government is coming from.  
Where is the finance minister going to get the money to finance the Kyoto deal?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He is the only one who spoke about it.  
They are still at the stage where they think the planet is flat.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that of course is quite untrue.  
Our sole intent is to respect federal responsibilities.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That is in the bill, moreover.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the position expressed by the hon. member is a somewhat odd one. 
It is very odd to find a constitutional question in all this. 
I am extremely surprised and disappointed. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is a federal responsibility, but we are respecting provincial jurisdiction.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the prime minister. 
We still do not know what positive position the government will put forward at Kyoto.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
As members can see, there is no agreement.  
The ministers will be meeting on November 16.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Who is going to resign over this broken promise?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will finish what I was saying. 
We do not tell the provinces to do exactly what we want.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not need to table anything. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
However, a number of promises were made that were not kept. 
In fact, they had engaged in anti-rhetoric. 
Everything this member said he did not mean.  
The Canadian people were tremendously deceived and I was too. 
When the hon. member was in Rio he should have set commitments- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
However, questions remain for the government. 
It is now nearly a month later.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There are still some questions unresolved.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. member is completely mistaken. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The details of the bill are clear. 
Provincial jurisdiction is respected. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I want to congratulate customs. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
He did not answer the question.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member does not know the facts at all. 
We do an excellent job. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Only this Liberal government is turning a deaf ear.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There was excellent news in the region yesterday. 
There was talk of Noranda creating 350 jobs in Asbestos. 
Clearly, things are happening. 
Our government wants to help these people re-enter the job market.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, each government is free to decide on its course of action. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the position of the Judge Advocate General has been extended for three months.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Judge Advocate General is responsible for the military justice system.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
If further evidence is brought forward, then charges will be laid.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Does the government intend to remind the CRTC that- 
The Minister of Industry has the floor.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I could not hear the whole question. 
We will see what the CRTC's decision will be.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for a very timely question.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think I answered the question initially.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Speaker, a variety of initiatives are under way. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
My question is for the minister of fisheries. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It is therefore important to have information on catch.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We take these concerns very seriously.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Canadians want to know.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question if for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
This exponentially increases the ability for foreign investors to sue the Canadian government- 
The hon. member for Essex.  
Mr. Speaker, Canadians want to know that this government- 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I could hear the end of that question.  
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It will be in our hands within a few weeks. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yes, whatever the forum we have been involved in. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
How can the government accept and justify such practices?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
We are very concerned about the extensive increase to the powers of the CRTC. 
Therefore this piece of legislation will have a very short lifespan.  
It should harmonize and relax the regulations. 
It should reduce rather than expand the CRTC protectionist role.  
We encourage a strong Canadian product that will compete well locally and internationally. 
It will also generate a substantial amount of business confidence.  
In summary I will deal with some of the positive measures of the bill. 
This should lead to lower rates for Canadians.  
Unfortunately these positives are coupled with some very significant concerns that we have. 
I will list them briefly. 
It is getting increasingly difficult to do this.  
We ask the government to entertain that. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Calgary West on a question or comment.  
Mr. Speaker, I have a tough question for the member for Calgary Centre.  
I wonder if he could enlighten the House with regard to the CRTC- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
That is why I have rushed back to my seat.  
And that competition is being carried out right under the nose of a giant. 
This then is support for the underlying principles. 
Naturally, this liberalization comes with promises for business. 
We will come back to this, if time permits. 
This liberalization is therefore favourable and suits business.  
This is not the only question we want to raise, effectively I hope. 
There is also the question of privacy. 
People feel there is less control over personal information. 
But the same thing can be said about the protection of personal information. 
This report stated, last spring: 
The scope of this legislation should be as wide as possible. 
This legislation should be enacted by the year 2000.  
I would like to add this little part that I find very important: 
The minister, the government, the CRTC, cannot do otherwise than to listen to businesses. 
So, yes, businesses need to grow and this brings considerable challenges.  
We must therefore continue to make telecommunications services available, and to increase access to them. 
They must be affordable. 
We might think there was talk of investments.  
Current rates are taking us away from the basic rate.  
We must look at the overall picture, and it cannot be done. 
Why should we want to compete in Europe? 
This eventually lead to the creation of Radio Quebec. 
Its model was based on the BBC, a publicly owned network.  
Who was asked to settle the issue? 
The supreme court, in 1931. 
What do you think it decided? 
Radio Quebec was born. 
That was what Robert Bourassa said. 
Jean-Paul L'Allier, his Minister of Communications, said: 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
We do not even favour the bill in principle. 
In 1997 we are still speaking in opposition to these trade agreements.  
The impact of this is reflected in Statistics Canada reports. 
It has been a disaster for Canada and for Canadian families.  
Canadians have experienced 84 straight months of unemployment at 9% or more. 
What kind of record is that under these free trade deals? 
That is equivalent to the loss of 700,000 jobs. 
That is the real story of- 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask for your guidance that we debate on that subject.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair was following the hon. member very closely. 
The Chair would consider the debate to be relevant.  
Mr. Speaker, thank you for those words. 
What is the government's position on this? 
What happened to that company? 
It was sacrificed as a result of free trade. 
Now we are facing the same thing in the bill that is before us today. 
That is the real history of free trade.  
The contrary is true.  
We also need the introduction of an international tax to control speculative currency trading. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
The expansion of the telecommunications industry as a result is phenomenal. 
It is totally ludicrous to blame deregulation for high unemployment. 
It does not make sense to anybody who really thinks about the situation.  
How does the hon. member rationalize her position with the facts?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
The overall effect of that has not been to create jobs.  
We are in favour of fair competition. 
We are in favour of regulation that sets a level playing field. 
MAI and these trade liberalization agreements are about corporate rule. 
We want to see a government committed to industrial infrastructure and to manufacturing. 
The facts show a different story in terms of what has happened in our economy.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Investment and growth in the economy are what creates jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
There are some very undemocratic organizations. 
Who are they accountable to? 
Not to governments, not to the people of Canada or any country. 
Or capital may never come into the country again.  
I just do not understand how that would create jobs. 
We are facing globalization. 
The member needs to listen carefully to what is actually being put forward.  
What would be the point of even having a floating currency?  
We have seen a drastic decline in that regard under the Liberal government. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
It was to be terrible for Canada. 
They have been building on it ever since. 
Bill C-17 ensures that Canada fulfils these obligations.  
Is it not odd how they have changed?  
The official opposition of the day also fought against these.  
Our caucus supports the GATS because it is a free trade agreement. 
We continue to support the principle of free trade. 
The government now realizes the 10 years was more than enough. 
After 8 years we are debating the opening of the marketplace. 
Industry wants less control in exchange for open access to the rest of the world. 
That is really the principle of the free trade agreement. 
It will not grow without these changes and the government has finally recognized it.  
We support them in their continued efforts.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
My comments are not strictly reserved for them. 
They are also directed to the Liberals across the way. 
The Liberals have flip flopped all over on the issue. 
Those Tories, those free marketeers, what a joke. 
They failed to do so. Shame on them.  
They stand and criticize the Liberals. 
The Tories opened up Canada to the world. 
Nobody liked free trade. 
Nothing ceases to amaze me.  
There would not be anything allowed outside Canadian content.  
Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member with respect to deregulation. 
It is something we all have to do.  
They have to be consistent. 
We believe in free trade. 
It creates jobs in Canada and we are proud of our record on that accomplishment.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
We obviously love to talk.  
It is important to note several factors that seem to surround our trade partnerships today. 
With it comes certain consequences.  
There are examples where the government has failed in this area. 
Granted, this can create difficulty for certain industry sectors. 
The facts are undeniable. 
I look forward to having further discussions on this bill in committee.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, once again I cannot resist commenting.  
We have come a long way. 
The hon. member is sitting in the House here. 
Luckily he is not the government. 
That would really be a scary thought.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
The prices of telephone calls for example. 
Certainly in the early 1980s it would be something like $1.60 a minute. 
These deregulations benefit ordinary people, the average wage earner tremendously. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It is a good deal for Canada. 
That will lead to more high quality jobs and economic growth.  
Canadians have gone on to become leaders in the telecommunications industry.  
It employs some 115,000 people and accounts for 3.36% of our GDP. 
Now we will see them in the international arena.  
That goal was achieved. 
We have made the following undertakings.  
We will end the Telesat monopoly on fixed satellite services.  
We will maintain our transparent and independent regulatory and competition regimes.  
The agreement on basic telecommunications is also an international milestone. 
It is this mechanism that underpins the entire agreement. 
And without it no telecommunications company could have the confidence necessary to make investments.  
In conclusion I urge the House to act quickly in passing this bill.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for those comments.  
This is very important in this agreement. 
By having an even playing field this allows other entrants into the marketplace.  
Licensing is not unique to Canada. 
Those consultations will follow and the licensing rules will be established.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
This is a very vital sector to the Canadian economy. 
We are not sitting back. 
I want to review some of the steps we have taken.  
Competition is not an end in itself. 
This can only be good.  
The government is working on a number of fronts to do this. 
But it does not stop there.  
This is being done in every department and agency in this country.  
We cannot have that infrastructure without a strong, dynamic telecommunications industry. 
The result will be better telecommunications services. 
An infrastructure will support us in the next century. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been both exhilarated and disappointed today. 
Whatever connection there is is tenuous at best.  
Those two things are completely separate. 
It would have been far more successful and far more logical.  
The issue behind this bill is to recognize the principle involved. 
If the capital does those things it does not matter where it originated.  
I do not know with whom they spoke. 
In fact, the report is from the legal counsel to the Internet service provider. 
The key phrase is whatever service the CRTC wishes to regulate. 
This is a major departure. 
It was never a part of the Telecommunications Act. 
He used the telecommunications business as an example of how this could be done. 
I congratulate the minister for doing that.  
We have to get serious about that.  
It has the right to determine these kinds of things.  
It is very interesting what these powers actually are. 
These powers establish classes of licences. 
That is one thing it does. 
It establishes the classes of services that would require a licence. 
Now we are hitting on two sides. 
First, it tells us the kinds of licences we will have. 
They may be the same but they may also be different. 
I would like to make several observations with regard to this ambiguity. 
First, it allows the establishment of many or few classes. 
It decides how many of these classes there will be.  
Second, it allows the CRTC to establish classes on an arbitrary basis. 
It sounds like someone who is getting ready for a Ph.D. dissertation. 
He takes a particular position and says this is my hypothesis. 
This is very serious. 
That is the kind of thing that could happen here. 
Far worse than that, the classes of licences could perpetuate obsolescence. 
We should look at this very carefully.  
The CRTC may now establish the conditions for the licences. 
These too have no guidelines.  
What will the conditions be? 
Will a service provider need a particular financial capability? 
Then the question becomes is this a range of services that relates to the Internet? 
We do not know.  
I do not think that is necessarily a bad requirement. 
In fact, we need far more research and development in this country.  
Neither does private enterprise commit to research and development in the proportion that it should. 
We need that kind of commitment. 
For that to be a possible condition for a licence is rather difficult.  
These are some of the questions on the business of licensing. 
However, there is an even more significant part to licensing. 
This raises all kinds of questions. 
Now we are not only determining the conditions but the circumstances that would be involved.  
These are very serious possibilities.  
This could possibly create different cost structures for different classes of licences. 
We do not know what the circumstances would be.  
It would mean that I could have the whole world before me. 
It has tremendous and horrendous implications.  
The bottom line question in all of this is that it does not increase flexibility. 
It is the very opposite.  
I think it is wonderful. 
This is a tremendous policy for the CRTC to develop. 
It is exactly what should happen.  
Finally we have competition. 
That is absolutely tremendous and the CRTC ought to be commended for it. 
This is tremendous stuff. 
That should be moved forward expeditiously. 
Tomorrow we should do that if we possibly could.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for Kelowna for his remarks. 
He appreciates the importance of telecommunications.  
I want to ask a number of questions. 
Let those who are particularly successful and good win the day. 
That is the difficulty with the bill.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I understand the CRTC is doing some advance consultation now with the industry. 
It is not any different from what we want to propose in Canada. 
The government wants to do exactly that. 
Would the member for Kelowna disagree with that?  
That is exactly right. 
Let the industry come into it rather than the government. 
That is not what the bill says. 
I wish the bill would say that. 
The issue he has raised is the right one.  
The mission statement reads: 
Let us now read the mandate of the CRTC and compare the two statements. 
Is this not interesting? 
If the lesson has been learned the CRTC should demonstrate it. 
I have talked about convergence before. 
That is a good idea. 
I think it is a backward move into the future.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
There is much talk in this bill about corporations. 
We do not mention the protection of personal information. 
Yet that is the flip side of the coin.  
I am therefore asking the Reform Party critic this question. 
I thank the hon. member for the question. 
I certainly support the idea.  
I thank the hon. member for raising it. 
I am sure we will be debating it in committee.  
He has a lot of good advice to give us all.  
The House resumed from November 3 consideration of the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
(Motion agreed to and bill referred to a committee) 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP) moved: 
She appeared before the House of Commons justice committee. 
She made a whole nation aware of this profoundly important issue.  
The life of an individual must include dying. 
Dying is the final act in the drama of life. 
The Minister of Justice said, and I quote: 
We will not sit on this. 
We will do it as quickly as we can.  
I want to pay tribute to all members of that committee for their work. 
I want to explain very carefully and very precisely what this motion seeks to achieve. 
The motion does not set out the terms for new legislation. 
It calls for the establishment of a special committee of this House. 
I note as well the issue is being debated in other parts of the world. 
In fact today we will learn the results of a referendum in Oregon. 
All of those are fundamentally important.  
I note the Canadian Palliative Care Association has acknowledged that. 
We saw that with Austin Bastable in 1996. 
We saw that just recently with my constituent, Mr. Natverlal Thakore, this year. 
This is not acceptable.  
They are happening with no guidelines, with no review, with no safeguards whatsoever. 
It is happening now but in the shadows, behind closed doors with no safeguards. 
When people ask what about the slippery slope, those dangers are clearly already there.  
Of course there must be strict safeguards in place. 
I emphasize that what is being debated here is fundamentally different. 
I will share a couple of examples.  
I got a letter from the son of Quebec author and actor Doris Lussier. 
His son is Pierre Lussier. 
He was a total advocate of civilized death.  
I could read from many other letters. 
He said that her jaw would sometimes dislocate when she yawned. 
Several huge bed sores developed which never healed. 
She tried to kill herself by refusing to eat. 
That is no way to die.  
In closing, I want to appeal to all members of the House. 
Palliative care in and of itself is not enough. 
Sue Rodriguez had superb palliative care. 
These are just two examples to illustrate the complexity of this issue.  
No one in this House would not be moved by these tragedies.  
It is clear that the special Senate committee was aware of this. 
I am sure we would all concur.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It published a 250 page report in June 1995.  
The Senate committee held 86 meetings and heard from 242 witnesses representing 92 organizations. 
For these reasons, I cannot support this motion.  
For the record, here is my personal view on this issue. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
This has had a very significant impact on my life. 
Euthanasia is not withholding unwanted heroics. 
I do not believe that it is adequate to just listen to those arguments. 
A good debater can make those positions well. 
Holland of course is probably the best jurisdiction. 
The Dutch experience is as follows.  
I spoke of criteria that would be used by the proponents. 
In Holland the criteria are as follows. 
A request for euthanasia must be voluntary. 
It cannot just be casual. 
There must be intolerable or hopeless suffering. 
Finally, there must be a report to the authorities, a report to the coroner.  
How rare is euthanasia in Holland? 
This is not palliative care or surgeons that I am talking about. 
GPs permit about 2,000 cases of euthanasia per year. 
These were individuals who could have given their permission. 
It is quite surprising.  
This is from 1990. 
In Holland doctors have taken over end of life decisions. 
This has not become an empowering thing for the patient. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
This is an issue that has been discussed for a long time.  
At one time or another, the government will have to examine carefully this whole matter. 
I wish to take the opportunity to congratulate the member who tabled this motion. 
I know that it is an issue that he has been closely involved with. 
The present context is not an easy one. 
Legislating euthanasia and assisted suicide therefore poses many ethical problems. 
As we heard on the news, the decision is now under appeal.  
There have been different interpretations in the media. 
However, some extremely important issues have been raised. 
It is a complex task for a committee to study a bill. 
Euthanasia and assisted suicide are related issues. 
We can easily predict that studying these matters will take a long time. 
For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I move: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in the debate tonight. 
We certainly would not deny the member that?''  
The debate reminds me of the abortion debate. 
I was a member of Parliament at that time. 
This reminds me of that debate. 
I do not always agree with the member. 
He took a very courageous stand in defence of his position.  
Canadians are looking for parliament to give them guidance. 
I do not support the idea of spending money on a committee. 
The Senate did that. 
The Senate struck its committee. 
A couple of the members have mentioned the cost of that study. 
It becomes very expensive.  
The secret to the whole process lies right here in the House of Commons. 
All members of Parliament are going to be here. 
They are paid to be here. 
They are paid to stand and present their positions. 
That is what I think should happen. 
An intelligent, reasonable, persuasive debate should take place in the House. 
I want to define euthanasia. 
This is basically a definition that Canadians should hear. 
The original Greek meaning of the term euthanasia is easy or good death. 
It is important to remember that. 
That is what the member is asking. 
We do not disagree with that. 
The views of the respective individuals are interesting when we are engaged in discussion. 
There are some areas about which we fundamentally agree. 
There are some areas about which we fundamentally disagree.  
This is the place where that debate has to happen. 
That goes back to the fundamentals.  
We are talking about the continuation of human life or the termination of human life. 
It is about the continuation of life.  
We have all had loved ones who have been terminally ill. 
It is worthy of debate and it is worthy of consideration. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment proposed by the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm is in order. 
Accordingly, the debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
I was told the debate ended at 7.06 p.m. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
If the hon. member will begin, we will advise him of when he must end.  
Who are we to decide that we can terminate a life?  
I could cite many cases if I had time. 
I would like to conclude by quoting from Drs. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member will have the floor when debate resumes.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
They ignored their commitment.  
Such side effects are relatively rare, but were considered a particular concern in military personnel.  
Instead, the minister said there was an ongoing investigation. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
I am sorry I could not answer.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Burnaby-Douglas.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Unfortunately the response to both those questions was completely unsatisfactory.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
And this is what we did.  
The Government of Canada is the People's Summit largest contributor. 
Canada will continue to so. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Quite frankly I thought the question was fairly simple. 
I would like to give the House a little background. 
The concept is fairly simple. 
It has sales in excess of $50 million on world-wide distribution. 
It is a typical board. 
It has no government subsidies. 
It works extremely well and it is self-sufficient.  
It also has working for it a chief executive officer and president. 
The current president and chief executive officer has been with the corporation for 16 years. 
Well, I did not get an answer. 
What I got was some gobbledegook but let me tell you what the answer is. 
He retired as a member of Parliament.  
Did they ask the board and the chairman? 
Did they consult with them? 
The answer is no, they did not consult with the board or the chairman. 
It was simply a matter of a political appointment.  
My second question was quite simple as well. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The member opposite has nothing of substance to say. 
Mr. Fewchuk as a member of Parliament was not loud nor bombastic. 
He held a quiet conviction and he did his job.  
He is well qualified.  
PROGRAM FOR OLDER WORKERS ADJUSTMENT 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The minister has no compassion for these workers. 
Instead, he designated the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
They asked him for an improved POWA program. 
This minister has no compassion. 
He is prepared to go as far as $3 million in active measures. 
It is not surprising- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Provinces are also moving in that direction. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.30 p.m.)
