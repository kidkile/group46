Monday, April 20, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
NATIONAL HEAD START PROGRAM 
The House resumed from February 19 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
They referred to encroachment into the area of provincial jurisdiction. 
They have tied this motion into the Canadian unity debate. 
It affects all Canadians.  
In its 1996 report at page 2 of the executive summary it states: 
This motion is on all fours with the secretary of state's comments.  
He said that caring for children should be Canada's number one priority. 
This motion encourages him to do just that.  
Pooling of resources will reduce costs of implementation. 
Ideas and successes can be shared. 
Canada has come under criticism by the International Centre for the Prevention of Crime. 
Crime costs Canadians approximately $46 billion a year. 
Programs as proposed by this motion go to the source. 
Some of the facts presented were: 
Child maltreatment in Canada is estimated at one in five.  
One sex offender in three suffered some kind of sexual trauma as a child.  
Of course we know that such a state is unattainable. 
I urge my colleagues in this place to give it careful consideration.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Unfortunately poverty is the largest single factor affecting young Canadians today. 
Still other children experience neglect or abuse. 
It is estimated that one in five children are living in conditions of risk.  
The Canadian prenatal nutrition program, or CPMP, funds 264 projects in 751 communities. 
The projects also account for 30,000 hours of volunteer time every month. 
I can speak from experience regarding the CAPC. 
No decisions have been made regarding the specific areas of action. 
Therefore I ask all members of the House to vote accordingly.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
We are all concerned about giving children a good start in life. 
It may be a question of identity and culture. 
The same is true in this debate. 
Quebec's choice must also be respected.  
It must be pointed out that a good start has already been made. 
The causes are numerous and they were clearly identified.  
They identified the problems, along with their causes and risk factors. 
Then, they proposed solutions while also setting realistic goals. 
All took part in the development of the program. 
Let us tell it as it is. 
There are serious child poverty problems in Canada. 
These individuals cannot qualify for EI benefits. 
They are therefore forced unto social assistance and on the way to living in poverty.  
What has the government done to help eliminate child poverty? 
We must avoid falling in this trap at all cost. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Either way, we are going to spend resources. 
What is the best way to spend them?  
Stating the question is easy. 
The answer, however, is far more problematic. 
Unfortunately influence in society is not like physics. 
In other words, the larger the target community, the less measurable will be the results.  
However, it is not as neat as we would like it to be. 
There appears to be a correlation but it is not neat.  
I do not think that is something to be proud of. 
The hon. member proposes a long term solution which has some merit. 
The debate goes on and on.  
I do not find myself seriously disagreeing with the hon. member's motion. 
Only it urges a more coherent view on the government.  
I support the thrust of this motion. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I congratulate him on bringing this matter forward.  
I think it will receive support in the hearts of every member in the House.  
The two areas, of course, lie within the jurisdiction of the provinces. 
There are aspects of this ongoing in Canada already. 
We met last week with Lola Chapman who heads the Maple Ridge program. 
The figures she gave us started three years ago. 
That is now down to an average of eight per day. 
This is very commendable.  
We must not shrink from the use of incarceration. 
We visited closed custody and open custody facilities. 
This motion brings an awareness. 
There have been enormous successes.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I would like to speak in support of Motion No. 261. 
We must not abandon the family structure of our people. 
All Canadians want to live in a family environment.  
The community base is crucial. 
The aboriginal head start program made that a major priority. 
Community groups had to be involved in the development of head start. 
The other aspect is the educational systems in Canada.  
We do not need to duplicate administration. 
The head start program will require curriculum development. 
An integral part of the aboriginal head start program is language development. 
That is not the intention of the community aboriginal head start programs.  
The communities want to keep their languages first. 
However, their first language must be developed first.  
It mentions hospitals and schools. 
There is more readiness of schools than hospitals in our communities.  
Many of the head start outreach programs are at the home base. 
Keeping a family together is very important.  
I have another example concerning crime. 
Reform members have taken this as the flagship of reducing crime. 
There is a statistic which astounded me. 
This points to the family structure.  
This is a concern I have with the head start program as well.  
In my community I have seen the evolution of urbanization. 
The federal and provincial governments should support the family as much as possible. 
My message is to keep the families intact.  
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
There is no doubt that youth crime is alarming. 
It is even a problem among elementary school children and preschoolers. 
What is the solution? 
This is a constructive approach to deal with the problem.  
Every year thousands of disadvantaged children enter school for the first time. 
Many have health problems and many lack self-confidence. 
This program will have a significant impact on communities. 
What is the priority? 
The priority must be our children. 
They learn how to learn at an early age. 
Do they know how much that costs? 
It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
This is why we are having this debate today. 
We want to stress the importance of little children, young and formative pieces of clay. 
Children are and must be our priority.  
It is an investment we will never regret.  
I am passionate about early childhood education for disadvantaged, tiny children. 
We must be on the cutting edge of this initiative. 
We have eliminated the deficit. 
It is now time to invest in our children, our greatest asset. 
We have to take responsibility because it is our duty.  
Let us come out of this debate with a consensus. 
I see that the hour has come to an end. 
I will continue the next time the matter is before the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
On April 1, 1999 Canada will have a new territory, the territory of Nunavut. 
If we think back on the history, it is a fascinating one. 
I have had the great fortune to travel to the north. 
He travelled through the islands of the high Arctic. 
There were different strategies put forward. 
The Dene suggested that we break into three different territories. 
That legislation and these amendments are real and important. 
They were not just dreamed up by this side of the House. 
We can imagine the work that goes into preparing this platform. 
With this bill we will confirm the member of Parliament for Nunavut. 
There are things that are very important in this that we must understand. 
Rather, the election must occur before.  
As I say, this is a truly exciting time. 
Members can see why Bill C-39 is required. 
This is an exciting time in Canada's history. 
We can be very proud of our country. 
We can be very proud of its heritage. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
It is a huge, rugged, impressive part of Canada. 
On behalf of the official opposition, I wish the people of Nunavut well. 
My intention is to focus entirely on part 2 of the bill. 
This section seeks to amend the Constitution of Canada. 
This is a subject which is long overdue for a thorough discussion in this House.  
There is ample historical precedent for this position.  
Why such an agreement? 
It is now my intention to lay these three cases before the House.  
Thus the Senate of Canada was conceived and brought into the world.  
There is only one thing wrong with this whole scheme. 
The new Senate was not to be democratically accountable. 
It was compromised in terms of accountability. 
It was compromised by partisan patronage. 
It was compromised in its ability to represent regional interests. 
Its equality was compromised by ineffectiveness.  
Let me give a couple of examples. 
I have carried this list around with me for a long time. 
That is not my point. 
And it is not only that institution. 
That is why it is important to distinguish. 
That is getting up into the Wayne Gretzky league.  
Even after that the most it could do was vote to suspend Thompson without pay.  
What is the public to think of Senator Taylor's travel budget? 
Senator Taylor billed Canadian taxpayers $105,000 for travel expenses. 
What is the public to think about Senator Lucier's place of residence? 
We are talking about representation of a northern territory in the Senate of Canada. 
I do not want to be one sided on this. 
Perhaps there is regrettably some truth in that. 
It can refuse to re-elect. 
It can throw us out. 
I do not want to impugn people who do not deserve to be impugned. 
This senator also co-chaired the national Liberal campaign in 1997.  
Perhaps in this connection I can mention a personal experience. 
Perhaps that may be my case.  
My family was very much involved in politics and political life in Alberta. 
He was a fellow of Italian background. 
Why do I mention this incident in the context of a discussion about the Senate? 
Someone will protest and say this is all grossly unfair. 
Are there no good senators? 
Are there no senators who are hard working and conscientious? 
Are there no senators who render public service? 
Are there no senators who are distinguished persons in their own right? 
I would reply, ``Of course there are''.  
Here is a partial list of senators who are distinguished persons in their own right.  
Senator Archibald Johnstone is a distinguished World War II veteran. 
Let me illustrate this. 
Let me quickly identify the seventh. 
The cost of the Senate is staggering. 
Our regions are big enough to be countries in their own right.  
It is high time that Canada did the same.  
Abolish unethical activity and practices. 
However, do not throw out the baby with the bath water.  
As the official opposition envisions it, the objectives of Senate reform are threefold. 
Who in the House could possibly disagree with such objectives?  
I turn now to two trails to Senate reform. 
I want to take some time to examine it thoroughly.  
Second, westerners objected to the rigid amending formula. 
Do I have that consent?  
Maybe now, if we could get it.  
The hon. member would like to table information. 
Is there unanimous consent to present the motion?  
The House has heard the gist of the motion. 
Is there agreement to accept the motion?  
7. An Elected Senate 
8. An Equal Senate 
9. Aboriginal Peoples' Representation in the Senate 
Aboriginal representation in the Senate should be guaranteed in the Constitution. 
10. Relationship to the House of Commons 
The Senate should not be a confidence chamber. 
11. Categories of Legislation 
There should be four categories of legislation: 
12. Approval of Legislation 
The House of Commons would not be able to override the Senate's veto. 
The precise definition of this category of legislation remains to be determined.  
The Senate should have the powers set out in this Consensus Report. 
13. Revenue and Expenditure Bills 
These rules should be designed to provide adequate protection to Francophones.  
Any process for challenging these declarations should be left to the rules of the Senate.  
15. Ratification of Appointments 
Senators should not be eligible for Cabinet posts.  
We now have on the record section II(A) of the Charlottetown accord. 
It contains 10 clauses pertaining to the Senate of Canada. 
That is where the trouble started. 
We can see what a shallow and misleading retort that is. 
Did the Senate reform proposals in Charlottetown provide this? 
It would have been a Senate only partially elected. 
He won nine general elections in a row.  
When my father arrived he was one of just two independent senators. 
Their study was entitled ``Representation:
This was the mid-1970s, over 20 years ago.  
This statute ought to be studied by every member of this House. 
Perhaps it is not perfect. 
All this was accomplished. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
I would point out that this is ridiculous. 
Motion for a Resolution to Authorize an Amendment to the Constitution of Canada 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today marks the launch of National Textiles Week.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, April is Cancer Awareness Month. 
In 1997 nearly 150,000 Canadians were diagnosed with cancer. 
These are the actions which are needed to fight this battle. 
The hon. member for Parkdale-High Park.  
YTV YOUTH ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Today's youth are Canada's future leaders. 
My congratulations to all the nominees, finalists and- 
The hon. member for Okanagan-Coquihalla.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
This is a unique achievement.  
It is a process, a flowing river and not a frozen structure. 
The important features of the community are its inclusiveness, commitment and consensus.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
The old style of Liberal paternalism is no longer credible in this age of democracy.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
There will be one, there won't be one, nobody knows how, why or when. 
One week they want one, the next, they no longer want one.  
People are entitled to know.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I am the commoner, not the senator. 
C.D. HOWE INSTITUTE 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Far too often people who volunteer in our community are forgotten. 
All volunteers from coast to coast help make Canada the great country that it is.  
NATIONAL ORGAN DONOR WEEK 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, where there is smoke there is fire. 
That is a fact. 
Where there is a violent criminal there is danger. 
Again they were wrong.  
My constituents in Bowden are afraid. 
Knowing how CSC functions there is nothing I can say. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I have a simple question. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Could he not look them in the eye?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I have dealt directly with them. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Ontario changed course and compensated the Dionne quintuplets. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member speaks of leadership. 
Would the hon. member propose that cash payments be made to all of those victims?  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Will he meet with those victims today?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The facts are that about 1,800 victims so far have been compensated. 
We are covering 22,000 victims.  
We in this country have taken the same approach- 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The minister says the Canadian regulator was not responsible. 
That is not true and he knows it. 
If the Canadian regulator was responsible there is negligence. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Because of that fault the Irish government paid compensation.  
We are applying the same principle in Canada. 
When governments could have acted- 
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
However, the issue of compensating the other victims remains.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, all governments in Canada have acted together. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
So states today's Financial Times . 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to respond to the leader of the opposition. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The bank mega mergers are not waiting. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear. 
Anybody who has any doubt about that had just better watch us.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the Conservative Party.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Sadly it effectively denies innocent victims fairness and compassion. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The ministers of health from all governments in this country have decided- 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
If there is no competition, then there is no merger. 
On the other hand the Minister of Finance does not seem to have a policy. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
He is the minister. 
He is supposed to have some answers.  
He promised the legislation. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
These mergers are the result of market globalization.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
We now have six big banks. 
We are looking at four big banks. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Is the hon. member interested in what small consumers have to say? 
Is he interested in the problems of rural Canada? 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do want to know what small businesses are saying. 
I have heard what they are saying. 
Why is the minister not responding to them? 
Whose side is the finance minister on? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, every time there is a new moon, Reform seems to change its position. 
C. D. HOWE INSTITUTE 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have just given the hon. member his answer. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
She has used words like ``timely fashion'', ``soon'' and ``complicated''. 
Indeed her parliamentary secretary has told us to be patient. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
My question to her is this. 
Is she not up to the job? 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
That approach will be reflected in this government's response.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is the best they can do.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Is there anything these people can do to convince this government to reconsider?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
As a result, discussions ensued. 
We analysed the facts. 
That is the basis of the decision we made.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
It is simply a frame of convenience.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I think even one American state had a test before 1986.  
The hon. member for Charlotte.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
That is a flawed position. 
These people deserve compensation. 
It is as simple as that. 
It could be as few as 20,000. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is not a question of dollars. 
It is a question of the sustainability of the public health care system.  
He is just drawing the line at a different place. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the president of Treasury Board.  
Mr. Speaker, in fact the information contained in the article was wrong. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
This is totally unacceptable.  
Will the minister call in the auditor general immediately to investigate this?  
The reality is that one out of three of those companies implements a successful program. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these submarines are state of the art. 
It has since decided to go to nuclear submarines.  
That is a great bargain. 
At least we can replace our 30 year old submarines. 
We have the capability to patrol our shores and the Arctic.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I submit this is obscene concentration.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He now wants to have an all party study.  
That is why there is going to be full- 
The hon. member for Charlotte.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
So this question is to the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Does this not send a message to the government that something has to be done? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We want to do even more. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Almost half of that was without competition.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the member gets the figures.  
That is how we give contracts to Canadians who qualify.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Not at all, Mr. Speaker. 
We have, however, said that our priority is to lower personal taxes.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I have a question for the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
Does the question of privilege arise from question period? 
Indeed, Mr. Speaker, it relates to question period.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to make it short. 
The member left the Chamber with his chair.] 
Mr. Speaker, you are not allowed to steal chairs from the House.  
I was just going to rule that is not a question of privilege.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
THUNDER BAY REGIONAL HOSPITAL 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a petition on another matter. 
The petitioners are primarily from the communities of Logan Lake and Kamloops.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 77 will be answered today. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the other questions stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is the first day back after the break. 
I would like to know where that question is.  
Mr. Speaker, my response is the same. 
I am sure what he says is true. 
I will also look into the whereabouts of Question No. 56.  
I would like to know where my question is.  
Mr. Speaker, again I have noted Question No. 51.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank this other member. 
I am always glad to respond to these points. 
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
I have received two letters asking for an emergency debate. 
The first one I received is from the hon. member for Qu'Appelle.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. 
Four of our six big banks have plans now to merge. 
This will completely transform the financial services industry in our country. 
It will impact on the constituents of all members of Parliament. 
I submit that an emergency debate is needed now. 
The financial markets have reacted starting back in January. 
They are still reacting to these announcements. 
We owe it to our constituents.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I point out that we have two parties asking for this. 
As I said earlier, both of these requests are in order. 
That is not part of it at all.  
In my view, they do not meet the requirements for an emergency debate. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Since I spoke this morning two interesting things have happened in the House. 
I have not witnessed this before. 
During the election I had a speech, actually, on ``To whom does this seat belong?'' 
This is yet another argument in support of Senate reform.  
Ordinarily we would not ask the same question, but we are here now. 
Does he have permission to put the motion?  
I am reading into the record the proposed constitutional amendment of May 17, 1988. 
I will pick up on section 21.  
(a) is a Canadian citizen; 
(b) is of the full age of 18 years at the date of the election; 
(a) has been refused passage by the Senate, or 
(1) No appointment of a person 
(a) to be a Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada; 
This is a revised oath of allegiance for the Senate: 
Canadian International Development Agency 
Federal Business Development Bank 
Because it has not been accompanied by the threat of secession. 
It is now time that such attention was paid.  
I am sure members can see the flaw in that line of reasoning. 
The minister's statement completely confuses representation by province with representation by population. 
We are not trying to get equality of representation by population in the Senate. 
We want that in this House. 
I urged each province to put in place its own senatorial selection act. 
We can hardly do any worse. 
Round and round we go. 
In the opinion of the official opposition, the time for such lame excuses is over. 
It is time for leadership and action.  
That was the tamest of those suggestions.  
The Senate is often described as a Chamber of sober second thought. 
A lot of jokes have been made about that phrase. 
We have no great demands of the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I can provide examples. 
And what is the Reform Party now doing? 
It will probably decide to sue the Chief of First Nations.  
I had to make that point.  
I will now deal with the bill before us. 
I have already given an explanation of where all of the lands are situated. 
That vast expanse will now be under the jurisdiction of the Inuit.  
As I said earlier, they make up 80% of the population. 
The other 20% will not be left out. 
They can, of course, run for office; it will be done through universal suffrage. 
I have had several opportunities to visit Nunavut. 
I have been to Iqaluit twice. 
I take a special approach to visits. 
I do not tell them that I am an MP. 
Life in the Far North is hard. 
There are needs with respect to infrastructure, communications and education.  
All decisions used to be made in Ottawa. 
This will be a very significant change for these people.  
In my travels, I was also struck by the hospitality of the Inuit. 
They are very open people who like to discuss. 
It seemed to me that food prices were disproportionate. 
I will quote some statistics later on, in this regard. 
So, these people are in very extremely difficult circumstances. 
I think this was a fundamental need of theirs.  
There is much discussion at present. 
The capital of Nunavut is Iqaluit. 
The Bloc Quebecois strongly supports the bill. 
But there has never been such a large amount of land involved. 
There is a communication problem. 
In the past, all decisions came from Ottawa. 
I referred earlier to the geography of Nunavut. 
The other part, Nunavik, occupies the entire northern part of Quebec. 
Negotiations there are dragging out. 
They are making little progress, while things with Nunavut are reaching a conclusion. 
The western side, Inuvialuit, is already done. 
Nunavut is located in the middle and the east of the Northwest Territories. 
The lines are already pretty well drawn. 
There is possibly a dispute with Quebec that I must mention. 
I have trouble seeing the logic behind this land claim. 
I will now summarize the legislation. 
These powers will now be decentralized and decisions will be made in the Nunavut.  
The act already exists. 
The 1993 act also ratified an agreement. 
The same was done with the Nunavut Act. 
This is important, since we often have debates here on mining rights. 
The 1993 Nunavut Act was right on target.  
It also provided for hunting and fishing rights in that territory. 
So, hunting and fishing are very fundamental activities in Nunavut. 
It also established the legal and political framework for the establishment of the new territory. 
What did the commission do? 
It examined several political and administrative issues. 
At present, Nunavut is administered by Yellowknife, by the Northwest Territories.  
They have looked into this.  
I mentioned earlier that 600 to 700 jobs would be created. 
A referendum was actually held to select the capital of Nunavut. 
Three municipalities were in the running:
Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay. 
This bill makes a number of changes to the act.  
In 1993, the act provided that elections would be held after the territory was established. 
The legislative assembly will have 19 members. 
There will therefore be 19 electoral ridings in Nunavut. 
I think I am very lucky to represent the riding of Saint-Jean. 
This means that each riding will cover 100,000 square kilometres.  
This is huge as ridings go. 
The Inuit themselves admit this. 
Many government departments and agencies will be created in the territory's various communities. 
Approximately 20 are being considered. 
There will therefore be 28 communities. 
The east will come under the new legislative assembly. 
The Northwest Territories will go from 15 seats to 14.  
There are certain problems. 
I must admit, however, that I have certain reservations about the Senate. 
I must admit that there some thinking is still needed on this. 
We simply want it abolished. 
I would however like to make a point here. 
As I have said, we want to clarify our position a bit perhaps. 
At present, this is an irritant to us. 
The entire Senate, in fact, is an irritant. 
But if the Senate were elected, it could create other problems in our opinion. 
Who, in a given territory, would decide: the senator or the member of Parliament?  
It proposes the outright abolition of the Senate.  
There are other minor changes. 
We do not want a legislative and political void. 
The new government will have powers equivalent to those of existing territorial governments. 
It is anticipated that the whole transfer could be completed around the year 2009. 
So, there is a lot of work ahead. 
These leases will of course be transferred to the Nunavut territory.  
The authorities and powers of the interim commissioner will also be clarified. 
Mr. Anawak must be listening in. 
Ottawa decided who was the public servant and who was the commissioner. 
Things have changed significantly. 
Member spoke in Inuktitut.] 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The NDP has clearly stated its position with respect to the Senate. 
There is quite a bit of excitement surrounding the legislation. 
This is a very exciting time particularly for the people of Nunavut, for the Inuit.  
Clearly these issues must be closely explored in committee.  
Nunavut means ``our land''. 
The bill would facilitate giving meaning in history to that title. 
The government elected will be responsible to all citizens of the territory. 
Delgamuukw is an excellent case in point. 
This glaring omission merits serious attention in the months to come. 
Furthermore, the issue of the status of Nunavut in the Canadian charter remains unsettled. 
The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples stated: 
It is not a day by day countdown but a second by second countdown. 
That shows how much excitement there is surrounding the whole concept.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
The bill died on the order paper at that time. 
These recommendations were acted on in the following years.  
Its objective was to develop an agreement on dividing the territory. 
Thus the agreement failed and the group dissolved.  
The capital of the new region will be Iqaluit on Baffin Island.  
This amendment eliminates any uncertainty along these lines.  
This legislation helps to ensure that this will occur. 
Is the infrastructure going to be in place? 
Will financial assistance be provided and will there be enough of it? 
Nunavut will have a public government with Inuit and non-Inuit representation. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
We should all be proud of that.  
This is very significant for me. 
I was quite disappointed earlier today. 
I thought today we would be talking about the Nunavut Act amendments. 
I felt very cheated of this day. 
This is a very important day for me. 
It brings us one step closer to seeing the creation of our government. 
I think of the people who had no control over their own lives. 
They see so much hope in the new Nunavut government. 
It is being created out of hope. 
This legislation will allow for that.  
Bill C-39 is about hope. 
It provides a smooth transition to the larger new territory of Nunavut. 
I urge everyone in this House to not delay the passing of the act. 
The Inuit have had their own form of government since time began. 
When I talk about a community, I mean a group of people who live together. 
These communities had their own form of governing their own group of people. 
We have adapted over the last 50 years at a phenomenal rate. 
Justice is another initiative we will be watching very closely. 
It will give us an opportunity to deal with incarceration. 
I know we will not have all the infrastructure needed. 
They have some very good ideas.  
People are planning events now. 
This is not the Canadian way.  
I do not want to talk so much about Senate representation. 
I want to deal more with the actual Nunavut Act. 
That is just one little piece of the legislation. 
I do not think this is the time or the place. 
Doing the right thing is supporting this bill. 
Are they going to face a technicality? 
In the new government Inuktitut is going to be the working language. 
That is a new initiative on the part of the people of Nunavut. 
We have less than one year to go. 
We want to work and do all the great things. 
Just give us a chance to do so. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I know that it is very fragile in some areas.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:
We hope to work with each of those bodies. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:
We have had many delays over the years. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
The population of Nunavut will be over 24,000. 
We do not have the typical founding nations in the area. 
The challenge that is there for the people of Nunavut is great.  
I think they have a tremendous advantage. 
The hon. member said previously that they are not as fortunate. 
It is going to cost a lot of money. 
It did not become a province until 1905. 
I complimented them as I sat down to eat with them. 
She speaks from the heart. 
That is the kind of person that will make it go. 
I recently watched a television program on this topic. 
They talked about the tourism industry and the ongoing excitement. 
Between now and April 1, 1999 there will be a great deal of excitement. 
I am very proud to wish her well.  
That would put them in first place again. 
The member's people would choose their own representative in the red house. 
They would say go for it. 
I say the same thing to the member.  
They will have an elected assembly. 
She is a member of the House in which she represents her constituency well. 
She should go back to her people and tell them to do something brand new. 
They should bring in the very first elected senator from their territory. 
The member has a lot of good things going for her. 
Let us add to that a free election to the Senate. 
Nothing but good could come of this.  
The Reform Party supports this move. 
We know there is a tremendous cost involved. 
There is a tremendous cost involved with many things. 
An hon. gentleman asked a question about the tourism industry. 
If I had time that is where I would be going. 
We want them to preserve their language. 
Canadians can be and will be proud of the member. 
Madam Speaker, I listened very carefully to what the Reform member had to say. 
He mentioned a band in which there was a particular role for women. 
They have a very special vision of their new territory.  
We should all realize that.  
This new territory will be very special for the people who live there. 
The Inuit people of western Canada will be looking to Nunavut. 
The Eskimo of Alaska will be looking to Nunavut as a special Inuit based territory. 
Today is a great day. 
They have been listening to their member of parliament speak. 
What did they hear this morning? 
And this is my question for the member. 
The member ended his speech with the same sort of comments. 
They are given a generous allocation of days from which they could pick. 
One of my colleagues says there is one this week. 
Why did they take up time on this wonderful day for the people of Nunavut?  
I do not put on a sham when I talk. 
I have never really had that happen before. 
I wished the hon. colleague well. 
Is he doubting that I wish her well? 
I find that rather distasteful. 
It would be a wonderful day. 
Over the past they have developed their own style of government. 
They should be the ones who make the selection. 
That is not taking a pot-shot against anybody. 
This was a condemnation of me as a speaker who came to congratulate them. 
I have read a great deal about the background. 
It was Santa Claus and I got a nice T-shirt. 
I certainly would not agree with degradation from the hon. member opposite. 
Madam Speaker, I would simply repeat my question. 
I apologize if the member feels personally upset about it.  
The government opposite refused to do that.  
It chose to do that. 
It chose to take away the celebration of this day. 
It was not me but the government opposite.  
I mean it from my heart. 
I do not care what questions they want to throw at me. 
It is a dead issue. 
The Nunavut is not a dead issue. 
I wish them well. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
We should all rejoice on this great day. 
And here we are creating a territory that will be even larger than that province.  
We are not stagnant. 
We have not remained the same as some people sometimes pretend. 
The process we are starting today will contribute to that.  
His was a fine speech.  
Most Canadians will have trouble understanding his reasoning. 
Simply because it is not all that logical.  
What happened a little earlier today is this. 
It has done a miserable job of doing that. 
He refused to do so. 
That is what upsets me as a member of this House.  
That is how I think. 
I will get back to the leader of the Reform Party in a moment. 
We heard the Reform Party's comments on constitutional reform. 
He campaigned against the accord, pontificated from afar as he did. 
The accord was eventually defeated. 
I campaigned for it every single day, rain or shine. 
You might just learn something.  
The member across seems to be sorry that we are quoting his leader. 
Is there something slightly inconsistent with that kind of reasoning? 
Is there something just slightly wrong? 
Do you know what is wrong? 
They are Reformers and it is the Reform Party. 
That is what is wrong, as the secretary of state just so eloquently pointed out. 
It is a little hard to understand.  
Maybe I should have but I have not done it yet. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to remind the hon. member that he is wrong in his statement. 
In the last Parliament he did advocate the- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I want to tell the hon. member- 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask that you seek quorum in the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is a quorum at this point. 
The hon. member across says to listen to the people. 
They would say a whole variety of things about those people making false accusations.  
Those kinds of remarks against senior citizens are inappropriate. 
The hon. member across never did withdraw. 
Who are the kind of people who presently sit in the Senate? 
Let me give a few examples of the excellent Canadians who sit there. 
The hon. member should remember that as well when he criticizes members elsewhere.  
It is the people across the way who refused to improve it.  
I am speaking of people who have sat recently in the Senate. 
Oliver Cromwell, the only dictator ever to have taken over England. 
That is how he defends himself, giving speeches and referring to dictators.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, that was really an enjoyable little speech. 
Where have they improved? 
It did not know how to run this country.  
They cannot listen to him. 
That is what is going to happen.  
They will not be getting reappointed, I can tell them that. 
They will get elected because people will have the right to do that.  
That is the way we will have this country run. 
That is why we are here. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to some of this. 
I am a little bewildered by what the hon. member is seeking to get.  
I am not questioning the honesty of the hon. member. 
I am sure there is honesty in him notwithstanding those inappropriate remarks.  
That is what it is about.  
Yes, this House is to hold governments accountable. 
That is wrong and I will keep saying it when it occurs.  
This happens to be, notwithstanding the member's comments, the greatest country in the world. 
It has not been destroyed. 
It is still the best. 
That is what is going to happen. 
That is why it will get better.  
It is his leader who invoked the words of a dictator in his speech. 
Is there not something wrong with that reasoning? 
This country is working and it is working well. 
That is exactly what this bill is doing. 
It is creating a new territory to make the federation better. 
That is one of the reasons why we are debating this bill.  
That is my wish to the good people of Nunavut. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Do not impose the mistakes that the Liberals and the Tories have made for decades. 
Do not impose that mistake on this new government. 
Give it a chance. 
It was there long before we came along. 
There have been changes from time to time to the system. 
The age requirement has been altered. 
The distribution between provinces has been altered. 
There have been changes made to that process.  
You missed the most important one.  
I campaigned for the election of senators. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The Nunavut Act has made a major change in the perception of our country. 
The design of the northern territories- 
I still view it that way. 
People have been bantering about the issue of the Senate today. 
Debating the Senate has no place in this act. 
Let Nunavut prepare itself with as much time as it has. 
It has less than 12 months to prepare itself to govern a gigantic region. 
Nunavut's communities and peoples have diverse needs. 
Give Nunavut the time to prepare. 
Now is not the time. 
We wasted many hours of debate today, hours that could have been fruitful. 
Dialogue could have taken place for the people of Nunavut. 
I raise the example of governance by consensus. 
The democratic system was designed from that. 
Those concepts and perceptions were adopted. 
That is what Canada has to do today. 
If we are going to debate we have to open up these walls. 
This vessel has to be re-envisioned. 
The legislative structures of our provinces should also be re-envisioned.  
We should find better means and better ways. 
We could create a circle.  
It persevered a test. 
It is a symbol of the strength of this country. 
Why could we not use that as a symbol of the unity of this country? 
I do not think a partisan setting is the right place.  
Referring to aboriginal people as being uncivilized is untrue. 
The industrial age is poisoning and polluting our world. 
Find out where the future of our country and our world is going. 
Question who really was uncivilized. 
In future years we will see them debating national issues. 
They will have seats recognizing their territories in this place and in the other place. 
They will truly share their view and their dialogue which is rightfully theirs.  
You cannot stifle those people.  
It came to pass in 1998. 
They never did anything wrong. 
That is a right we have in the democratic structure of this country.  
For us to debate other issues aside from Nunavut is wasting their time. 
They need time to prepare. 
Hopefully, in passing this legislation Nunavut can prepare itself.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
This amendment only makes sense. 
He recommends the governor general. 
The two just do not go together.  
We could not agree more. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The government then cancelled Chief Sparrow's presentation altogether. 
When I asked her who would convict him, she had no answer.  
The responsibility lies with the Prime Minister's office and with this government. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The only issue on the speeches was simply the time factor. 
All those who were to speak were given strict time limits. 
In fact this is a theme dear to the present government. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
No such agreement should apply to Saskatchewan without its explicit consent''.  
Canadian corporations would not be extended the same right.  
Members of the Reform Party cannot wait for the MAI. 
The MAI would deliver a two tier health care system.  
Toronto Star columnist Rosemary Spiers said last Thursday: 
Canada will not sign the MAI this month, we are told, in Paris. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
And they are bizarre. 
They are being taken from a draft. 
Canada now has 54 investment agreements which are bilateral. 
We have one trilateral agreement. 
No health care has been put in jeopardy. 
No education has been put in jeopardy. 
Our treatment of native peoples has not been threatened in any way.  
History shows that Canada works better with rules than it does without rules. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Two of those alleged attackers are young offenders. 
In fact, they are an insult to the very notion of basic criminal justice.  
We need to find answers to basic questions before we offer solutions. 
The first questions we need to answer are the ones that begin with why.  
Why are these young people clearly unable to identify with the victims of their crimes? 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt but the hon. member's time has expired.  
We are very sensitive to that.  
The member has asked for a national study of group violence by teenagers. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
We do not know. 
Consultations are required so we know what we are dealing with. 
We do not know either where this potentially polluting material would be disposed of.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I have to interrupt the hon. member. 
The time allotted has run out.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
As well, two rounds of public consultations were held.  
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
My objection to this recommendation is twofold. 
My second concern is what I call the cascade effect. 
Investors are free in this country to invest in foreign assets. 
The minister stated that he would study this with his provincial counterparts. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7 p.m.)
