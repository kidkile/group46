Tuesday, March 2, 1999 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The first petition has to do with human rights. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
I really want to touch on three things. 
That is a message to which certainly the government has failed to react.  
There is the loss of brain power. 
I have a son who teaches at Princeton. 
He was a Rhodes scholar who could not get a job in Canada. 
I have a daughter who is an architect in Norway. 
She could not get a job in Canada. 
I have a young daughter who was recruited to Holland. 
That is what we are finding. 
We talked about paycheques. 
What are we getting from the deductions on the paycheques? 
Again it is pay more, get less. 
We have less health care. 
We have an EI system that is just not working.  
They know that and they are upset by it.  
The result is that young people see no hope in the country. 
Small businesses see no reason why they should grow and provide jobs. 
I would like to concentrate on our position in the world. 
Where are we in the world? 
I have been fortunate to have been travelling for close to 40 years. 
I have travelled to just about every country in the world. 
Canada's influence is not what it used to be. 
One was the debt. 
Second, we cannot have taxes like we have. 
Third, and most important of all, we do not have a plan. 
There is no plan. 
The Canadian government is in a state of denial. 
The Liberals love to brag. 
They want to keep their spirits high. 
That hits home and that hits home hard. 
Those are hard, cold facts.  
Let us look at the real indicators of what is happening to us. 
In a healthy economy there is virtually full employment. 
I have mentioned the Canadian dollar. 
Our standard of living is falling. 
Our unemployment rate is double that of our U.S. cousins. 
The government has nothing to be proud of in the budget. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the member's speech very much. 
Our place in the world has diminished over the last several years.  
There are 11 quarter sections of land being developed in housing. 
There has been a huge increase in what is happening.  
I meet with the executives of those companies. 
The advantages are obvious.  
That is the big problem.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Already we hear a yeah over there. 
A million and a half jobs.  
One member over there says a million and a half jobs. 
I would like the hon. member to reflect the reality in balancing the books.  
Mr. Speaker, the government has played a shell game. 
They continue to shuffle money from one portfolio to another. 
That debt has not gone away. 
Putting maybe $3 billion a year on that will take forever.  
There is nothing here to brag about. 
That is the real issue.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
As a matter a fact they are going south to the United States.  
Would you agree with this statement?  
Would he agree with this statement.  
That is what we have to turn around.  
That is the big question.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Another member sitting over there is bragging about that.  
I want to put a reality test before us. 
I thought I should check this out.  
The Prime Minister is claiming that he created all the jobs in Canada. 
The fact of the matter is that it is private industry.  
As usual they do not like what I am saying. 
We will go into that in a moment.  
Anthony Ostler of Toronto wrote: 
We are rapidly becoming a second rate country.  
This is from one of our young people. 
Maybe I will have to pursue greener tax pastures elsewhere''.  
This is a sad but true unsolicited commentary from a Toronto individual. 
My mother who is watching today will remember. 
In fact, the situation has gotten worse. 
So things have not really changed that much which is very sad.  
The tax rate is too high. 
Some hon. members know this. 
We have to deal with these issues.  
They are kidding themselves because this is not the case. 
What has the government offered these young people in return? 
It is a facade of this government. 
This Liberal government has got the wrong attitude with this whole issue. 
It has a lot to do with that. 
There are other things I would have liked to have seen in this budget. 
Very little, if anything, has been done to address that. 
It has not created jobs unless it has been at the cost of the taxpayer. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the member. 
My question is very specific. 
The difference is that when we talk, they are not listening.  
Something else that was said here is important to note. 
This is not just about budgets in the House of Commons. 
That was an important issue.  
Their affront on young people in Vancouver at the APEC hearings has been unacceptable. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
That is the problem. 
What can we say? 
The cancer societies have been in a fortunate situation in Canada. 
Research is the foundation of any modern health care system. 
It is not an extra, it is not some sort of a luxury. 
It is an integral part of any efficient, modern health care system. 
We were able to devote $11 billion in that direction. 
Research generates new insights into human biology and disease processes. 
This is so important in all our health institutions.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her questions. 
I am talking here about a health care system now and for the future. 
Where is the support for the NRC? 
That is the support our young people need. 
Our young people need the millennium scholarships. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I speak of health care.  
I listened to the hon. member. 
We were borrowing almost a $1 billion a week at that time. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I only have time for a short question. 
The negativism from that side is of great concern to me. 
Let us have some optimism here.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Often care was not sought until it was too late to save a patient. 
It is good to remember those times. 
Yes, it cost him dearly.  
Yes, we Canadians have taken a lot for granted. 
To that extent we have been fortunate in Canada. 
That is going to take more than just money. 
Today the future is bright. 
Now we are able to look to the future with confidence.  
Rather than waiting to treat, we are intervening to prevent. 
We are being proactive. 
We are assisting pregnant women. 
We are also dealing with issues like contaminated foods before they happen. 
We are providing management for the control of toxic substances. 
There is much more to do. 
This budget will help to do that.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to this debate for some time. 
The Liberal government has destroyed our health care system. 
The Canadian government has put the health care system in this position. 
Now it is spending millions of dollars of taxpayers' money in a damage control campaign. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The parliamentary secretary has one minute to respond.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
How proud is the member of those facts that have been created by her government? 
That is what distinguishes us from the Reform Party.  
It would scrap the Canada Health Act. 
It would bring in user fees and American style medicine. 
This party says no. 
We believe that by working together we can solve the problems.  
Internationally all countries are facing problems. 
Nobody has found the perfect answer. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
In the next five years it will invest $12.5 billion. 
As a Canadian, how could she be proud of that?  
Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is factually incorrect. 
That will also give predictable and stable funding to the provinces which deliver those services.  
Today the debt and the debt to GDP ratio are on a downward trend. 
The tax burden is being reduced, particularly for the neediest. 
That is a real commitment and those are the facts.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Quebec is in mourning. 
Our unemployed are weeping. 
The Liberal plot was revealed, it was a plot against Quebec. 
Members should imagine the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs trying to talk about figures. 
Just as here in the House, no one understood him. 
There is a word for that, but I cannot say it.  
You can say it is pillage.  
Members should look at what is happening in the Gaspe and North Shore areas. 
What did the Minister of Finance announce to the unemployed? 
This is the reality.  
Let us take a look at the social and economic impacts of that reform. 
This hurts regional development and it results in people leaving the regions.  
I have a suggestion. 
This surplus is still being underestimated.  
He is not a sovereigntist either.  
This government says we made no suggestions. 
That it does not know what to do about EI. 
I have news for it.  
Second, increase in maximum number of benefit weeks from 45 to 50.  
In another, he would be entitled to only 17 weeks. 
Try to explain that.  
This plan is impossible. 
Last year, there was not a single line, so it is a vast improvement. 
What a nice show of transparency on the minister's part. 
Let us now turn our attention to the future WTO negotiations. 
Agriculture is the first item on the agenda. 
It is these three ministers who will represent Quebec's interests.  
Needless to say I am concerned. 
It is time we talk about sovereignty. 
To the people of Lotbiniere and of Quebec I say we have to mobilize. 
That project is Quebec's sovereignty.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
It is pretty rough around the edges. 
Can he explain that to me?  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
You have borrowed from the employment insurance fund.  
I wonder why there is shouting from the other side. 
We listened to them; let them listen to us. 
Let them show us some respect. 
That is now past. 
Now he claims to have never heard of such a thing. 
Odd, since he was there. 
We don't want charity. 
We pay $30 billion in tax money.  
What do the hon. members across the way have to reply to that? 
It does not swell my confidence at all. 
We have a hard time understanding him, here in the House.  
Education, health and municipalities are provincial. 
It is easy to treat us as separatists. 
When were we consulted about investing only $150 million? 
The Prime Minister did not even honour his signature. 
And what about social union: a fine bit of blackmail. 
``We need you in the next election. 
We need you to fight the sovereignists. 
Do people find that fair and equitable?  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Everyone understands that this government is centralizing. 
Everyone, except the federal Liberals, understands that this government makes a mockery of provincial jurisdictions. 
There is a problem. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
This was a show of solidarity. 
We realize that the federal system is making people leave the Atlantic region in droves.  
People from that region showed more common sense than Quebeckers. 
They got rid of them. 
They will take care of them at the next election.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the budget debate. 
In a vast majority of cases it has been very successful. 
We owe Canadians a debt of thanks.  
We have been able to deal with the deficit which we inherited. 
The first fundamental area around which we must invest is wealth generation. 
This project has already created jobs in Fredericton. 
It is important for us to take our place in line as we reinvest. 
We have dealt with the deficit and are dealing with the debt. 
In fact, at that time the opposition said that the government did not cut enough. 
This is very important to me as I represent CFB Gagetown in my constituency. 
We have invested $400 million in the criminal justice system.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
These were absolute distortions. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would invite the hon. member for Kootenay-Columbia to put the question.  
The transfers to the provinces around health are very complicated. 
I am sure the member from British Columbia would welcome that decision. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I want to share some of their views.  
They were pleased with that. 
I want to share with colleagues a very interesting fact. 
Most people would say that is not a whole lot, and it is not really. 
That is a whole lot of money. 
It all depends on from what end we look at the decision.  
Some people have tried to suggest that the transfers for health are not terribly significant. 
Of course that is not true. 
There are significant investments in health which are seen extremely positively.  
I want to make sure they understand that they are not just coming from me. 
I quote from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada: 
Let us go to another organization, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada: 
With this new funding, we will be able to add eight more centres of excellence.  
That is one of the points we must remember. 
In the budget the government has built upon previous budgets. 
University of Toronto president, Robert Pichard, had this to say: 
The University of Toronto is very pleased with the federal budget. 
This is the third federal budget that has strengthened our cause. 
We are very grateful for the new support.  
The Canada Foundation for Innovation said: 
I have mentioned those. 
Creating knowledge, what have we done in that area? 
We have invested in the Canadian Foundation for Innovation. 
Let us look at the second category of disseminating knowledge. 
Let us talk about commercialization knowledge.  
Let us talk about supporting le soutien de l'emploi, surtout chez les jeunes. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
This ad denies Canadians the right to know or the right to express themselves. 
Will the member ask his government to stop that ad?  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. 
I would have hoped he might have been a bit more objective. 
That is exactly what is happening.  
In one year it would cost $5.4 billion. 
Does Reform not get it?  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I know he will take responsibility for that.  
I would like to quickly touch on two issues. 
One is the $5.4 billion per year. 
I have a question about research and development. 
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Mr. Speaker, I have three points to make. 
When we came into power in 1993 the debt was $190 billion. 
It took us about four years to get it down to zero. 
This is good news for Manitoba. 
This is good news for every province and each of the three territories.  
We are not pie in the sky. 
We will not promise something we cannot sustain and then have to remove. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Those figures are shocking.  
This budget fails Canadian children again.  
This budget also fails the homeless. 
The federal budget is a national disgrace on housing and homelessness. 
I will recall those words for him. 
Anything less, and this budget is much less, is a devastating shame.  
The budget also fails Canadians on health care. 
Let us put the so-called health budget in perspective. 
More than half of that was in health care funding.  
That is what they want us to remember about this budget.  
It is like a wage bonus instead of a wage increase. 
It is a one time fix that really leaves us no further ahead.  
I went through every page. 
I heard a Liberal member earlier talk about the sacrifices that have been made.  
There is nothing in this budget that will help those people.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
She mentioned the gap widening between the rich and the poor. 
These people do not get water. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
How many children go to school hungry? 
What impression did my colleague form in touring the country? 
They found the rents were too high for their low wages. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
There are two criteria by which one must address any federal budget. 
I will acknowledge that and my colleagues have acknowledged that. 
This is truly a lesson in underachievement. 
The deficit was gone and enough surplus money was there to make a difference. 
Let us for a second put the health budget in perspective. 
Members of the government keep repeating $11.5 billion. 
That is what they want us to remember about the budget. 
It is like a wage bonus, instead of a wage increase. 
It is a one time fix that leaves us no further ahead. 
There is some repentance in this budget.  
It will not happen at this rate. 
The private control of health care is increasing at a rapid rate. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Would the hon. member care to comment on my observations in that regard?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from my colleague. 
It is a very important issue.  
That certainly is an important issue that the government has failed to address. 
The other issue my colleague raised concerned economic disparities. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Cambridge.  
At all of my consultations I distributed two budget charts. 
I am pleased to report that my consultations produced the following results.  
First, paying down the debt was the recommendation most often made. 
Virtually everyone thought that some form of action was necessary. 
Other tax changes included cutting employment insurance premiums. 
The 1999 budget takes action on three fronts. 
First, it maintains sound economic and financial management. 
Second, it invests in key economic and social priorities. 
Third, it provides tax relief and improves tax fairness.  
The budget goes even further. 
It acknowledges that another key issue for any nation is its national debt. 
A key element of this strategy is a debt repayment plan.  
The current plan contains a contingency reserve of $3 billion each year. 
This funding marks the largest investment this government has ever made. 
However, the commitment to strengthening health care does not stop there. 
This great nation is more than a balance sheet''.  
We are building today for a better tomorrow.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of quick questions for the hon. member.  
I would like her to respond to what Stats Canada has said. 
Now we have 1.5 million. 
These miracle workers over there have not solved that problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for quoting me some statistics. 
I would like to quote him some statistics as well.  
It seems that in 1998 453,000 jobs were created. 
Another 87,000 jobs were created in January. 
The statistics prove it.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
I have the same great respect for him as he has for me.  
I point out to my hon. colleague across the way that there is no surplus. 
I suggest the member look at the budget sheets we have. 
Income goes in under the consolidated revenue fund and expenses are made. 
There is no surplus fund. 
There is no reserve fund. 
I believe the media feed these things that are not true. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
That is the way to keep them down.  
I submit the Minister of Finance is on the right track.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
I begin by congratulating the hon. minister on his sixth budget. 
This is the second year in a row for a balanced budget. 
Medicare is one of our most cherished social programs. 
The commitment to strengthen health care does not end there. 
They want more accountability. 
The third most important element of the 1999 budget is tax relief. 
This budget proves that. 
As resources become available, the government will provide as much tax relief as possible. 
This is the responsible way.  
Canada is doing well. 
We are staying the course. 
We are continuing to pay down our national debt. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I notice that certain statistics were cited about jobs that were created. 
I tend to look at what is really happening in the area.  
We end up with a vicious circle. 
People are out of work. 
This perhaps leads to health problems, depression, family breakdown. 
I ask the hon. member, what is being done? 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for that question.  
I understand the situation is not the same in other parts of the country.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Would the member not agree that that was basically the premise of the federal government? 
I contributed to the unemployment fund. 
He should recognize there is a confidence among Canadians in this government. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
The chronic unemployment problem in a number of this country's regions remains unchanged. 
The excessive tax burden remains unchanged. 
The battle against poverty remains unchanged. 
The issues around proper use of the employment insurance fund remain unchanged.  
What did this government offer them, in its budget? 
The other votes will be paid out in stages. 
The floor is raised to $15 billion and will stay there.  
An overall plan is needed to get the health care system working again. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Here we are on the brink of making history. 
Yet there is nothing in the budget that made any real commitment to that.  
I do not feel that businessmen go on the if prospect. 
Other areas have done it. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
The superport would certainly have been great compensation for this closure.  
It is an important factor. 
The member has probably heard a lot about it in his own riding. 
People are on waiting lists, waiting for serious operations. 
Nurses and other workers are overworked. 
We must take into account the aging population and inflation. 
Unfortunately that is the case for Nova Scotia as well.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member referred to the cash transfers that we outlined in the budget. 
It has been paid into a trust to permit that very thing. 
They are not separate.  
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I take them into account. 
I know about tax points. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Instead, the budget is devastating to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Did it make education more accessible for students? 
There is a crisis in the emergency wards across Canada. 
In other words, they are going to cap the transfers at $15 billion. 
They have put very little of that back with this budget.  
There needs to be a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the health care system. 
Some of these questions are of particular interest to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Is that going to help the poorer provinces of Canada? 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Equalization is one of the fundamental tenets on which Confederation is based. 
How can we do it without money?  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Is everybody not getting the same, equally?  
Mr. Speaker, obviously the member does not understand the function of equalization. 
The function of equalization is for the well to do provinces of Canada.  
The CHST is not equalization. 
You don't understand.  
There is no way to do it without money.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
There is an Ontario dominated caucus with Ontario dominated priorities. 
We have a two tier system of job creation. 
We have a two tier system of highways in Newfoundland. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
This $11.5 billion is not borrowed money. 
I ask members to keep that in mind.  
Canadians rallied to the cause. 
Canadians embraced the deficit reduction strategies of the government. 
In 1998-99 Canada will balance the books or better. 
Canadians point with pride to this particular social program. 
Canadians have been increasingly worried about the future of health care. 
I am very pleased to see the minister responding in this way.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague's speech with interest. 
It has a common theme. 
Liberal members always want to talk about what it will be like in the future. 
They never talk about their record.  
Let us talk about their record for a second. 
Liberals cut $21 billion out of health care. 
Fourteen hundred doctors left Canada in the last two years. 
Our record speaks for itself. 
Very clearly we have done the job. 
That party would dismantle the health care system in this country. 
That party would take apart the very foundation that Canadians have in place.  
We are doing the job. 
We are continuing to do the job. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
That speaks for itself.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
It is clearly $525 million better than we had before this budget. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
This health component of the budget reflects more than the amount itself. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
Together there is no end to what we can accomplish.  
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
Unfortunately every noble revolution has its martyrs. 
Young Canadians need a government that will lower their taxes. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
This is a village known for its literary traditions.  
History at this level is the history of those very individuals who built this nation. 
Books like this cement our sense of being Canadian.  
1999 CANADA WINTER GAMES 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
The hon. member for Delta-South Richmond.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
More than 97% of the voters rejected the treaty as it now stands. 
Only two and one-half per cent of the voters, 76 people, supported the deal.  
People are concerned about this treaty. 
The people most affected by this deal have spoken. 
Is the Liberal travelling road show to the west listening? 
Is this government listening?  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
The meeting reinforced how proud I am to be a Canadian. 
The hon. member for Quebec.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Quebeckers deserve referendum peace. 
They deserve a government that looks after the economy, instead of thinking up referendum questions.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
As a former Liberal, the decline of Canada is a bitter pill to swallow. 
I deeply wish things were different. 
Does that not say it all.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Such results are not mere chance. 
DOWNTOWN EAST SIDE COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Will the government make a commitment to these basic needs? 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
I wish Karine many other experiences such as this one. 
Bravo, Karine, and thank you.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
He was received, let me say, with a standing ovation. 
1999 CANADA WINTER GAMES

Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
So I am doing what the minister should have done. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There have been major tax cuts since we have been here.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is the lowest in 50 years. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
StatsCan has confirmed it. 
Canadians are now paying the highest taxes that they have ever paid in history. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, earth to the minister. 
Why is the minister running away from the question?  
Why is this government discriminating against single income families? 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
This resolution asked the government to negotiate government to government. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The millennium scholarships represent a political decision to ensure visibility.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I can assure you of one thing. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is perfectly normal for parties to speak to each other. 
I want to adopt a constructive attitude. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I address my question to the Prime Minister.  
Does the Prime Minister share these concerns? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Will the Prime Minister show some leadership here? 
Team Canada trade missions take advantage of that access. 
The nation has been rid of its deficit and we already- 
The hon. member for Compton-Stanstead.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We have a very high maintenance level. 
We are in the process of developing a strategy with respect to their replacement.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
One would think they would pay the same amount of taxes, right? 
No, in fact they do not. 
Why does the Prime Minister think that is fair? 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Let me recite them for the member.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Under the 1999 budget that discrimination gets even worse. 
Families are having to live on credit now.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
So things are moving along.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
What kind of government has that little respect for stay at home parents?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
These reforms we began from the very first day that we took office.  
The hon. minister, if he wishes, may finish his response.  
We will hear the minister.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Is this not an inhuman, heartless and irresponsible act?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would remind the minister that deportation is the federal government's responsibility.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
It is so recognized internationally.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It makes no sense. 
It simply is not fair.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This has been part of our philosophy from day one when we took office. 
This is why we have targeted it in areas of priority.  
We have had to be prudent in our tax cuts. 
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Why has the minister misrepresented the contents of this letter? 
Why is he refusing to negotiate on the basis of this motion? 
It is a matter of good faith.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Yesterday, I was open- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development still has some time left.  
The minister only has a few seconds left.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
The legitimacy of the Senate is now in tatters.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not applying and never would.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we voted for a complete reform of the Senate. 
Some people opposed the Charlottetown agreement when we wanted to have an elected Senate.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
The hon. member for Battlefords-Lloydminster.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This has been part of our quest and we have achieved it.  
They are the ones who need it most. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
What kind of help is that?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Lack of consultation always leads to confrontation. 
Why did the minister choose this route?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The chief is working with his community. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Let us see what some of this money is being spent on. 
I would ask the hon. member to go to his question.  
They are there to serve the needs of Canadians.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Are the increases always going to be there? 
We need to know.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This government believes strongly in preventing illness.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we made immediate contact with the family. 
We operated quickly to talk with Mr. Hudon. 
We have raised the issue with the Mexican authorities. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
There are critical situations in New Brunswick, with a provincial government which-

Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
The person who is unemployed does not pay taxes. 
We are very proud of our job creation record.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The Canadian Wheat Board is still in their sights.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, no we are not prepared to sacrifice supply management. 
We are working very hard with the industry. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, we have taken several positive steps. 
We want to keep our brightest and our best in Canada. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
This new allocation is to provide immediate support for advanced health research.  
These amounts total $376 million for initiatives to create knowledge.  
Budget '99 is indeed the best budget of them all. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
A round of extravagant spending has begun.  
How can the member for Winnipeg North-St. 
How can he justify his government's spending $35,000 to duplicate structures?  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
He has only raised grave doubts as to the duplication of the efforts. 
In other words, it appears to be more about a wounded ego than anything else. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the member for Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Even the NDP premier of Saskatchewan applauded budget '99.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
I hope the member opposite will obey the rule of law.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Maybe they will be quiet enough to hear it.  
What all this obscures is what budgets should be about. 
In short, this is what budgets should be all about. 
Do not take my word for it. 
Myth number one is that the Liberals have not increased taxes. 
Unfortunately even Canadian Airlines is perpetuating this myth.  
Just ask the industry minister. 
According to him, high taxes are good for business. 
The geniuses at Revenue Canada decided to change that format. 
In 1980 a person making $10,505 paid no income tax. 
Is there a pattern developing with this?  
That is neither prudent nor responsible. 
There is no victory for the official opposition in that statement. 
This budget was supposed to make the lives of Canadians better. 
It was supposed to increase their standard of living. 
We pay more taxes and get less health care. 
This is obviously reversed.  
Why hasn't Ottawa ever suffered? 
Because it does not have to. 
That's why this budget is a national insult''.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the hon. member should ask that question. 
I asked the question who is the bracket creep some four years ago. 
It is interesting that the member raised that issue.  
Mr. Speaker, I see you are on the edge of your seat. 
Are you having a problem? 
Maybe the House could help you out with it. 
I am not sure what the problem is.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The problem is we have another question coming.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
We are investing in Canadians, rural Canadians. 
I know this member represents a rural part of Canada. 
Does the member for Prince George-Peace River agree with his colleague from Macleod?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, in that case I will try to be brief. 
Obviously the Liberals must get something right in their budget. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think he would like to correct the record on that. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know how to match that enlightened exchange. 
They know how to balance a budget and to meet a payroll. 
One of my friends from Mississauga South claims to be an accountant. 
My condolences to him.  
These people should know how to read a set of financial documents. 
Apparently they do not.  
I have spent the last several years of my life studying public finance. 
That has to be the starting point of this debate. 
There are some tax increases which he calls spending cuts. 
They know it through their experience.  
They see it when they go to the emergency rooms. 
That is just as a result of bracket creep. 
The government has added 1.2 million people on to the tax rolls. 
Let us just do some simple math here. 
Liberals may have to get out their calculators to follow it. 
I do not need to make the argument because grassroots Canadians make it every day. 
I just read about the federal Liberal budget. 
As an employee I have no deductions. 
We are living from paycheque to paycheque and have no savings. 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member from Calgary.  
We are all allowed to make mistakes. 
I ask the hon. member the same question I asked another member. 
He is a person who represents a very urban area. 
Does the hon. member believe in it?  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
The document he would be looking for is called ``Taxes and Health Care:
A Prebudget Submission of the Official Opposition''. 
We go through in some great detail the kind of choices we would make.  
Yes, we would spend more on health care, more than the government has. 
We would do it not by raising overall spending.  
They say how can you increase one program without increasing overall spending? 
The word is called priorities. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I listened to the member for Calgary Southeast. 
Not once in his remarks did he offer any constructive alternative. 
Leadership is all about dealing in hope. 
I am not proud. 
Let us be candid. 
We cannot be proud of those numbers. 
What is the trajectory of where this government's financial plan is headed? 
I believe the Minister of Finance has the trajectory going the right way.  
We are beginning to replenish the health care system in this country.  
We all know how fragile economic confidence is. 
I agree with the member for Calgary Southeast when it comes to comprehensive tax reform. 
They are all coming home. 
That to me comes from an economic climate that is improving.  
Do we have to do more? 
We have to do a lot more, especially in Atlantic Canada. 
I would do it in a second. 
I know the Reform Party calls that pork barrelling. 
The fiscal framework is moving in the right direction. 
The health plan is being replenished. 
There are actually little sparks of hope for comprehensive tax reform in this budget. 
That is not leadership. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Let us look at the Liberal record since 1993. 
We have also seen the overall taxes increased by this government by 40- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Speaker, it is not rhetoric. 
There has been a cost. 
The member is right. 
I have acknowledged that he is right. 
That is a very principal point.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The Liberals are the ones responsible for the mess in the health care system.  
Is that cause for hope?  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
We know very well what our challenge is in Quebec. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Does he not think it is time we started- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):
Since we entered this debate some 11 years ago a lot of changes have occurred.  
I can understand why because there were no choices, no options.  
What did the pundits say last year? 
This year we had a second balanced budget. 
Of course the right wing pundits were out there saying ``That is not good enough. 
Here are the criticisms that I have heard so far about the budget. 
This is a very telling tale. 
Now we are at the point where we can see some hope. 
Canadians are showing that. 
We are having debates now, serious debates about where we are going. 
The fact is that we have balanced budgets.  
I think that is a great debate because my riding is a big rural riding. 
That is what I want to do in rural parts of Canada.  
I understand why members of the Reform Party jumped ship. 
The next issue really is the future. 
We have been through the past as opposition members. 
We are now entering into a very key time in our country's development.  
We are basically going on our seventh year. 
I think we need to start talking about where we want this country to go.  
Let me give members an example of what I mean. 
Some people talk about emergency procedures. 
Where I come from we have neither. 
We do not have lineups because we do not have hospitals. 
We need a national rural health care plan in Canada. 
I was in his riding two years ago. 
His infrastucture needs and his abilities to create an economy are the same as mine. 
He is a long way from getting where he wants to go.  
Let us start talking about hope. 
Hope is the ability of governments to have flexibility. 
It is the ability of governments to decide what their priorities are.  
We know where the Reform Party is at. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
The lone Tory who is here says never. 
I am not too worried about that, quite frankly. 
They just do not get it.  
Let us get serious about why they are in opposition. 
The thing that is important to me is the vision of the Liberal Party. 
I look forward to the debate. 
We think you are way off base''.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this member says that Canadians have bought into this government's vision. 
Let me remind him of one thing. 
I became equally disgusted with the fiscal irresponsibility of this Liberal government. 
That is why I came to Reform.  
This member then tells us that Conrad Black is to blame for the deficit. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Kenora-Rainy River.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
Mr. Speaker, I was not blaming Conrad Black. 
God bless him, he is here. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
I would like to reassure him. 
What kind of hope can they have? 
If the member can answer that, the fishermen in Gaspe will understand.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
There was a necessity in this country to deal with behavioural change. 
We will be proactive enough. 
This country is working because it is sharing its resources to help have not regions. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
I sat over there when the Tories sat over here. 
Day after day they kept increasing this front bench. 
That is the kind- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Why do the Liberals not mention that?  
Why do the Liberals not talk about the poverty of children? 
Why do the Liberals not do something about that? 
Quit giving away free flags. 
The Liberals should start thinking about the dumb things they are doing with money. 
They never talk about the dumb things they do. 
They should start mentioning a few of those things. 
Look at the public accounts.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
However, things are not all that rosy, for roses have thorns. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois have revealed the real figures. 
The budget did not change anything. 
Quebeckers and Canadians are always paying more for less. 
Once again, the government is collecting money from ordinary people. 
However, this does not mean that person is earning more. 
Non-indexation of the child tax benefit means an additional shortfall of $602. 
A fine priority when we consider all the problems in society.  
The minister is far from fair.  
This year's budget is an insult to the people of Quebec. 
How can these federal ministers from Quebec claim to represent their constituents? 
I wonder, because what they have allowed to happen is unacceptable. 
What will Quebec get? 
A paltry $150 million. 
Once again, the Minister of Finance does not seem very fair.  
What a fine waste of time, money and energy.  
This budget contains in particular $328 million for health information systems. 
But what exactly does this have to do with the federal government, I wonder?  
Quebeckers are no fools. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Nevertheless it did put some back in. 
I think the reason it refused to sign the social union was a good one. 
If a province did not accept the money it would simply go to another province. 
Health is a provincial area of jurisdiction. 
It is one Quebec is capable of managing properly. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Since 1987 we have done okay. 
Canadians understand the challenge. 
The broad economic conditions of the country are coming together. 
Last year this government recorded the first budgetary surplus in 28 years. 
Fewer than 1% of Canadian firms perform any R&D. 
Moreover, not enough Canadian ideas are commercialized in Canada.  
Seventh, our exports are concentrated in too few firms.  
And that ranking is dependent on too few firms.  
This budget will increase that investment by an additional $200 million.  
We are accelerating our efforts to disseminate knowledge. 
With this budget, we continue our progress on the road of success.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
However, I would like to tell him about other figures.  
In 1992, there were 1,218,000 Canadian children living in poverty. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt, but the hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We do have a problem with being productive and keeping up with the Americans.  
Number one, of course I spoke about taxes. 
Goodness, that is hard to understand.  
I understand why they need to start a new party. 
The arithmetic in their old party just does not add up.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
We cannot solve one without dealing with the other.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
That is funny arithmetic.  
That is not small change in my books.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I raise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Oxford County is like many other rural regions of the country. 
At times our task seems impossible. 
We conquered the deficit. 
Why would they not espouse this basic tenet of Conservative philosophy? 
It is something that defines us as a nation.  
Members may ask what the federal government has done to protect medicare in the budget. 
The budget is about more than health care. 
It is moderate and it is sustainable.  
Let me quickly summarize the tax cuts in the budget. 
What does this mean to average Canadian taxpayers? 
That is an increase of 200,000 over last year.  
-let us do those ends 
That here were well begone and well begot: 
And after, every of this happy number 
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us 
Shall share the good of our returned fortune 
In 10 months we will enter a new millennium. 
Canada is ready to- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I will have to interrupt the member.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
He does not tell us that. 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure how the GST got in here. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the member's comments. 
We are well known for our high quality products.  
Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague makes an excellent point. 
I talked to some of the apple growers. 
I know that prices were a concern and I know that weather was a concern.  
This is a disaster relief program that we are talking about. 
As I understand it, any agriculturalist can apply for the relief. 
The hard copy should be ready in a couple of weeks. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
The money spent on the project would remain here in Canada.  
The editorial concluded by stating: ``And now what? 
The answer was to the United States. 
We had a serious military establishment, one that we as Canadians were very proud of.  
Our armed forces totalled 120,000 personnel. 
By the late 1970s our soldiers were the best paid in the world. 
To make matters worse, training was hampered due to a lack of ammunition.  
Under today's current Liberal regime things are much worse. 
The result of this Liberal government's cuts to defence spending has been dramatic. 
We have seen our troops drop to 60,000 from 73,000 in 1993. 
Hardest hit is our army, our land forces. 
Even then they will be poorly armed.  
This cannot be taken lightly. 
Here as in other areas the Liberals have failed.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
This is an increase of $650 for every Canadian. 
This is the sad truth that the Liberal government refuses to tell. 
They hide behind their spin doctors and their rhetoric machines. 
I think I have made myself perfectly clear. 
Canadians are paying more than they ever have before and they are getting less. 
What are they receiving for these astronomical increases in taxes? 
What do they have?  
They have a two tier health system. 
The health care system that Canadians have come to rely on is under siege. 
Almost 200,000 people in Canada are waiting for health care services. 
The Liberal government has taken $5 and it will give $1 back.  
That is the legacy of this government. 
Our soldiers have suffered. 
They deserve more, not less.  
Nothing seems sacred to the government. 
Look at Sydney, Nova Scotia, the tar ponds. 
Nothing has been done. 
Lots of talk but no action. 
We are paying lots and getting nothing.  
I think the point has been made. 
Canadians do not deserve this. 
Reform would deliver immediately $2 billion to boost federal transfer payments. 
Our soldiers earned our respect. 
Reform would introduce a credible plan for reducing the size of our national debt. 
Under this government Canadians will continue to pay more and get less.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for that question. 
I have come across a document. 
I would like to let members know how Canadians feel about this. 
These are the headings from e-mails received at the paper:
Tired of no value for my taxes. 
Lament decay of incentives. 
How dry I am. 
The bludgeoning of taxpayers. 
Milked and fed up. 
Hate this country and government. 
I have the bludget blues. 
That is coming from Canadians across the country. 
That is how Canadians feel.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Those guys are into the borrowed money scheme. 
We are not into borrowed money. 
We are going to pay as we go.  
We have to have the money. 
That is what we have been doing. 
Listen to the information.  
This government has refused to cap its expenses. 
The Liberals do not want a surplus Canadians can look at.  
Let us not talk about what we think. 
There is no plan. 
The debt will continue.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
When taxes are lowered there is a longer wait for services. 
When taxes are lowered laws cannot be properly enforced. 
We have to achieve that plateau of pointing in the same way. 
``This is our commitment to Canadians'', the document concludes.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question. 
The government has given priority in the budget to health issues. 
Evidently health is intimately connected to environmental issues. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
How would he address that? 
Would he mind clearing that up for me? 
Would lower taxes in his opinion be bad for Canadians?  
I will put it this way. 
Therefore the debt is no longer an economic preoccupation.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is very simple.  
Mr. Speaker, I fully agree with the hon. member.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
On this health care issue we have given back over $11.5 billion. 
We had to eradicate that deficit.  
How did we do that? 
We were honest with them, we were truthful with them. 
We have given that $11.5 billion back. 
That government should never have done that until it balanced the books.  
We have now balanced the books in two consecutive years. 
That has not been done since 1952. 
This Liberal government has done that. 
We have done it in a fair and equitable manner. 
Now we have decided to give back.  
Reformers just talked about this. 
We on this side of the House did it in 1998. 
There is an old axiom in life that talk is cheap. 
I think they are just blowing smoke. 
We have balanced the books for two consecutive years. 
It has not been done since 1952. 
We have given money back to the military. 
I have a great military establishment in my riding, CFB Petawawa. 
We have lowered taxes. 
Six hundred thousand Canadians are no longer on the tax roll. 
He should look after the poor people. 
It made a dramatic mess of the economy. 
I quoted Sir Wilfrid Laurier. 
He was one of our great prime ministers. 
I want the members opposite to pay strict attention to this. 
It is the desire of happiness with which we are all born into the world. 
We constantly gravitate toward an ideal which we never attain. 
And thus it will be as long as people are what they are. 
They are our future. 
They will be looking after us in our old age.  
However, these changes cannot be achieved by the federal government alone. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On questions and comments there is a lot of interest. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Do hon. members believe in miracles? 
I do because I have seen one. 
He was an independent then and gosh he liked the things I was saying. 
He used to shake my hand and say way to go, young fellow. 
The $2.5 billion I understand- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Sorry, that is the member's 35 seconds.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
And yet, they still cut health care.  
What sort of government are they, these Liberals?  
Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleague to calm down. 
It is our party, the Liberal Party.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to put a question to my colleague.  
I understand his enthusiasm. 
However, I would like to know if he is aware of the Constitution of Canada. 
Does the hon. member really know his Constitution?  
We must be careful and tell people the truth. 
Is he afraid to do so? 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I stand unequivocally by my statements.  
There is more than one big moose out west. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This brings an end to the debate. 
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The member was present but was missed by way of oversight or otherwise.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
What is referred to here is the number of people qualifying for employment insurance. 
I continue with the response: 
The correct number is 78%.  
The correct number is not 78%. 
In order to receive maternity benefits, a woman has to have accumulated 700 hours. 
Does she think we are crazy or what? 
These are not the people we are talking about. 
We are talking about those who have worked.  
I know because I went there.  
That is the problem.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
I was outraged by the kill and DFO bureaucrats were alarmed.  
I could not agree more.  
On June 19 the coast was divided into red and yellow zones. 
In red zones there was to be zero mortality of coho. 
Problems became apparent immediately.  
Concern for Dundas Island red zone sport fishery growing. 
Encounter rates of coho climbing.  
Area one coho encounters were then estimated at 80,000. 
The minister had promised that the fishery would be closed if there were coho mortality. 
A minimum of 30,000 coho were killed in this no-kill zone.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
This fishery was designated an experimental pilot sport fishery for chinook salmon. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We have several concerns, which are as follows.  
There was no independent testing done. 
Mitretek simply used the results of the tests by the company in question.  
We have several recommendations. 
One, that the government investigate the administration of the anthrax vaccine. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
These additional tests confirmed that the vaccine was both safe and effective.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.12 p.m.)
