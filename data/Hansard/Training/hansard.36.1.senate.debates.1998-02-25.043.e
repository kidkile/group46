Wednesday, February 25, 1998 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The budget's success is built on those policies.  
They were, however, the right decisions for our country's future.  
Where national unity is concerned, we see the same quality of leadership. 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
The base of the tree is made of 250-year-old red oak. 
This however will not be the end for the tree. 
He is a proud Islander and a proud Canadian.  
Increasing Incidence of Osteoporosis in the Population 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
As the population ages, this number is sure to climb. 
Basic research in Canada is underfunded. 
They want results and they expect a final report. 
The Canadian public deserves better management of their tax dollars.  
Visible Minorities in Canada 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
This was significantly important to make page 1 of The Globe and Mail .  
Today, the figure should read 11.2 per cent.  
That is a significant difference. 
Perhaps a report could be made on what steps have been taken to date.  
We will not wait another 30 years.  
Wednesday, February 25, 1998 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Twelfth Report of Committee Presented 
Wednesday, February 25, 1998 
Professional and Special Services $ 5,500 
All Other Expenditures 1,000 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday next, February 26, 1998, I will move: 
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
What is the government planning to do to change or curb that problem? 
This is an exodus.  
I am chairman of the Danny Gallivan Memorial Scholarship Fund. 
The honorary chair of the scholarship fund is Senator Hartland Molson. 
Yes, and we are moving towards that goal, Senator Nolin. 
Possible Reduction in Payroll Taxes-Government Position 
When can Canadians expect meaningful payroll tax relief?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That is exactly what Senator Lynch-Staunton has suggested. 
The actuaries suggest that there must be a certain amount of money in the fund. 
He reads well, doesn't he?  
Honourable senators, I also have a question regarding the EI fund. 
While you are up, tell us about the GST.  
Senator Berntson will have his turn, I am sure. 
It is important for us to understand that a reserve is needed because - 
That is not the question.  
I am saying that we are moving in the right direction. 
There is no cash in the fund. 
We all know that. 
I am trying to get at the contradiction. 
Would the leader explain how he can keep to the present position? 
Efficacy of Proposed Tax Reduction-Government Position 
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
As a result, take-home pay will continue to shrink.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
They need a job to be able to contribute to it. 
Where are the jobs?  
Honourable senators, there are no illusions in this budget. 
To reduce the deficit.  
The deficit went up and the surtax remained.  
Then take it off if you do not need it anymore. 
You want another reserve. 
Bring in the reserves.  
I will err on the side of those who put together the budget.  
The honourable senator talks about the surtax reducing the deficit. 
However, if you go back and check the records, they added to that. 
To reduce the deficit.  
That is because you continued the Conservative policy.  
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate:
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We are very proud of this budget. 
I take the matter of stay-at-home mothers very seriously. 
Ninety per cent of all taxpayers in the country will benefit.  
He did not answer mine, either.  
I will treat the question as one requiring an answer.  
Percentage of Visible Minorities In Public Service-Request for Answer 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Perhaps the honourable leader could give us a response to that question now. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Oliver has raised again another very important concern. 
I have discussed that subject with the Chairman of Internal Economy. 
Science, Research and Development 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am in touch with the doctors there. 
I would be very happy to do so. 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
However, there is a truly serious problem here, and it is one of national priority. 
There is a significant problem arising in the G-7 countries. 
I understand the concerns expressed by the Honourable Senator Keon. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Education traditionally has been a provincial field. 
I think it was underlined in the report. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The government calls this transparency; others call it creative accounting. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is a very good question. 
It is a difference in accounting principles. 
I guess one can regard it as a fair difference of opinion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Canadian Wheat Board Act 
Originally, the proposal was that we would travel to Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Regina, and Edmonton. 
I will not debate the details of Bill C-4. 
That has been done very well by other speakers before me. 
Right now, we simply have an audited statement. 
That does not necessarily mean that the board is being appropriately managed.  
That is their concern. 
I think it is a real concern, and it is one that must be addressed.  
Free trade is very successful in Manitoba, and very successful in the west. 
We want our products to move freely.  
Above all, Mr. Harvard reiterated: 
So why are we complaining? 
That is the true message behind all this. 
It is very important that we do that.  
The big thing in this push, as Mr. Hawkins states, is: 
Growth is occurring in Latin America, where the Brazilian milling industry is now privatized. 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
I wonder if Senator Stratton would accept a question.  
I am a little hesitant. 
Is that your understanding, Senator Stratton?  
I would not disagree with that at all. 
That is not what I am talking about here. 
Farmers want the ability to sell a cash crop. 
That is completely understandable. 
That is what it is about.  
The concern then is how is the vote set up and taken. 
How is the question worded? 
That is a concern that I think is real and honest on their part. 
My comment would be that perhaps those types of specific concerns could be overcome.  
We must receive his assurance that these issues will be addressed. 
People deserve concrete answers.  
Then we will not have this problem or concern.  
On motion of Senator Berntson, debate adjourned.  
Consideration of Final Report of Special Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Forest for yielding to me.  
Therefore, I will address my comments to these two areas.  
It is important to first identify the two different groups of students. 
Their parents may lend them money which they are expected to repay. 
Honourable senators, we thought this was a very important point. 
Many feel their debts have gone beyond their capacity to cope. 
The grant would go directly to the financial institution holding the loan.  
Obviously, there is no one solution that will cover every student. 
There needs to be a mixture of all three alternatives.  
This is simply no longer the case.  
People learn at work. 
They learn at home, and they learn in the classroom. 
I am sure honourable senators would like to know how PLAR works. 
I can use myself as an example. 
Early in my career, I was an assistant to my husband, a dentist. 
What had looked like an endless process now appeared attainable.  
I would now like to say a few words about jurisdictional considerations. 
They must work in tandem with each other. 
It was a tremendous learning experience.  
On motion of Senator Forest, debate adjourned.  
International Assembly of French-Speaking Parliamentarians 
Leave Having Been Given to Revert to Tabling of Reports by Inter-Parliamentary Delegations.  
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Senator Andrew Thompson-Consideration of Second Report of Committee-Order Stands 
That the Law Clerk report his opinion to the Senate by tomorrow.-( 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, there are two amendments moved by absent members. 
I think we would need their approval before dispensing.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I asked the table for their advice. 
Obviously, if there are objections, then we will not proceed. 
It can only be done by leave.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will await the return of the senators involved.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
I will leave it until we return after the break.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
