Wednesday, November 5, 1997 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Honourable Walter P. Twinn 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
In time, they, too, came to recognize the wisdom of his objectives.  
This would be accomplished without the agonizingly slow process of constitutional amendment. 
Walter was an affectionate husband, a loving father, a devoted chief and a conscientious senator. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
He was born into poverty on a Cree reserve 62 years ago. 
He attended residential school. 
He hunted, trapped, fished and logged. 
He was poor, and he did not like it. 
He picked the round, and he delivered hardship and adversity a knock-out blow.  
Senator Twinn was a creative and innovative spirit. 
He was a giant among his people and a leader for his generation.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Senator Twinn was called prematurely to his next life. 
He was a man to be admired.  
Walter Twinn transcended all racial, business and political barriers without hesitation. 
That best epitomizes the world in which Chief Walter Twinn lived. 
That indicates what Walter really thought of his people. 
It is the elders who play a dominant role in aboriginal life. 
Elder Mary Kappo said: 
I have left the eagle to soar in freedom. 
Have I done all to keep the air fresh? 
Have I cared enough about the water? 
Have I left the eagle to soar in freedom? 
Have I done everything I could to earn my grandchild's fondness?  
Senator Twinn was a very interesting man. 
I had not known him before he was appointed to the Senate. 
Senator Twinn became ill approximately two or three years ago. 
He had a chest X-ray and underwent an operation. 
The doctor told him that he could not do any more for him. 
It was interesting to see all those who attended the funeral yesterday. 
I was rather surprised to see him there. 
He said, "I know you, Senator Watt." 
When I arrived, I realized why he was concerned about it. 
Senator Twinn was concerned about all of the bands with which he worked.  
The community itself is quite large, large enough to have an airstrip. 
However, in landing, you must approach the lake. 
If the captain misses the runway, you land in the water. 
We fell back in our seats when he let the brakes go. 
As Senator Graham said, he has done a great deal of work for the community. 
I did not know him well. 
However, I got to know him as a colleague here in the house. 
I was quite shocked when I first heard of his death. 
He is too young to go to the Happy Hunting Ground. 
However, we have no control over these kinds of things.  
In all of our cultures, certainly among the Okanagans, we have a Creator. 
In our culture, we talk about the Creator. 
We all hope that one day we will go to some Happy Hunting Ground. 
To Catherine and the family, I extend my sympathies and prayers. 
I wish them well in the future.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
We also have Eric Stephenson from Guelph, Ontario. 
On behalf of all honourable senators, welcome to the Senate.  
Canadian Parliamentary Association for Development and Population 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
We can then assess how best Canada can make a contribution.  
Population, sustained economic growth and sustainable development are all interrelated. 
Decline of Social Health 
I see it happening here in Canada as well, to my despair. 
I believe that its continuation into the future depends on a strong middle class. 
Look around the world. 
Let me give you a taste of the facts reported in this article. 
Most distressing are the specific references to children. 
Moreover, children have been found to be particularly vulnerable to downturns in the economy. 
This report should be a clarion call to us all and to the government.  
Frankly, as an Albertan, I was embarrassed yesterday. 
Public harassment and verbal abuse of homosexual individuals is not uncommon.  
That is commonly found in Alberta.  
This issue is about equality, compassion and fairness. 
Too often, silence has resulted in horrible consequences.  
It was a black day, a day I would just as soon forget.  
Hon. Jean B. Forest :
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
This year's theme is "Career Designs are Life Designs." 
The world of work is changing constantly. 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
First Report of Standing Joint Committee Presented 
Hon. Philippe Dean Gigantes :
Wednesday, November 5, 1997 
The Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament has the honour to present its 
PHILIPPE DEANE GIGANTES Co-Chair 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Persons Case National Historic Park Act 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
International Conference on Governance for Sustainable Growth and Equity 
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
Special Committee Authorized to Engage Services 
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
International Conference on Governance for Sustainable Growth and Equity 
Meeting Held at New York-Notice of Inquiry 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of all honourable senators, I wish you welcome to the Senate.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
That is from Article 3 of the settlement agreement.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
- had suffered through no fault of his own. 
Simple justice and fair dealing required no less.  
That is on page 4 of Mr. Justice Gold's decision. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I assure the honourable senator of my concern. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have just one general comment. 
The economy itself is clearly on a path of higher growth and stronger job creation. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I appreciate the honourable senator's answer. 
However, I have a further question.  
This is Canada, not the Politboro.  
They will blame some clerk in the civil service.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
At the Prime Minister's press office, they said, "Call these two numbers." 
It is important that we alleviate any potential problems.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
He undertook at that time to have a look at the situation.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, with respect to wages, I am still pursuing that answer.  
Can the minister be any more affirmative than that?  
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
He sounds a little tired today. 
I can understand why he might sound a little quiet today. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I do not know the specific answer to that question. 
The government wants the Investment Board to be totally independent of the government. 
We hope to have it before us very soon. 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
It seems that our government is standing by doing nothing. 
I have here a newspaper article entitled "Clinton offers up Canada." 
What is the government doing about this situation? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this is a serious question. 
I saw the article to which Senator Gustafson is referring. 
The cattlemen and grain producers in particular are very concerned 
We take his representations seriously, and I will do just as he has suggested.  
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Parliament of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
That is the current composition of the board.  
This formula worked well until the 1997 election. 
The current board has nine members. 
Therefore, clause 2 of the bill makes provision for an acting Chair.  
The board would then designate one of the members present to act as Chair.  
Hon. C. William Doody :
Honourable senators, would the sponsor of the bill permit a question?  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Honourable senators, I also have a question for the Deputy Leader of the Government. 
I make no apologies for that.  
It is not something that has been sprung upon them.  
The Senate is not scheduled to sit next week. 
Honourable senators, I wish to ask a question of Senator Cogger. 
Is that what the honourable senator would like?  
It was more fun!  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I have a question for my colleague Senator Cogger. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
That the Committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
That the Committee have the power to hear witnesses via video conferencing; 
That the Committee present its final report no later than December 5, 1997; 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that the understanding on both sides?  
Honourable senators, I am pleased to speak to this motion. 
The economic difficulties in my province are well known. 
We have a small population, roughly half a million people spread over a large area. 
There have been other issues as well. 
Unfortunately, these attempts were unsuccessful.  
That amendment itself represented a compromise. 
It would not have eliminated the so-called unidenominational schools in the province. 
All schools will remain denominational schools. 
Accordingly, he granted the injunction.  
Some schools had to be reopened. 
Some teachers who had been laid off had to be rehired. 
I was struck by a number of passages in the court decision. 
Nevertheless, he observed several times that: 
That is, the revised Term 17 - 
After referring to some of the inefficiencies of the former denominational system he continued: 
Instead, it decided to hold a second referendum. 
This issue was very simple and straightforward. 
The question put to the citizens of my province of Newfoundland was: 
This question - and I believe everyone agrees on this point - was clear and straightforward.  
The results, honourable senators, were equally clear and straightforward. 
Seventy-three per cent of voters supported the proposed reform. 
This time, it is clear that those fears were without foundation. 
The proposal was carried by 47 out of Newfoundland's 48 electoral districts.  
Honourable senators, these are compelling figures.  
Hon. C. William Doody :
At that time they had no committee. 
Comprehensive hearings were held in Ottawa and in St. John's.  
It was not accepted by the majority of the people on the committee. 
The courts in Newfoundland eventually struck it down. 
That is the story of what happened. 
We are back again. 
Did they support the last one?  
I suppose that is inevitable. 
If you have 23 members on a committee, you must set a time limit. 
This motion suggests that teleconferencing is the order of the day. 
I do not think that is right. 
We will not have to worry about them. 
However, perhaps, I misunderstand and travel will be allowed. 
Indeed, it should be encouraged.  
Minority rights are really the crux of this matter.  
It reads as follows: 
If this is so, whose rights may be the next to go?  
I respectfully ask you to vote no to the proposed amendment to Term 17.  
It is the vote of a majority taking away a minority right.  
Let me quote from the proceedings in the Senate on that day. 
Again I quote Senator Lewis: 
Senator Lewis went on say: 
The resolution was similarly agreed to in the House of Commons on June 23. 
Now, honourable senators, here we are in 1997, 15 years later. 
What have they done? 
That is what they have done.  
This change, clearly, is being brought in without the consent of the Pentecostal people. 
Other denominations in Newfoundland have done so. 
There is no quarrel with that. 
That is their right. 
They have every right to do that. 
Some 24,000 Roman Catholic children are registered for the Roman Catholic system. 
They were given that choice by the provincial government and they took advantage of it. 
Therefore, I have to give them credence.  
Part of that process is the joint committee which has been suggested.  
That is the very least that the minorities in Newfoundland deserve.  
On the referendum itself, there are some serious questions that must be answered as well. 
I hope that the committees will explore this area as well. 
He said that the question is very clear. 
They will all be given opportunity for religious instruction. 
That is what one can easily infer from that question.  
The Ayatollahs will decide what that means.  
That is quite specific. 
It absolutely outlaws denominational religious instruction. 
This is unheard of. 
This is a big leap backwards! 
This is something that Chairman Mao would embrace! 
This is what is going on in Afghanistan now. 
The state is deciding what the religion will be - the state! 
I am the state.  
There is no quarrel with that. 
That is their right. 
They can go to any school that they want to attend - at least they could. 
There was much outcry about that. 
The result was a significant number of closures of schools. 
Approximately 30 separate Roman Catholic and 13 separate Pentecostal schools were closed. 
The process is working its way through the system. 
The system was compressing; money was being saved. 
In conclusion, I wish to address the referendum itself. 
Thus, the majority of the people were voting for the status quo. 
It is far more complex than the numbers would suggest. 
When you get a few nice days in August, you take advantage of them.  
As I said, funds were requested from the government by representatives of the no side. 
One had to be a quick study to keep up with that process. 
It was not a very good way to run things.  
When was the question known?  
The question had been published 32 days prior to polling day. 
Then there was the matter of scrutineers. 
I do not know if that has ever happened before in Canada. 
This is passing strange. 
Honourable senators, I merely raise these problems. 
I will reserve judgment until later.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
It is so critical and articulates so well the right of freedom of religion. 
Article 18 reads as follows: 
Subsection (4) is very important, and it reads: 
4. The States Parties to the present Covenant - 
It is the legislature which "must" - the word is "shall" - teach courses in religion. 
I read to you from the international covenant: 
Quite frankly, I believe that the intent of the drafters was something else. 
This particular proposition must be changed. 
It is very dangerous.  
Upon considering this distinction, an important point becomes apparent. 
In the proposal before us, section 17(3) speaks to religious observances. 
This one is interesting, because here a right is given to the parents: 
However, even that is not without some serious difficulties. 
This case is known as the Zylberberg case. 
This is what is known as indirect or unintentional burden. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue?  
If I could table my notes, honourable senators, I would. 
However, I know that it is not the practice in this place. 
Obviously, it was examined in 1949. 
It was examined again when the Pentecostal amendment was put forward. 
Only a year or so ago it was examined here. 
This time, however, that is exactly what we are being asked to do.  
I have not arrived yet at my own conclusion on the minority rights issue. 
I will want to learn from the experience that we gain in the committees.  
I wish to concentrate more on the text of what is being proposed. 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Honourable senators, would the honourable senator entertain a question or two?  
I would be happy to answer any questions the senator may have.  
I think I understand them.  
The child is affected by a particular religious structure by a simple accident of birth. 
In trying to understand that, I put forward the following example.  
Let us say that a young Roman Catholic couple are married and conceive a child. 
Who gets to claim this child? 
Perhaps his colleague Sister Peggy might be able to help him.  
If the issue were to be decided, which court would decide it? 
Is it the Roman Catholic court which does that? 
I can share this with honourable senators. 
All the other rights in our Charter are predicative of everyone. 
In many other countries, constitutional charter rights are limited to citizens. 
Rather, they avoided the question.  
Everyone has the right to freedom of religion. 
What is written in this Term 17(2) is exactly that. 
To read again what is being proposed: 
More than that, it may not be specific to a particular confession.  
That is where they should have put it.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Honourable senators, I would like to ask a question of Senator Kinsella.  
Yet we deny them these rights. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Third Report of Committee Adopted 
From a budget point of view, it is difficult to commit funds to expenses. 
That makes forecasting inaccurate. 
Honourable senators, I recommend that we adopt this report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Adoption of Second Report of Committee 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of this report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
I am pleased to point out that this honour falls to our colleague, Senator Gauthier. 
Second, we must pay the additional cost of the activities of parliamentary associations this year.  
Additional money is also needed to complete parliamentary committee rooms. 
Last year, two committee rooms were completed, and another two will be operational this year. 
Honourable senators, I ask the Senate to adopt this report. 
However, if you have questions, I am prepared to answer them.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Hon. Lowell Murray , pursuant to notice of October 30, 1997, moved: 
Honourable senators may recall that this was quite a controversial piece of government legislation. 
They are mandatory for the calculation of support.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Committee Authorized to Study Health Care Services Available to Veterans 
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell , pursuant to notice of October 30, 1997, moved: 
That the Committee submit its report no later than June 30, 1998. 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Honourable senators, I am happy to support the motion. 
We wish to take advantage of his expertise.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
