The House met at 11 a.m. 
SALARIES FOR STAY AT HOME MOTHERS AND FATHERS 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.) moved: 
I turn the floor over to my colleagues. 
Canadian parents want to hear whether or not you will be supporting my motion today.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
It is interesting that this is what they have done.  
I truly hope it is a real start. 
Let us seriously consider the motion. 
It calls for the government to pay parents. 
Is it really simple?  
I have had parents ask me these questions. 
How would this work? 
Do these parents qualify? 
They both work but they both stay at home with the kids.  
Does this not add more stress to the family? 
Maybe there is a better way. 
There is and I am going to get to that in a moment.  
I think they are. 
Why then would they want to pay the high taxes that they pay? 
This is expensive bureaucratic manoeuvring. 
Where is the value added by flowing the money through Revenue Canada? 
Put a dollar in and get 75 cents back out. 
The bureaucracy burns up the rest.  
Why not just leave the dollar with the taxpaying family in the first place? 
Save us all the money. 
As well, there is no added bureaucratic cost flowing through Revenue Canada.  
Finally, let us examine the concept of paying someone to be a parent. 
In effect, parents would be hired using their own money. 
Down the road would conditions be applied to the salary? 
Is that far-fetched? 
No. Parents have children to build a family and express their love.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
Everyone in Canada knows that family policy is a provincial responsibility. 
In short, they said: 
We are still looking for them. 
The project was cancelled. 
It was swept under the carpet. 
People in Quebec gave some thought to finding the appropriate solution. 
It was put into effect and is working.  
There may well be a certain amount of visibility involved. 
Let me give you an example.  
They have three children. 
They have to do with the indexing of tax tables. 
Here is another contradiction. 
This is another contradiction that dampens the member's good will. 
There is the whole issue of pay equity. 
This is yet another example of bad faith.  
We in the Bloc Quebecois are proposing constructive solutions, which I will outline again. 
First, to use the surpluses to restore social transfers to the provinces. 
We must seek the opinion of women's groups on this. 
We must consider solutions people put forward.  
There is a problem that needs to be resolved. 
The gap between rich and poor is widening. 
They have developed another, and are capable of continuing to develop it.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
It is a very important issue that I think must be debated in the House.  
They are nurturing those who will shape the future of our society.  
Instead of opening doors for women it could limit the options.  
This is where the danger lies in the motion. 
That struggle has gone on for more than 14 years. 
There is no question that families in Canada are under incredible pressure. 
Unfortunately this motion does not address that.  
Therefore there is no incentive for provinces to provide more child care spaces. 
This hurts poor women and children the hardest.  
Canadians do care about child care. 
That is a very important matter in terms of accessibility. 
Despite promises to the contrary, this government has done nothing.  
That is the kind of value the Liberal government has placed on caregivers. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
I congratulate him on that.  
The motion is a good idea, but it should be looked at more seriously. 
The member must realize that his own government will never agree to his motion. 
But it is nice to dream.  
If the member were serious, he would perhaps be looking at more realistic solutions. 
More flexible work schedules could be established. 
I do not think the government is prepared to spend that kind of money. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
No, but it is a start and we are working in the right direction.  
This is not a debate about child poverty. 
That is a very important point. 
Poor people can raise very healthy, well adjusted children. 
Rich people can have very poorly developed children. 
Poverty is an exacerbating factor, not a causal factor.  
The study is long but the conclusion is not. 
The conclusion is very important. 
That first year is very important.  
The study does elaborate a bit. 
One really important issue is breast feeding. 
There is a lot of research regarding the importance of breast feeding. 
That is not an insignificant amount. 
That is an outstanding statistic that members should keep in mind.  
Many initiatives have been brought forward in this place. 
It passed in this House in the last parliament. 
It passed 129 to 63 in this House. 
It has to do with farm mothers. 
It also does not address lone parent families. 
Again I want to congratulate the member for Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I commend him for his initiative.  
I would like to talk a little about the national children's agenda. 
I will begin by briefly outlining the positive history of the development of this agenda.  
It involves participation at many levels of authority.  
Some people may ask why a national children's agenda is necessary. 
That quite frankly is why we need a national children's agenda. 
That is very important for all of us as Canadians.  
This also is important to note. 
This represents an overview of the national children's agenda. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I want to immediately let everybody know where I am coming from. 
I think we all agree on this. 
I have studied this for quite some time. 
The second point I would like to make is incentive. 
Finally, the devil is in the details. 
What regulations would accompany this? 
Unless that is happening, we are going to have problems. 
Does the House understand the request made by the member?  
Does the hon. member have permission to put the motion?  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
It is important that we find solutions. 
It is also important that the government listen to families.  
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
This is a reflection of the skyrocketing growth of the Internet. 
To safeguard privacy, however, there is a significant challenge to be met. 
All of these uses can unavoidably reveal traces of personal information.  
Bill C-54 will provide this protection. 
It is a set of ten fair information principles. 
The privacy commissioner's role will include receiving and investigating complaints and mediating disputes. 
The result is that protection is incomplete and, quite possibly, inconsistent. 
This situation is no longer acceptable.  
The legislation before us strikes that balance. 
Information privacy is crucial for a number of reasons. 
The legislation before us will help to provide that protection. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Some very good points have been made in the bill. 
It is not as if electronic commerce developed yesterday. 
It has been with us for quite some time. 
What is this electronic commerce anyway? 
What are we really talking about?  
We are talking about the business of making transactions via telecommunications systems using computer technologies. 
It is almost as if computer technologies and telecommunications are separate. 
I do not think one could exist without the other. 
The two are very much involved.  
How big is electronic commerce? 
It looks like there will be not only a tenfold increase, but a manifold increase. 
Nobody knows exactly how fast this electronic commerce area is going to grow.  
Why is this an issue today?  
First of all, we have many laws in Canada covering paper transactions and paper commerce. 
However, traditional boundaries do not exist on the Internet. 
Which law or tax then applies? 
The global positioning system, for example, is strictly an electronic mechanism. 
Satellites such as RADARSAT make a very significant contribution to electronic commerce. 
It provides information, for example, about what is happening to the ice caps. 
What are some of the issues involved? 
Is my account being credited or debited as it ought to be? 
Verifying signatures is a very significant issue as well.  
The public information cryptography issue is involved. 
There was a lot of resistance to this particular issue. 
A policy statement was finally drafted. 
I believe there are some good aspects to this particular policy. 
However, the issue is that it is not protected in this particular legislation. 
I would like to deal with encryption a bit further. 
It is actually a code. 
Someone who does not know the code cannot uncover the message. 
We know that the Internet is accessible by many. 
There are many people who are pretty sharp at discovering encryption systems.  
When we enter the field of laser technology we are dealing with a complicated issue. 
I refer to the beginning of the bill. 
``Should'' is a guidance and not an obligation. 
Let us go to schedule 1 and have a look at what is there. 
In section 4.2.3 it states: 
The purpose should be stated. 
An application form, for example, may give notice of the purposes.  
This is a possibility. 
It should be there, but it is not a requirement that it be there. 
Is that not an interesting contradiction or at least an implication of confusion? 
We need to look as well at the conflict of interest issue. 
We know that banks today own trust companies and insurance companies. 
Some of them are health insurance companies and life insurance companies. 
The potential for a conflict of interest is very real.  
There are some very interesting issues. 
Electronic commerce cannot exist without a traditional infrastructure for moving things and people. 
A contract must ultimately be signed and become operational. 
Funds must actually be moved from one state to the other.  
It is not just the ability of being able to do electronic commerce. 
There is an interdependence between electronic commerce and regular or traditional kinds of commerce. 
There is no relationship. 
We need to recognize that there needs to be a back-up for intercommunication. 
It involves all kinds of aspects. 
It involves many people and things. 
We need to know where are the airplanes, the satellites and the rockets on land. 
The situation on the sea is similar.  
Then they must expect to be able to apply it. 
There also must be integration. 
The minister has often talked about the issue. 
According to him it is the way the system operates. 
The Canadian economy is functioning very well. 
We need to do better. 
We need to learn about a couple of issues. 
That means the responsibility of doing it right is greater than it has ever been. 
Above all we need to recognize the need for integrity and leadership in the country. 
We need to know more. 
The bill is not sufficient. 
We need to understand the significance of what we are doing. 
We need to be confident. 
We need to tell the truth. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Privacy is a fundamental right. 
This situation is no longer acceptable.  
That legislation has proven itself. 
I will give clear and documented examples. 
27(1) The Governor in Council may make regulations- 
A meeting to this end is being held here right now. 
And Canadians do not have enough protection, not in the least.  
The problem is that all this is extremely confusing. 
The commissioner may attempt to resolve the complaint through mediation. 
If a solution can be found, great. 
But what happens if no solution is found? 
This is what people want to know.  
Do members have any idea what this means?  
This bill will disappoint a great many people. 
It is not the role of Canada to undermine the protection they are currently afforded. 
There is a real problem.  
This bill is extremely disappointing. 
Telemarketing was debated in this House. 
This provision remains completely vague in the bill. 
I will not read the full title again. 
This is sad and woefully inadequate. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
I will refer to what could be exploding as a new way of doing business. 
Within another three years from now that could accelerate to nearly $400 billion. 
At this point it would appear that Canada is playing a leadership role.  
These types of jobs would become automatically redundant.  
When one starts to think about the online world a certain minister comes to mind. 
Bill C-54 goes further than this. 
They would benefit business as well as the piece of mind of the consuming public.  
In itself it is a good thing. 
It will do little to make Canadians feel more secure.  
It is true that the Internet presents a very difficult medium to regulate. 
In many cases this is because they simply cannot afford to. 
Many Canadians in rural areas have begun to voice concerns. 
We have all been hearing from rural Canadians. 
That is now coming under some question.  
It seems that the government has put the cart before the horse on this issue. 
The costs are keeping electronic commerce in the big leagues. 
The present program is good but certainly is not good enough at its present stage.  
There is another important issue surrounding electronic commerce. 
There is a danger that electronic commerce will eliminate whole types of workers. 
I see my time is quickly wrapping up. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have a short question to ask the hon. member from the NDP.  
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to hear that my colleague was paying attention.  
That is exactly the point I was making. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my hon. friend has asked for a short answer. 
My friend makes an important point. 
This is something we cannot rush and that is what we are saying. 
It is a relatively small and a relatively wealthy country.  
All Canadians should have the opportunity to participate. 
In other words there should be equal opportunity to participate in e-commerce.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Trust is at the very centre of this entire exercise. 
However, this issue goes well beyond the boundaries of the industry department. 
Possibly this is legitimate advice but there are other ramifications to this.  
There are industries that are immune to Internet competition. 
Incentives are a very intricate balance in the marketplace. 
Some are intrinsic such as the desire to be self-employed. 
The important issue to note is that there are artificial incentives created by legislation. 
Instead we should be looking for ways to cut taxes. 
It is not an insurmountable problem. 
At issue is the interim situation. 
I suggest that this situation be addressed sooner rather than later. 
There should not exist a timetable for when tax regulations will be fair. 
Fairness must remain an inherent fundamental.  
There was fundamental agreement in five areas. 
However this is not the world we live in today.  
How do we respond to this?  
The House is charged with the duty of protecting and fostering Canadian interests. 
However we must be realistic about the competition that exists out there.  
The cold reality is that Internet commerce cannot help but be brutally efficient. 
Price as a determinate will become the overriding decision maker on the Internet. 
Government's role will be greatly curtailed in the exercise.  
The challenge before us is no less than monumental. 
The days of paying lip service to providing incentives must come to an end. 
There is no way to legislate others to invest in Canada. 
Whether this suggestion has merit or not is a point for debate. 
Computer costs have come down dramatically in recent years. 
However personal computers are still out of the reach of many households. 
Knowing this we cannot accept that some might be disenfranchised.  
This is not a subject which should fill us with fear. 
There is no basis for such fears. 
These same positions are ones which traditionally have not leant themselves to trade union affiliation. 
The proposed amendments would create an admissible provision which defines electronic signatures. 
The Internet is a primary tool used for software theft. 
I have spoken to some very large picture issues regarding e-commerce. 
It being 2 p.m. we will proceed to Statements by Members.  
STUDENT WEEK OF ACTION 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
The result of this has been a dramatic increase in student costs.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The Prime Minister forecasted his own actions 18 years ago. 
The hon. member for Ahuntsic.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
He also served his country heroically in World War II. 
This is a sad loss for all Canadians.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
GOVERNOR GENERAL'S AWARD 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
He strong armed the provincial Liberals into not running candidates. 
He has called Alberta's Senate election a joke. 
WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
This gave them the opportunity to be appointed to the Senate.  
It is for this reason that we celebrate women's history month every year. 
The hon. member for Lanark-Carleton.  
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Dickson was known as a strong supporter of minority rights. 
He continued to contribute to public life in Canada right up until his death.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The hon. member for Pierrefonds-Dollard.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
She has every reason to be proud of this honour bestowed upon her.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
With a coastline as long as Canada's, this is scandalous. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois wishes to extend its most sincere congratulations to Andre O. Dumas.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
How many more cheques have been sent out? 
What assurance is there that this type of wasteful management will not happen again? 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Details can be obtained through Family Service Canada.  
1998 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
This Nobel Prize is none too soon in coming, and is richly deserved.  
They have restored freedom to Northern Ireland.  
PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF NEW BRUNSWICK 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Those candidates are Everett Sanipass, Brad Green and our leader Bernard Lord.  
It will be the first day of a long electoral career.  
Congratulations on Bernard Lord's victory today.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
According to the solicitor general this is fair.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It has been done many times.  
But there is no complaint against the students. 
If they have problems as witnesses, the lawyer in charge- 
The Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are not accusing the students of anything. 
It is the students who are complaining about the work of the police. 
That is what is happening. 
We are not, as the Leader of the Opposition is, comparing the students with criminals. 
They are not criminals. 
They are making complaints against the police. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is wandering around in circles. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They are not accused of anything. 
The students have made their complaints.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They are the ones complaining against the police. 
No one is accusing the students of anything.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just explained the process. 
That is why we established that commission. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Unfortunately, that still does not prevent him from making bad decisions.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, absolutely not. 
That is exactly what it is doing in this case.  
A request was made. 
I considered it and decided against providing funding.  
There are many tribunals of this kind which operate throughout government. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
No one is accusing the students of anything. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am quoting Patrick Watson. 
We did not call the president of the CBC. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is how things are done.  
I know the Bloc seldom has reason to complain about the CBC.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Prime Minister. 
How does the Prime Minister answer that mother's question? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I do not know whether or not there are consequences. 
All sorts of techniques were used in the past. 
Apparently, this was a new one I did not even know about. 
The member suggests that an individual may have been hurt. 
If she is still in pain, I apologize.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
I will repeat the question to the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I have no problem with that.  
If the Prime Minister wants to continue his answer, he has time.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
What more does he want? 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Pepper sprayed students have been denied this request. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They do that for any Canadian who has a complaint against the RCMP.  
That is the way the commission was established.  
But in no such complaint in the past- 
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Why is this same government refusing legal funding for the students? 
Where is the basic impartiality, equity and fairness in this process?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no accusation against any students.  
Just throw them in jail.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
The RCMP is being attacked. 
It is the commission that will tell us. 
Let it do its work.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
They are accustomed to it and they deserve a fair hearing free from political interference. 
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Show trials may work in Indonesia but what is- 
The hon. solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is well regarded internationally. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
My question is for the real deliverer of that message, the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is like during the last referendum. 
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has again slapped Albertans in the face.  
Ninety-one percent of Albertans want an elected Senate. 
Both Premiers Klein and Bouchard want to change this country. 
Premier Klein wants to hold a good faith vote on an elected Senate. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I dealt with it. 
The Leader of the Opposition does not seem to understand what I was talking about. 
Is that not shameful?  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
However, a significant part of the surplus comes from the employment insurance fund.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
He refused to allow Liberals to run a candidate. 
Why the double standard? 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
ACTION PLAN FOR FOOD SECURITY 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last Friday we commemorated World Food Day. 
Some time next year there will be six billion people on this earth. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
It calls for activities and initiatives both in Canada and abroad.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Thus the Nisga'a treaty becomes part of the Constitution.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the opposition would do well to read the Constitution of Canada.  
We believe firmly in section 35 of the Constitution and will protect it.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
There are two things the Prime Minister does not seem to get. 
Second, the commission itself requested funding. 
Presumably the commission has some notion of its own mandate.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is part of debate.  
I am not an expert. 
This is why we have a commission to look into that. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON TRADE 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We think that is appropriate. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
How can it have faith in him? 
The solicitor general has compromised this process without regret or responsibility. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Consequently there were broad consultations before I made my decision.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I guess that is yes.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the question is a very timely one. 
In 1995 the government began the aboriginal head start program. 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The RCMP has been told to stop using its boats and planes. 
The results have been disastrous.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Like all government agencies, the RCMP is going through a period of restraint. 
How it exercises restraint is an operational issue. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I am happy to have the Bloc Quebecois support the government's position.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, payroll taxes are a barrier to jobs. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Then every year after we took office we brought those premiums down.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade. 
Would the minister please advise the House of the status of those negotiations?  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
It is something we look forward to and that we embrace with full enthusiasm.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
These cuts are much more than fiscal restraint as the solicitor general indicated.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We are talking about a period of restraint as many departments are going through. 
Colleagues, I have received notice of a question of privilege.  
CANADIAN MILLENNIUM SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The place for that debate is in this House and nowhere else.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
In business that principle is called encumbrance of funds. 
Obviously, the disbursements pursuant to that fund have not been made yet. 
It is a prudent way to manage. 
We have a history of prudent management in this government. 
We are prudent managers.  
Of course, we are planning and putting moneys aside. 
First, let me set the stage. 
A specific date was mentioned.  
I took the two points as being part of one. 
I have had advice from at least one member. 
I would be willing to entertain them for a little while. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
I thank you for your advice. 
As I put it in place in the first section, that was a moot point. 
I am going to take this under advisement. 
REFORM PARTY'S ANTI-PROFITEERING ACT 
Our nation may be facing a year 2000 computer breakdown crisis. 
We have seen tremendous floods in Manitoba. 
On behalf of my constituents I present this bill.  
CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 
(Motion agreed to and bill read the first time) 
I table that motion and seek unanimous consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Could he read the motion again, Mr. Speaker? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I made a big mistake. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
With respect, the motion was not accepted. 
It would have had to have been accepted unanimously.  
INDONESIA'S CHINESE COMMUNITY 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today. 
The first petition has to do with the family.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is on the subject matter of alcohol.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
There are hundreds of petitioners calling for this.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The petition is with regard to abortion.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 118 will be answered today. 
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Now I turn my attention to the specific provisions of Bill C-54.  
In many ways this bill is a starting point. 
As such we have only chance to get it right the first time. 
That is a good thing. 
It is not my desire to hide any portion of the legislative process. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Some people have said it should do more as far as making rules and restrictions. 
This is a global and we have to proceed with caution.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
This is an area that is changing rapidly because of advancements in technology. 
Technology almost on a monthly basis is becoming more powerful. 
It is also becoming a lot more functional in capabilities. 
At the same time there is a tremendous reduction in costs.  
What the industry wants to see is business taxes as usual.  
If we as a country think we are an island we are wrong. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
I was also the president of the Association de securite informatique du Quebec. 
That bill has now been enacted. 
This is not the only type of information transmitted by computer. 
I await his answer.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the Bloc for his question.  
That is what will make the Internet and e-commerce grow.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Unfortunately, there is no such guarantee in the bill.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member of the Bloc Party for his question.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
This also applies to individuals. 
We are also the ones who fostered and promoted the invention of the telephone. 
We are ranked number one in knowledge workers by World Economic Forum . 
No longer is geographic size a liability. 
Indeed from B.C. to Newfoundland we are but microseconds away.  
What is the advantage of e-commerce? 
Here are some very interesting statistics.  
It might also tell us something about its profitability over the last few years.  
This rapid change is not without its liabilities. 
This will have a tremendous impact on book retailers. 
Canada has currently a 5% share of transactions over the Internet. 
Canadians have been quick to embrace the Internet. 
As many members have also mentioned, we are not just talking about Internet. 
However I am talking almost exclusively of the evolution on the Internet.  
There is a liability to using the Internet. 
Less than 16% of these people will actually use the Internet to conduct commerce. 
There is a general fear concerning privacy issues.  
There is a problem. 
Who is taking it? 
Who is using it? 
What other uses can they make of it?  
We can all think of abuses. 
Many people have stated that governments should keep their hands off the Internet. 
We opened up the west before we actually brought in law and order. 
Of course it was a rough and tumble place. 
I believe that is exactly where the Internet is today. 
It is a rough and tumble place without enforceable laws. 
There is one issue which goes outside the e-commerce point for a minute. 
The whole issue requires a significant amount of leadership. 
This is the very fundamental way they can do it. 
We mentioned very quickly the encryption technology. 
That is why we have an inside track at the starting gate. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
I think there are places for that.  
Therefore, I do not really understand why there is such a big concern. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The title, which is very long, reads in part:
It is very important. 
Canada is becoming a smaller and smaller country. 
All the people of Canada will be able to compete successfully in that marketplace.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I do so on behalf of the residents of Waterloo-Wellington.  
Clearly this is the way of the world.  
Canada's future prosperity will reflect our success in this economy. 
Electronic commerce is at the heart of the new information economy. 
But this will change and soon. 
We have to assure privacy, and that is absolutely important. 
His colleagues in the provinces agree. 
They have been calling for privacy safeguards that would protect consumers from coast to coast.  
Protection in the private sector is sporadic and uneven. 
It makes the legislative adjustments that are necessary if electronic commerce is to flourish.  
Bill C-54 provides all of these things. 
This legislation will provide other benefits as well. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the comments made by the member across the way. 
I must say his concerns are well-founded. 
He considered the protection of personal information to be important. 
Quebec is at the forefront. 
It is working well and could no doubt be improved. 
This would have been an excellent opportunity to improve on it. 
I have a question for the member opposite. 
Clause 27 provides that: 
(1) The Governor in Council may make regulations- 
As for me, it does not make any sense.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
I point out for all Canadians that he is in error in his premise.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to repeat the title of the bill under consideration: 
What is electronic commerce? 
Most of us are familiar with ATMs, and use them on a regular basis. 
But there are also transactions between businesses.  
This is the challenge facing the government.  
That was in 1982.  
The problem is that between the opinion of the Minister of Justice- 
The pendulum has swung the other way.  
It is clear that there must be a major growth in that sector. 
It is obvious that we must adopt legislation concerning electronic commerce.  
I will give the House an example. 
The bill does not spell this out clearly. 
We have a pretty good history in this matter. 
We took the lead in the protection of personal information.  
One can condemn duplication. 
On can say that things should have been done differently. 
Some finishing work has not been done. 
The governor in council is the cabinet. 
On this point, there is work to be done. 
The difference in ideology is obvious.  
At the federal level, electronic commerce is the main object of the bill. 
Personal information also means businesses' trade information. 
This bill has many other flaws. 
The framework of the bill is its schedule. 
This is rather odd. 
We will include it in the legislation as is''. 
But is it enough?  
They are very clear on that issue. 
As I said, the bill is rather unclear. 
The bill is open to various interpretations.  
What is meant by ``a reasonable effort''? 
I want to get back to one important element. 
The status of this type of exchange is not clear.  
There is nothing in the bill with regard to this type of exchange.  
There is a double standard. 
The consequences of these various aspects makes members of the Bloc Quebecois wonder. 
We have just gone through this with employment insurance. 
In short, the issues are fairly clear. 
We think this will become very important. 
It is therefore very important that the federal government go back to the drawing board.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
You go into a department store. 
This is how it is that members of the public receive junk mail. 
So, we go to a store, buy something and get a receipt. 
We think ``fine'', but the act has just been circumvented.  
The federal government has taken the opposite approach and given priority to business. 
I can understand that things take time. 
We are in a new area of law. 
Let us level the playing field. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I prefer the Louis XIV clause. 
That came from private interests. 
I think the Chair should pull him to order. 
We are not dealing with that point.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That was not a point of order either.  
This could have a significant economic impact.  
The less this happens the better. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
The purpose of this legislation is to support and promote electronic commerce. 
How will this bill support and promote electronic commerce? 
When we talk about electronic commerce, what exactly are we talking about? 
These types of transactions have been in existence for quite some time. 
Electronic data interchange is not longer restricted to large corporations and government. 
So far so good. 
It would be terrible.  
But we have the tools to make it very difficult for them.  
One should not generalize and panic. 
Our credit card number is handled by strangers.  
It is a bit the same on-line. 
In the vast majority of cases, there is no risk.  
This is when the notion of facilitating electronic commerce comes into play.  
I would not do it.  
What are the two problems that can arise in terms of protection of personal information? 
That is the first problem.  
Then, there is also the misuse or illegal use of the information. 
It is here to stay. 
I know, I was there. 
I was one of the players, as a computer specialist by profession.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
Sounds like the hon. member opposite would like to speak, Mr. Speaker. 
They bow down in front of the computer god. 
Are there other things that need protection?''  
Commercial data are only the tip of the iceberg. 
That is where the problem lies. 
The federal government is kow-towing in front of electronic commerce. 
It says ``Commerce is important. 
That is what it says. 
Legislation such as this does not deserve to be passed. 
It should be as good as the one that Quebec has had for four years. 
It should build on it. 
It should also build on improvements that could be made to it. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member has four minutes left.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
Will there be other people speaking after me? 
I feel like continuing. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are four other members who would like to take part in this debate.  
However there are four minutes left in this session. 
Is the hon. member for Portneuf requesting an extension of time in debate?  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the request of the member for Portneuf. 
Is there unanimous consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is no unanimous consent. 
The hon. member for Portneuf has four minutes remaining.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
They deserve something at least as good as what Quebeckers have. 
Canadians are not well served by this legislation.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
I see that the Liberal member knows exactly what I mean.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a few comments to make. 
I support Bill C-54 in principle. 
All kinds of stakeholders contributed to it. 
The government was very proactive in seeking this input. 
Unfortunately when legislation is created by consensus there sometimes are difficulties. 
The standard in schedule I waffles on the issue elaborately. 
These could be lists of charities or donations. 
They could be any kind of list like that. 
My friends on the opposite side should be enjoying this.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
I knew you would.  
Then the code sets out to try to explore what sensitive means.  
That makes us wonder.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
We are putting the cart before the horse. 
But consumers should not be compared to chickens. 
That word is all over the place in schedule 1.  
Would my colleague care to comment?  
I have a suspicion that it will not.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
First, I agree with his comments. 
The losers will be the consumers. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Sometimes these lists are held within Canada and sometimes they are held outside Canada. 
In my mind there is a bit of a hole there. 
That creates an enormous problem. 
I happen to have something for the House to contemplate. 
Talk about religion being sensitive. 
It is the total list of all Canadian Jewish donors. 
It is even worse than that. 
Those are 502,000 names that anyone can access. 
I would submit that is very dangerous.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Madam Speaker, the member for Wentworth-Burlington is not making this up. 
Quebeckers are well protected in this regard.  
The legislation is four years old. 
Quebeckers are well protected. 
But it can happen in Canada. 
Quebec's legislation goes much further. 
Is that not extraordinary? 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
I cannot really tell. 
It does not matter anyway. 
In Quebec, we have the Consumer Protection Act. 
From there it goes to Ankara, and Ankara sends it on to Moscow. 
The bill is extremely narrow, in fact. 
What are the thoughts of my colleague from Wentworth-Burlington on this?  
It is not just a domestic problem. 
It is a worldwide problem.  
But also we have to be cognizant that we can only do so much. 
That is the information that I think can be used very dangerously.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The titles reads as follows: 
It is a rather complex bill. 
I am sure you remember this.  
The member for Drummond said the same thing a little while ago. 
They even broke into the offices of the Parti Quebecois, a democratic political party. 
There were leaks inside the RCMP. 
There was the Keable Commission. 
RCMP officers were prosecuted. 
The same government did not fire the RCMP officers. 
Instead, they were promoted with a pay increase.  
Members can see how important this Henry VIII clause is. 
Nowadays, everybody is sorry about it, of course.  
They lost their head. 
There were a dozen of FLQ members and they threw 500 people in jail. 
The War Measures Act abolished freedom in Quebec. 
That is how dangerous the Henry VIII clause is.  
That was not done by the Parti Quebecois. 
Consequently it is always subjective. 
This bill is full of holes. 
It undermines Quebec's legislation. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
This cannot happen in Quebec. 
``I got it in such or such a place'', he will answer.  
This is obviously not the purpose of Bill C-54.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
We fully realize that this could hit us in the face. 
The government is stretching the elastic. 
With the technical means that we have today, this may be very useful. 
I think they are useful against terrorist acts. 
Our Prime Minister must be protected. 
Imagine how these laws are misused. 
Who does he think he is? 
This reminds us of the way things worked under Hitler. 
There was no respect for the individual.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I am sure it can be purchased now anyway. 
It is available somewhere for a certain price.  
I hope the member is right on that.  
I appreciated the remarks. 
This is a problem that extends across borders. 
Does the member have a comment with respect to that?  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I will discuss the phenomenon of electronic commerce in the information age. 
Other types of transfers are those conducted through open networks such as the Internet. 
Canadians have demonstrated a lack of faith in the minister. 
It is our job to address these concerns.  
It is obvious that pornography on the Internet is a serious problem.  
Canadians do not want cyberspace to be lawless.  
Bill C-54 goes farther than this. 
They would benefit business as well as give peace of mind to consumers.  
Cryptography technology allows users to encode information and then pass it along the Internet. 
In itself this is very good thing.  
I fear that the government has forfeited any means whatsoever of policing the Internet. 
It will do little to make Canadians feel secure.  
Premier Frank McKenna had decided he was going to close schools. 
He ended up with broken bones. 
The gentleman went for another pail of clams. 
This time he had his shoulder and his arm broken. 
It is outrageous to think that they are capable of breaking limbs. 
He stayed in the park. 
Had it not been for him, we would have ended up with nothing. 
Mr. Vautour was smart. 
He said ``I am not leaving. 
This is what happened to Mr. Vautour. 
This is what they did, and Jackie had a large family. 
He stayed anyway and he kept fighting.  
We were not pagans in Kouchibouguac park. 
We were not trash. 
We were not bad people.  
In those days, the current Prime Minister was the minister responsible for expropriation. 
It is incredible how forgiving we Acadians can be. 
I was 11 when we moved away. 
In our region, people did not have much formal education. 
But my father had work year round. 
We were good folks and still are. 
The story does not end here. 
Mr. Vautour was 65 and his wife, 64.  
Is there any justice, any democracy in this country? 
It is the same all over the country.  
It is ironic for me to have become a member of Parliament. 
The government does not want to look into what went wrong.  
We will carry on and we will not let them down. 
Coming back to Bill C-54.  
In principle this is a good proposition. 
I think it is important to mention that we have a lot of schools. 
But how many jobs will be lost? 
Is anybody trying to maintain some kind of balance in all that? 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
We can get their names, as well as the International Planned Parenthood Federation. 
I submit that is a very dangerous thing.  
It is very hard to get this information.  
Immediately underneath it is the National Anti-Poverty Organization. 
Under that we have the National Gay and Lesbian Rights Supporters. 
These are all actually in alphabetical order.  
Is this something that is acceptable to the hon. member? 
It is supposed to be friendly to everybody. 
I have my limits on friendliness. 
It goes on and on. 
There is a need to get control of what is happening on the Internet.  
That is not what I am talking about. 
Most of us in this country have common sense. 
Sometimes it is unfortunate that common sense does not always win. 
There are so many other factors that common sense is put off. 
I have to agree with my colleague. 
There is a need to strengthen it.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I have listened to what all my colleagues have said. 
It is true that I am a defender of the right to privacy. 
It is not an easy job. 
It is a bit like having someone break into your home. 
For me, the right to privacy is absolutely essential.  
I have also looked at the difference between the provincial and the federal legislation. 
What does the provincial legislation say? 
The emphasis of the federal bill can be seen. 
The bill has some serious weaknesses, in my opinion. 
The schedule contains most of the substance. 
This is typical of this government. 
I would also like to mention the famous Henry VIII clause. 
It was as simple as that. 
Otherwise, there might be 45 victims on this side of the House. 
But who can amend regulations? 
In dealing with this bill, we have to consider the big lobbying firms. 
They have a lot of money.  
Will it be the opinion of consumers? 
Which is the biggest backer of political parties? 
We have no problems with this. 
Our funding comes from the grass roots. 
But who funds the Liberal government? 
Those are the ones with the big money. 
They are the ones backing the Liberals.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Pierre Corbeil knows who it is.  
To whom do you think the governor in council will listen? 
Who do you think the cabinet will listen to? 
Not the defenders of the right to privacy. 
The Governor in Council will listen to those who are behind the funding. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
In the meantime, the minister just throws up his hands.  
This government does not even come close.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Some 300 delegates from 45 countries attended the event. 
We would have preferred to settle this dispute on a bilateral basis. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.34 p.m.)
