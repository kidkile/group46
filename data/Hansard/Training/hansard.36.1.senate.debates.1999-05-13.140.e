Thursday, May 13, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Research and learning is at your fingertips. 
This is also an important asset for instruction in the classroom.  
As he said recently: 
We knew at the outset this was a major innovation. 
The winner of this coveted award will be announced at the beginning the June.  
This centre will be unique in North America. 
We are living in a time of scarce resources. 
Quebec Major Junior Hockey League Championship 
Congratulations to Titans of Acadie-Bathurst 
Players on both teams turned in performances that were worthy of our national sport. 
International Day of Families 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
The family touches upon so many facets of life. 
Families are educators; they are providers; they nurture and they reinforce. 
Families need to be supportive and encouraged. 
They need the necessary resources to build a good life.  
However, there are many elderly people who lack the care that families can provide. 
People of all ages need family. 
I cannot image life without a family. 
Therefore, on this day, may we reflect upon the challenges facing families in our society. 
Most important, let us honour the resilience of the family.  
The Honourable Solange Chaput-Rolland 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Nurses are incredibly patient, dedicated and responsible. 
It comes with the profession. 
The profession is becoming increasingly cohesive and politicized. 
Politicians simply cannot afford to ignore them any longer.  
We owe them our support in recognition for the service they have rendered.  
Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck :
The battalion was under the leadership of Colonel Sutherland from Pictou, Nova Scotia. 
These men did not ask to serve in a segregated naval battalion. 
They were willing to serve in any capacity. 
They went overseas as a construction battalion attached to the forestry corps. 
They were commended by the government for their service to king and country.  
We are proud of that battalion. 
Some of them were our grandfathers and fathers. 
They did the work they were asked to do.  
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
When children's children shall talk of war 
as a madness that may not be; 
When we thank Our God for our grief today, 
and blazon from sea to sea 
In the name of the Dead the Banner of Peace - 
That will be Victory.  
Those are the words of Robert Service.  
It very well might happen.  
Senator Whelan is often quoted as saying, "Frank, you cannot prove a negative." 
Sound currency is a basic human need. 
His presence would be a challenge for us.  
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Thursday, May 13, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Fisheries has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Honourable senators, with leave, later this day.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, do you wish me to defer this motion?  
I have no objection, honourable senators. 
It will be deferred anyway, since the motion is for consideration later this day. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I would ask the Clerk to read the report in full.  
That is not necessary. 
I wish to have a copy distributed.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will provide a copy in the meantime. 
We can revert to it when we get the written text.  
Miscellaneous Statute Law Amendment Proposals 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
With leave of the Senate, later this day.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will have the report printed. 
Budget Report of Joint Committee Presented and Printed as Appendix 
Thursday, May 13, 1999 
The Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations has the honour to present its 
("A" presented only for the Senate) 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, it is the same with this report. 
May we have a printed copy in front of us? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
First Nations Land Management Bill 
The Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples has the honour to present its 
Clause 28, page 15: 
In the English version, replace line 25 with the following: 
"other first nation community purposes.".  
2. Replace lines 42 and 43 with the following: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, leave was requested to proceed with this matter now. 
In the meantime, the Table will see that the report is circulated.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this concludes Presentation of Reports from Standing or Special Committees. 
Honourable senators, is it agreed?  
Canadian District of Moravian Church of America-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Hon. R. James Balfour :
Solutions to Tobacco Problem 
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I wish to thank the Honourable Senator Oliver for his question. 
I was in Halifax last week at the time of the announcement. 
It was not just Halifax versus New York.  
I am hopeful for a successful outcome for the Halifax bid.  
Honourable senators, that was interesting. 
It confirms the government's support of the bid. 
However, Halifax was not successful; their bid was rejected.  
It will take them quite some time to do so. 
They will not do it in one or two years. 
Blasting and dredging will be involved and it could take several years. 
We have been assured of that by Maersk-Sea-Land.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the minister. 
My question for the minister is apropos my comments yesterday. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am doing my very best.  
I know you are but do not let them snow you.  
When I take part in the official opening in Cape Breton of one building - 
I am on your side.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Declining State of Industry-Response of Government-Request for Update 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
We farmers are proud people. 
If we have one major fault, it is that we are too productive. 
However, that has been a great strength for this country.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I spoke directly with the Prime Minister. 
I hope that he will continue to do so because this is a serious crisis. 
A serious crisis is developing. 
Many farmers do not have the funds to put in a crop. 
It is very difficult for them.  
The government must take the ad hoc steps necessary to alleviate the problem. 
We need both a short-term program and a long-term program. 
Again, I appreciate the leader carrying the matter to the government. 
I ask that he continue to do so because the situation is very serious. 
Let me respond to the valuable statement.  
I have one clipping from the Star Phoenix of Saskatoon, printed yesterday. 
Kevin Hursh is the author.  
I will read the first sentence and the last sentence. 
The headline is "Farmers shouldn't be cowed by AIDA." 
The first line reads: 
Just fill out the darn form and send it in. 
The final line reads: 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, that illustrates that the AIDA program is not working. 
It is based on 70 per cent of the average of the last three years. 
In addition, there has been great confusion about the program. 
The findings of the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture on this matter are very serious.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Declining State of Industry-Response of Government 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Farmers are very clever. 
Why would you fill out a form that you know will not change your position?  
That is the issue with which we must grapple. 
We are asking for something now. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I thank the Honourable Senator Andreychuk for bringing that aspect to our attention. 
They will not be there to benefit from next year's forecast. 
Something must be done immediately.  
We have experienced an ice storm and floods. 
I thank the honourable senator for her further comment. 
I treat this matter very seriously. 
I shall again talk to my colleague later today.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
My second question has to do with something I read in the National Post .  
Mr. Clark will never learn. 
The other day he said that he was still friends with Lucien Bouchard...  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I also recognize that Canada speaks for Canada in international negotiations.  
Comments by Minister Dion-Request for Clarification 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Could the minister explain in greater detail the tactless position taken by Minister Dion? 
This position is an insult to Quebecers, even those who are not separatists. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Mr. Dion is Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
I shall be pleased to bring the representations of Senator Nolin to his attention.  
Is there an agreement with the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
A new academic year will begin in September.  
I am not aware of any other signings.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Canada-United States Relations 
Officials will also be consulting closely with Canadian] industry.  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Reception for King of Jordan 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Regretfully, there simply will not be enough room. 
As well, this is a parliamentary matter.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I believe that the adoption of the others was moved and seconded.  
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Miscellaneous Statute Law Amendment Proposals 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I move the adoption of this report.  
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore (Acting Speaker) :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Budget Report of Joint Committee 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
First Nations Land Management Bill 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Income Tax Amendments Bill, 1998 
He referred to Minister Martin when he said: 
He is stealing our freedom, never mind about the productivity declines, and all those jobs.  
It could not have been said better.  
The good news about this bill is that it does have some tax reductions. 
They will not help as much as substantive and meaningful cuts.  
I will give you an example. 
It has been basically the same for the last five years. 
Saskatchewan gives you 35 per cent, and that was done by the NDP. 
It does not accomplish the goals of venture capital. 
He was promptly put in his place by the Prime Minister. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
T he Hon. the Acting Speaker:
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
First Nations Land Management Bill 
Report of Committee Adopted 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Might I read his remarks for him?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Most of these concerns centred on two issues. 
They also asked for greater clarity with respect to the rules applicable to compensation.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill, as amended, be read the third time?  
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
With leave, now, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The minister is also in agreement with these provisions. 
Decisions can be made at the local level.  
The minister has stated that we are entering into a new era. 
This is the road to self-reliance and the road to self-government.  
This bill is a win-win situation for all parties. 
The court will also be available for the same kind of challenge.  
This is a significant issue, one that we must address. 
Clearly, this is an issue that needs resolution. 
The rules and procedures cannot discriminate on the basis of gender.  
There is much work to be done. 
I thank you all for your support of Bill C-49.  
Honourable senators, Bill C-49 was an interesting process. 
Therefore, in the absence of Senator Ghitter, I should like to make a few comments.  
I cannot believe that I supported a Liberal amendment. 
Nevertheless, I supported Senator Austin. 
They knew that that was the way to get the process started.  
This is another order of government that we are setting up. 
We will see it later on, in the fall.  
It is then flung on Parliament, and citizens become angry. 
If we are not open, there will be racial tension. 
I do not blame the bureaucracy. 
There must be general direction from Parliament as well as from the government. 
We must develop the debate.  
That is a good forum in which to debate the issue. 
We should urge the minister to discuss it in the other place.  
The collection of union dues was also banned. 
The minister wrote a letter to Kamloops, stating, "You cannot do this." 
We are always told that the federal laws of application apply. 
However, there is no evidence of that. 
That is what happened in this bill. 
Many important and fundamental issues are outstanding. 
For example, how do Charter rights apply? 
We should not get into a discussion about self-government. 
We must talk about our country.  
Matrimonial rights and property rights are serious issues. 
The aboriginal people believe in collective rights. 
As a Conservative, I am a strong believer in community. 
However, I am not a collectivist. 
I have a significant problem with that. 
It will blow up in our face.  
We should have been talking about the bill, not about leases. 
However, that is exactly what we were doing.  
The Meech Lake Accord was only to discuss "distinct society."  
Bill C-49 is an enabling bill. 
That is a good thing. 
It is one bill. 
You can change one bill, you can deal with one bill. 
That will not be good for any of us.  
I support Bill C-49 in its present form. 
I am glad that we were able to make the amendments to clarify it. 
This process was a great learning experience for all of us, honourable senators. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, I will be very brief. 
Yet when we come to do something, everyone is apprehensive about taking that first step.  
This is one of the important steps. 
The question of the expropriation was logically the most contentious aspect. 
I understand that there are people who are still apprehensive. 
That apprehension I can understand. 
There is no reward without risk. 
I hope this is a reward for our aboriginal peoples.  
I wish to issue a word of caution, however. 
The most cowardly dollars in the world are investment dollars. 
I will finish on this thought:
It was Chief Justice Lamer of the Supreme Court of Canada who said: 
Let's face it, we are all here to stay.  
Let us remember that statement. 
Honourable senators, I will not keep you long. 
We have major issues in shaping Canada.  
A great many British Columbians are "worst case" worriers. 
That is our role. 
I thank honourable senators on both sides. 
Truly, in the Aboriginal Peoples Committee, we show how effective the Senate can be.  
Hon. Shirley Maheu (Acting Speaker) :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
COASTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Miscellaneous Statute Law Amendment Proposals 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I move the adoption of the report.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Since there is no urgency to it, I should like to adjourn the debate.  
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Mary Alice Butts :
Now the Senate needs to provide for the report's recommendations.  
Second, laws forbidding euthanasia maintain the moral integrity of the medical profession. 
They maintain the distinction between healer and killer. 
Thus, the modern call for euthanasia is unnecessary.  
In her words, "Never have I seen conventional treatments so ineffective."  
Honourable senators, Dr. Morrison need not have faced that dilemma. 
We, as legislators, can ensure that they have it. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Order Stands 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise seeking information. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The order stands in the name of Senator Poulin. 
International Search or Seizure Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
All senators are interested in the right to privacy. 
Bill S-24 would further delay investigations. 
It would add a protection beyond the case law and the Charter. 
International assistance is an essential means to combat this problem. 
For all of the above, I cannot agree to support Bill S-24.  
Consistency remains, as always, the ogre of smaller minds.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I should like to pose a question to Senator Grafstein. 
Bill S-24 deals with a Charter right. 
What is the opinion of Senator Grafstein on the extent of Charter rights? 
Honourable senators, the way the question is worded raises a difficulty. 
I would rather respond with regard to the limitations of this bill. 
This is my reading of the bill. 
If the objective of the bill is different than that, I remain open-minded. 
I cannot believe the Senate would agree to that.  
However, suppose the request for a search and seizure were made in this country? 
I see the drafting as being much larger than that. 
You do not have to be a Canadian citizen. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I think Senator Grafstein is misreading the bill. 
It is not a question of protecting criminal elements. 
A Canadian may have assets abroad. 
The Government of Canada may want to search the account for a number of reasons. 
Honourable senators, this bill was inspired by the Airbus affair. 
The Government of Canada wrote the Swiss nearly four years ago. 
Shall we go over that letter again? 
No, we had better not. 
The Government of Canada besmirched reputations. 
I would urge Senator Grafstein to read the minority judgments of the Supreme Court. 
I believe there were two dissenting opinions in the Schreiber case.  
With respect to the ambit of the bill, I say: 
I think I understand the purpose of the bill. 
That is obviously for the Senate to decide.  
That is not what this bill does.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.  
They are not exactly partisan bills. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned, on division.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Order Stands 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Once again, honourable senators, this bill is straightforward. 
Why is it necessary to keep standing this order? 
Why the delay by the government?  
It is not saying anything partisan. 
To my mind, it improves an existing act.  
Why is the government delaying and adjourning the debate on this matter? 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That is the only explanation I can give to Senator Lynch-Staunton at this time.  
I accept that and thank the deputy leader.  
State of Financial System 
Consideration of Report of Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee on Study-Debate Concluded 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
That report is entitled "A Blueprint for Change." 
There it stood until Thursday, April 29.  
Those banks now aspire to be world-class players. 
Surely there is an advantage in long-term commitment. 
Take the car business as an example.  
Unlike the banks, these dealers are specialists. 
They are in a single line of business. 
It is a complex business, but it is still a single business. 
I hold no brief for either the banks or the automobile companies. 
They need a network of sound dealerships. 
They are in the banking business, not the automobile business.  
I come now to my second argument. 
It relates to tied selling. 
Are you planning to lease a car soon?"  
Wisely, the Banking Committee is opposed to tied selling. 
To achieve that new, higher level of competition, the committee makes several recommendations. 
They can be found at paragraphs 147 through 163. 
Michigan was the test case in the manufacturers' study. 
However, I must say that I am open to persuasion. 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
Honourable senators, would my honourable friend allow me to ask him a question?  
Does the honourable senator not find this quite odd?  
Honourable senators, I think I have anticipated various parts of the question in my speech.  
That is one point.  
Another point is the one I mentioned concerning specialization. 
General Motors, for example, is in the car business. 
It must maintain its dealerships or it is in real trouble. 
That is not true in the case of the banks. 
The committee report says that tied selling is very bad; that it disrupts the market. 
Surely, we are presenting the banks with a wonderful temptation. 
Surely, Senator De Bane is interested in protecting the integrity of the market.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I also have a question to ask of Senator Stewart. 
He mentioned the difference in charges for renting cars. 
No, Senator Taylor, not to my knowledge. 
They are adducing this evidence to rebut information already on our record. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I agree generally with the report. 
There are only some points that I should like to make. 
This stands in sharp contrast with the way national financial systems are designed. 
...the sink for weapons, both old and new, recycled and cutting edge.  
We should not underestimate the tensions in this region.  
I note that China has the largest army in the world. 
Wealth is being siphoned off for weapons. 
All these issues were dismissed. 
Nor was the economic miracle questioned. 
Rather, many foretold of its expansion. 
I shall say more about this later.  
For example, the need to assist small and medium businesses was paramount. 
The need for continuity of knowledge in our embassies was another issue.  
Team Canada to open the door and APEC to lower barriers.  
What was the result? 
The question marks that hang over the Asia miracle have little to do with business. 
Mr. Chris Patten in his book East and West at page 110 states: 
References were not to be tolerated. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue?  
Professor Acharya responded as follows: 
European countries have existed for centuries. 
They have had their own fights and wars. 
My answer to that is that the world has changed. 
One should try to adapt to it much faster.  
Until recently, people used to say look at Southeast Asia. 
Singapore has done very well. 
It is economically prosperous partly because of a kind of soft totalitarianism. 
The leaders of Singapore used to say look at India; look at the Philippines. 
That, of course, has changed.  
Yet, per capita income has grown in Singapore.  
Again, Professor Acharya responded by saying: 
The issue becomes very complicated.  
We just have to make sure that political authorities do not abuse it.  
Many others echoed his position. 
That was left to individual Canadians and organizations. 
In this process, our values and good practices were left at the door at home. 
"Economy first" became our slogan.  
What happened to cause this? 
However, many questioned: "When were we shrill?" 
The trouble with this constantly moving approach was two-fold. 
However, many outside of the government disagreed. 
In our view, this is short-sighted...  
It was created and propelled by the government. 
I personally would have gone further. 
It mattered greatly in 1997 and it matters just as greatly now. 
Time and time again, we have had that debate. 
It said, "We do not have the structures. 
It is our security that is being threatened. 
We must go to these measures." 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition):
Both involve the academic community, a community in which I myself participate.  
I recognize that the Official Languages Act does not apply directly to the universities. 
I found that somewhat curious. 
Does that not speak to something? 
It does not happen. 
They all communicate in the official languages of their country.  
These government changes have had a major impact on people's daily lives. 
In the face of this, the commissioner severely criticized the federal government. 
They will soon stop fighting for their rights. 
This means that the corporate culture of these companies must reflect that reality. 
They also underpin our country's constitutional, political and cultural foundations. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Gauthier, debate adjourned.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until Monday, May 31, 1999 at 8 p.m.
