The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
MR. WAYNE GRETZKY, O.C. 
Tributes on Retirement from National Hockey League 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
He called hockey "the great Canadian metaphor."  
Gretzky was, quite simply, uncannily good. 
Small and slender, he was an artist in a fast and sometimes violent sport. 
He was always the most brilliant playmaker of all time.  
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
However, there were many parallels - and horizontals - in our careers. 
In the lobby of the hotel, I ran into Wayne's father, Walter. 
The advice that Wayne's grandmother gave young Wayne was to watch Frank Mahovlich play.  
Wayne said, "No, I think I will watch Gordie Howe." 
I ended up with a pin in my knee. 
To this day, that pin reminds me of my hockey career.  
A fellow by the name of Rick Barry played basketball for the San Francisco Warriors. 
That team won the NBA championship a few times. 
Mr. Barry is in the basketball Hall of Fame. 
I thought, what a compliment to both human beings.  
They complement each other.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
In addition, the federal government has disbanded the port police. 
The police are literally trying to fight crime with both hands tied behind their backs.  
We need to look at funding. 
Finally, I turn again to the issue of the port police. 
Surely it is the government's responsibility to protect our borders from criminal elements. 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Minorities are said to be excluded both overtly and subtly.  
We have to defend this cause daily. 
Again this morning, the Federation des etudiants universitaires raised this issue. 
This seems to be the essence of the current dispute.  
The National Assembly's resolution proposes a way of resolving this dispute. 
Unfortunately, the attitude of the federal minister strikes me as completely ridiculous. 
Certified General Accountants' Association of Canada- Report of Committee 
Tuesday, April 20, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has the honour to present its 
Pages 2 to 3, clause 4: 
(a) on page 2, replace lines 15 and 16 with the following: 
(b) on page 3, 
(i) replace lines 10 to 12 with the following: 
"( g ) to encourage and assist certified general accountants to", 
(ii) replace lines 21 to 24 with the following: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Young People and Tobacco Use 
National Council of Welfare 
Report on Preschool Children-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Release of Census Information- Presentation of Petition 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Senator Comeau raises an important point. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
However, no formal agreement was announced. 
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Honourable senators, I am not aware of just how formal were the discussions. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Discussions are ongoing, of course. 
There will be a further meeting in China this coming fall. 
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
The letter was signed by Geoffrey Pearson, its national vice-president.  
What is the response of the Canadian government to this important statement?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I will examine it as soon as the Senate adjourns today. 
I believe Senator Roche is a former president of that particular organization.  
We would hope that, in such an eventuality, Russia will be very much involved.  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Forthcoming Summit-Statements of Government on Nuclear Policy-Request for Tabling 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, if that information is available, I shall certainly make it available here. 
There is no prospect of either doing so at this time.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, a review of the record will show that they did make such statements. 
The leader should check his literature a little more closely.  
Were these expenditures approved by cabinet? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The costs of our military contribution will accumulate over time. 
The figures I have mentioned do not include the cost of expended munitions. 
What additional expenditures does the government intend to make?  
Honourable senators, I will repeat the numbers for Senator Roberge. 
Prior to that, we had committed $22 million. 
Honourable senators, that will happen over time. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
How does it work?  
Comments on Underground Economy in Report- Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We look forward to further work. 
Legislative Measures to Combat Underground Economy-Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Possible Tax Reductions to Combat Underground Economy-Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
At the same time, their personal budgets are stretched to the limit. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Third Reading-Motions in Amendment- Debate Continued

"( a ) allow the appeal, if it is of the opinion" 
"( b ) describe the offence in respect of which the surrender is requested;" and 
( f ) by renumbering all cross-references accordingly."  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
I strongly disagree with this proposition. 
This comment deals with the legal implications of such an action.  
Therefore, I will use the example of Charles Ng. 
We will never know what he wanted to do with these accessories. 
The United States might well refuse to give such an assurance.  
What would be our choices, then? 
In fact, he has been tried and convicted of these horrendous crimes.  
We live in a real and practical world. 
We must lobby and work through the United Nations. 
Our current extradition process is a cumbersome one. 
Two critical features of this bill will facilitate extradition to the tribunals. 
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Bryden.  
Therefore, there is an obvious discretion.  
The amendment proposed by Senators Grafstein and Joyal reads: 
Perhaps my colleague could elaborate.  
You are quite right; it is legal. 
By the way, we are criticized by some countries in Europe. 
They have their laws and we have our laws.  
The amendment states, in part: 
Is my honourable friend saying that the minister has no more discretion? 
Is that his reasoning?  
There are no smaller penalties. 
I do not see how it can be operative in that situation.  
We then turn back to the law as it is proposed. 
The minister may refuse to make a surrender order if the minister is satisfied. 
That is quite a discretion. 
The minister has that power. 
It is more than just a discretion. 
That is the way I read it. 
I do not know how the court will read it. 
He may just refuse because there is a death penalty. 
Your interpretation is correct. 
What would occur with the amendment is that the minister shall refuse, and must refuse. 
There is no discretion.  
Subclause ( b ) of the amendment reads: 
The word "may" means that it is not mandatory, but that it is permissible. 
If you read the clause in the bill, it states: 
Under this amendment, the minister shall refuse where: 
That is the way clause would read, and that would apply. 
If you have a death penalty, it is mandatory. 
My understanding, honourable senators, is that there are two situations:
Let us take the Ng case as an example. 
Honourable senators, my problem is that, in a sense, the onus has been reversed. 
That request could not be made under the other state's law. 
There is a death penalty, so we cannot entertain the application. 
"Welcome to Canada, Mr. Ng."  
On motion of Senator Beaudoin, debate adjourned.  
Statement of Minister of Finance- Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Honourable senators, I could not believe my eyes. 
As well, he could have mentioned deregulation of the transportation sector.  
Helicopters and Pearson airport come to mind. 
The GST has produced revenues which have greatly contributed to deficit reduction.  
Honourable senators, price stability was an achievement of the Mulroney government. 
Interest rates often go hand and hand with inflation rates.  
All they had to do on the other side was follow the plan.  
I suppose we should be thankful for that. 
These very policies are driving the economy today. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Stratton, debate adjourned.  
Privatization and Licensing of Quotas 
Consideration of Report of Fisheries Committee- Debate Continued 
Leave having been given to revert to Reports of Committees: 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Individual quotas represent a seismic break with the fishing traditions of the past. 
Many other Canadians were also congratulatory of the work of our committee. 
He went on to say: 
Much of the evidence we heard, however, suggests otherwise. 
According to the department, they have a limited time span. 
They are bought, sold and leased. 
The minister's response to the committee's recommendation is that: 
Their perception is that individual quotas are being imposed on them. 
I therefore urge all senators to support the committee's report.  
My question relates to the minister's appearance before the committee last week. 
That belongs, perhaps, to the Department of Human Resources Development." 
Can the honourable senator help me?  
Honourable senators, I am frantically flipping through the text of the minister's statement. 
I read it earlier and my recollection is in accordance with Honourable Senator Stewart's. 
I have another short supplementary question. 
I would agree with Senator Stewart. 
The responsibility lies with the government and the Parliament of Canada to initiate that process. 
On motion of Senator Fernand Robichaud, debate adjourned.  
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Motion for Production of Documents Relevant to Proposed Privatization-Debate Continued 
( d ) minutes of departmental, inter-departmental and other meetings; and 
Honourable Senator Graham, P.C. ) 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Whether it is sufficient for his purposes is another question. 
It is in this vein that I am proceeding.  
Furthermore, citation 447, which is on page 131, provides that: 
This is where we must, unfortunately, part company.  
In his speech, Senator Murray stated: 
It is for this reason that we cannot support this motion.  
In its report tabled last month, the committee urged: 
According to the Journals of the Senate , nothing was ever tabled by the government.  
Senator Murray said at that time: 
That is found on page 998 of the Debates of the Senate of the day.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Murray, debate adjourned.  
Alliance of Manufacturers & Exporters Canada- Second Reading 
Leave having been given to revert to Private Bills: 
Honourable senators, I thank you for your indulgence. 
I should like to advise the Senate of the contents of this bill. 
It is a very simple bill.  
That particular section of the act reads: 
6. The Association may - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. J. Trevor Eyton :
However, in the interests of brevity, I will mention only a few.  
The first is the need to provide financial security for people entering retirement. 
First, it will lower investment risk. 
Such a concentration of investment increases risk. 
By the end of 1997, they had skyrocketed to over $270 billion. 
This reduces their competitiveness which, in turn, costs jobs.  
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Recent Decision of Supreme Court of Canada- Inquiry-Debate Continued 
( f ) to the nation-wide, extensive commentary and public discussion on the matter; and 
Honourable senators, I would be quite happy to see the Supreme Court overrun by feminists. 
Sadly, this is not presently the case. 
I find it difficult to imagine the feminist movement intimidating the judiciary. 
I quote from Justice L'Heureux-Dube's observations in her decision: 
Could it be to express that the complainant is not a virgin? 
I do not understand, honourable senators, how one can possibly characterize these observations as insulting. 
To this question I have an answer. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Nolin, debate adjourned.  
Health Care in Canada 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon rose pursuant to notice of April 13, 1999: 
However, it seems that the tide may be turning on this front. 
Some of the recent initiatives that demonstrate this renewed leadership role include: 
a continued effort to enhance the health status of First Nations.  
Let me share some of my thoughts on this question.  
It is an essential business on which millions of people depend. 
It is a major employer. 
Its workforce is made up of dedicated, highly motivated and well-trained people. 
It is a business profoundly affected by both demographic and technological change.  
Unfortunately, however, this business is in deep trouble. 
Its clients are changing, as are their needs. 
At the same time, its revenue base is shrinking. 
Part of its service delivery is marked by overcapacity or by undercapacity. 
The different parts of the business have grown in isolation from each other. 
In the worst case scenario, this business risks complete collapse. 
Honourable senators, let us be clear:
There is no one solution to the challenges that lie before us. 
We do not need to spend more on health care. 
We do not need more studies on how to improve health status. 
There has been a notable absence of any kind of long-range planning. 
We need to do - and can do - much better.  
One of the biggest challenges will be to involve the public in the change process. 
The public sector could learn a great deal from the private sector. 
How does it differ from the status quo? 
What can we expect to do with it? 
Is the Canada Health Act a limiting factor in creating real change? 
Has the time come to revisit the act? 
This could be done in the spirit of respecting and reinforcing it.  
The issues we need to confront are complex and inter-related. 
Alone, they do not have much impact. 
We need to find a way to bring these initiatives together. 
There is no mechanism to evaluate these projects. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Mira Spivak , pursuant to notice of March 9, 1999, moved: 
They were appalled, because caffeine is a drug. 
It is a drug that can cause addiction. 
It is the only psychoactive drug that can be legally sold to children. 
Those facts alone demand that drug regulators be cautious.  
These are the known adverse effects on healthy adults. 
Most of us can remember when caffeine was off limits for children. 
There was some wisdom in that old saying. 
Six of the seven most popular selling soft drinks contain caffeine. 
Some of the adverse health effects on kids are obvious. 
Two studies have recorded caffeine withdrawal symptoms among children. 
I say: "Prove it."  
The "no increase" argument is Pepsi's argument. 
It is the argument of a very aggressive marketeer. 
That is a specious argument. 
I hope that some Senate committee will investigate the approval of caffeine.  
His officials now tell me that there will be a thorough evaluation. 
He is also considering an external review. 
We have competent evaluators within Health Canada. 
We have people who raise legitimate issues of public health. 
It only helps the manufacturer.  
Why must there be caffeine in those drinks?  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Human Rights in Tibet 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino , pursuant to notice of March 11, 1999, moved: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted to add to the motion?  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Tibet, the peaceful buffer state, has been transformed into an armed camp.  
The Dalai Lama realizes this as, I suspect, do the Chinese. 
Did they speak about Tibet? 
Premier Zhu says that there is religious freedom in Tibet. 
Yet, this is exactly the case in Tibet.  
It is about values. 
However, time has not brought legitimacy. 
In fact, the opposite has been the case. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a question of the honourable senator.  
Honourable senators, without hesitation, I say "yes."  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, April 21, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
