The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Indeed, governments at all levels have a duty to act and to act promptly.  
We cannot long endure.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
These catholic magazines are Canadian at their heart and soul. 
Canadian magazines are not protected by singling out catholic publications for destruction. 
MARY'S CHILDREN'S CHOIR 
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
The choir has recently finished recording its second professional CD. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
This contest is sponsored by the Kitchener Waterloo Multicultural Centre. 
The winning brochure will be printed and distributed across the Waterloo region. 
The hon. member for Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Military scientists placed mustard gas on Mr. Flander's arms. 
They instructed him to walk through gas chambers. 
They drove him into a field and dropped gas all over him. 
His mother and two sons died without ever knowing what caused them.  
The hon. member for Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge.  
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
That tragedy came to symbolize the major risks shipping held for the environment.  
An inexperienced captain is exposed to many dangers. 
Today I want to thank these pilots and to salute them.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Therefore the moratorium on offshore drilling should continue.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Four years ago it was civil war in Bosnia. 
Today it is civil war in Kosovo. 
The concern that the war in Kosovo might spread beyond the borders is very real. 
The fear of yet another humanitarian disaster in the Balkans is pressing upon us.  
Under these conditions NATO interventions are necessary. 
CARREFOUR DE L'ENTREPRISE ET DE L'EMPLOI 
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
All job seekers are welcome.  
I have accepted the position of honourary chair of the event. 
My congratulations to the team of organizers at Cible retour a l'emploi.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
There have been no briefings to parliament and no debates. 
Will the real minister of defence please stand?  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia have begun. 
We understand that Canadian CF-18s will be involved. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Unfortunately, this military campaign could turn into a long one. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am happy with the question from the Leader of the Opposition. 
That did not exist before 1993. We will have a debate in this House. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are available if we can play a role. 
There is already a mechanism established for that.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The way this whole mess could have been cleared up would be very simple. 
There is no inquiry to hide behind.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
But that is their way. 
Yesterday I gave all of the answers I could. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He could table all the documents and the information that is available. 
There are so many questions and so few answers. 
If he is so proud of those deals, where are the details?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They all do that for their ridings. 
I do that for my riding because it is my duty. 
I will not apologize to anybody for being a good member of parliament.  
CANADIAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre, Lib.):
I find the Bloc Quebecois' actions regrettable.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
How many points did each of the proposals receive? 
What did each of the committees recommend?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
He defined it as a place that invites those approaching it. 
Those are his words.  
As a contradiction, is- 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, let us clarify one thing. 
Let us get rid of the big lie tactics of this- 
That is not acceptable parliamentary language. 
I would like the minister to withdraw, please.  
I will withdraw, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
How does he explain that?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a very simple explanation. 
There was no reversal.  
The evaluations of those four separate evaluation teams were all brought together. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
It is clear that the dictator's paranoia was about political embarrassment. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Hughes will evaluate the evidence and issue a report.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What were those phone calls about? 
Did the Prime Minister promise to spare Suharto any political embarrassment?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I am a little surprised with his question.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Let me help her out.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
It is these kinds of discrepancies which have to be cleared up quickly.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
What we want is to create jobs where unemployment levels are too high.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Does the Prime Minister not see the conflict here? 
Why is the Prime Minister delaying getting this thing cleared up?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is not the case. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is all about humanitarian needs. 
This is to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. 
Our people are well trained and equipped. 
They are professional people. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouta-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There are certainly not enormous problems in this regard.  
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
A Gradual Slide Toward the Bottom''.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I am hearing from this minister. 
He is admitting they have interfered in the business of Statistics Canada.  
This is the government's approach to information. 
First it attacks Terry Milewski. 
It fires the chief actuary of the Canada pension plan. 
Is this the government's new approach to information management, censorship?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
There is a thought loose over there somewhere, Mr. Speaker. 
Industry Canada is not independent. 
That includes investment in research and development, learning- 
The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We are at this very moment reviewing that decision. 
We will be discussing this matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs. 
I will be discussing the matter with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Does Health Canada still support the WHO code? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada still very much supports the code. 
That is what we have done. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Since then his own department's economists wrote a paper verifying those facts.  
Why did the minister block the distribution of that report?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
There is trouble with the facts over there, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Why is the minister blocking the reports he does not like?  
Hon. John Manley (Ottawa South, Lib.):
That is bizarre, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
What is going on? 
The hon. Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
That is the position of this government. 
We will continue to work to develop a freshwater strategy.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
I can guarantee that statement will be removed today.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Homelessness is a national problem. 
It is true that I will be going to Toronto tomorrow. 
We took part in a symposium on Dr. Golden's report. 
I believe it is important for me to go tomorrow to discuss these issues. 
I intend to travel throughout Canada, not just to Toronto.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
That is why we led a women's mission exclusively to Washington.  
We very much look forward to these initiatives.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this case is absolutely clear. 
It has followed the usual procedures absolutely. 
We will absolutely respect it as we always do.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, dairy producers are concerned about the future of their sector. 
My question is for the agriculture minister. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are constantly being called upon to go back to passive assistance. 
We are aware that we must continue to help this country's unemployed. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
My department will put all the documents at his disposal, should he so wish.  
The strength of this program lies in consultation with the people in the community. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The Export Development Corporation has enhanced the benefits which it provides. 
The hon. member for Compton-Stanstead.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
My department will be completely at his disposal if he so desires.

Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It was only the President of Yugoslavia who refused to depart from his intransigent position.  
We denied landing rights to airplanes. 
Every day the situation has grown worse and more and more civilians suffer.  
I also want to say that we have acted to ensure the safety of Canadians.  
Humanitarian considerations are the main impulse for our action. 
We remain very concerned about potential atrocities. 
Make no mistake about that.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Unfortunately efforts to achieve a peaceful political solution have failed to this point.  
Our CF-18s have been in Aviano since June of last year. 
This operation is not without risk. 
There are escort aircraft, for example, when our jet fighters are out on missions.  
I have confidence in our people. 
Also, our support and thoughts are with their families in Canada. 
We wish them a safe return.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We have been provided with an explanation of Canadian policy toward the conflict.  
I am here because I believe in this country. 
Let me very briefly address those points. 
They are not Iraqis. 
They are quite different in how they might respond. 
History tells us that. 
What will happen next?  
Will this engagement go further than that? 
We also have to ask about the role of parliament in this whole issue. 
We are talking about the sons and daughters of many of our constituents. 
This is the reality of the international system. 
The rhetoric of soft power cannot hide these simple facts.  
May they all return safely.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Only the Kosovar separatists signed. 
The international community will lose all credibility if it does not act immediately. 
What will happen if the conflict drags on? 
However, the hostilities with the former Yugoslavia are real. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
The Albanian Kosovars have signed and accepted this settlement.  
The present situation in Kosovo is indeed unacceptable. 
We see villages in flames and refugees fleeing in terror. 
Serbian offences against the Albanian Kosovars continue as we speak. 
It was not unfortunately the United Nations at that time, it was NATO.  
We urge the Government of Canada to seek his extradition as well. 
The possible NATO air strikes against the Serbian government are unprecedented. 
Slobodan Milosevic has systematically refused to engage in dialogue and compromise. 
He has continued his reign of terror in Kosovo against ethnic Albanians.  
These are strong, deeply held views and they must be respected.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Let there be no mistake. 
We have just launched an air attack with our allies on a sovereign state.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Of course, we did that yesterday in the House of Commons.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
The other petition is one that will probably surprise you, Mr. Speaker. 
I have a petition signed by 104 Canadians calling for the abolition of the Senate. 
I can even see the Liberal whip shaking his head in acknowledgement of that. 
The petitioners say it should be abolished. 
With great pride I table this petition. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The first petition is on the subject matter of human rights. 
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 120- Mr. Mike Scott: 
Question No. 143- Mr. Paul Forseth: 
Question No. 156- Ms. Wendy Lill: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
This has created a lot of confusion. 
Choices You Can Bank On''. 
We examined it and we put forward recommendations which our party supports.  
There are going to be basically two types of foreign branches in Canada. 
I am sure that will be their target. 
We do not want to mislead Canadian consumers, the retail consumers. 
Foreign branch banking will primarily be setting up in Canada to service the commercial business. 
Not only do we think it is good legislation. 
It is no wonder. 
That legislation simply was not in place.  
I can certainly say that.  
I am sure he is very proud of that. 
The government can take a giant step by getting rid of the overlap. 
It would be a cost saving step.  
I am not afraid to talk about that for two reasons. 
It talked about it in 1996. 
The then secretary of state he said he would do it. 
We are happy about that.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like the ask the hon. member a brief question.  
We allow mergers in one sector when we will not allow mergers in another sector.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
It may fill a void. 
Yes, this is more competition indeed.  
It has been doing it now, but there are some big changes to be made. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot let this opportunity pass without making a comment.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
They are leaders in the way they run their operations. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I know that he comes from a rural area. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
There are 2.4 million SMBs in Canada. 
Small businesses are highly dependent on the chartered banks for financing. 
This dependence has been increasing over the past few years. 
The situation is even worse in areas located outside financial centres. 
Our government again has responded.  
Compared to other industrialized nations, Canada is falling behind. 
This will provide new sources of capital for small and medium size businesses.  
This will further encourage greater competition in Canada's financial services sector.  
In conclusion, the bill benefits all consumers of banking services. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We did not agree with the proposal to have the banks merge.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
They will be able to deal with the people who have $150,000 to deposit. 
This was to teach us to save. 
Teller did things for people. 
There are still some banks that do that, some individual bank locations. 
There are two things here. 
There is no debate before the government signs these agreements. 
Then what we get here is an agreement that is already signed. 
Certainly it was mandatory in the United States.  
What happened in Canada? 
We just issued a press release. 
It is a quasi religious experience to be at a WTO meeting. 
It is not working. 
Are we doing this just because we want to be nice guys? 
We recognize the situation in which these countries have found themselves. 
They are in a hole which they have a hard time getting out of. 
Many of these countries need to have that. 
It is not just for that. 
What do these countries do? 
This is part of the problem with the international financial system. 
They have to pay these debts in hard currency. 
In order to get hard currency they have to export. 
We cannot drink the water. 
But the banks will be okay. 
That is one of the commandments. 
Thou shalt not make a graven image. 
Thou shalt not have false gods before me. 
We cannot control anything. 
The list goes on and on.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
They voted for that particular motion by my New Democratic colleague. 
There is some truth in that. 
We are talking about an international tax. 
The member has set up a straw man and then conveniently knocked him down. 
Unfortunately for him, I am not a straw man.  
I never said it would solve everything. 
I never said anything of the kind. 
If he is for that, good for him. 
As for me, I would rather drive them out of the temples.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Obviously, this needs a starting point. 
I wanted simply to clarify that. 
But the government does not vote for everything. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
It is a step in the right direction.  
I listened to the member with some interest. 
Mr. Speaker, yes, I was painting a very gloomy picture. 
I am talking particularly about the WTO. 
Things that this parliament has done have been literally struck down by these international organizations. 
There is a long list. 
We have lost it to polling. 
We have lost it to the media.  
There is a lot to be gloomy about as parliamentarians. 
At least you always knew where the Tories were coming from. 
They were coming right at you with a machete.  
I feel a little gloomy about it. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
This House is a better place due to his presence. 
As he was saying, he has been here for 20 years.  
He makes me very proud to be a member of the United Church of Canada. 
Much of this change that is occurring is technologically based. 
It is very difficult for small business to attain financing.  
In this legislation, the government has made a baby step to address this. 
In 1997 Wells Fargo had about 10,000 customers in Canada. 
By 1998 that had grown to 120,000. 
Much of that is in small business lending.  
It is occurring and the competition is growing. 
They dominate the TSE.  
All these things should occur as parallel initiatives.  
I spoke earlier about small business. 
There is a risk and reward question here.  
It is very important. 
In Canada the TSE has gained by about 60%. 
I believe that is the latest factor. 
It could not just be a marketing ploy. 
They would continue their services to rural Canada.  
For instance, they committed to doubling their small business lending. 
I think that a lot of that stuff was positive.  
Now we are seeing banks closing branches. 
We are seeing on an ongoing basis services threatened.  
We will see how well that decision ages.  
The cost of the banks' money for capital goes up. 
The banks will pass that on to consumers. 
The effects could be quite significant. 
All these things have to occur quickly. 
The other was those proposed bank merger announcements. 
It kind of pushed the envelope and brought this debate forward.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I draw attention to one item in his speech. 
Are the competitive incentives there?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his typically erudite intervention. 
Wells Fargo has discovered a niche in that area.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
They voted for it because it is a tax. 
There simply was not any logical reason to do it.  
He has this leadership thing coming up and everything. 
I think the minister thought it was a Tobin attack. 
The speculators saw a huge opportunity. 
Those economies ultimately were not sustainable with that.  
The way that kind of speculation occurred, sometimes can be considered to be very negative. 
Look at what happened in Orange county, California. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wanted to ask a question of the member for Kings-Hants. 
I wanted to make that point.  
There is no question that this is an important area. 
Capital gains taxes and the lifetime exemption have gone away now. 
For instance, Wells Fargo is in the business of electronic banking over the Internet. 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
He has not given a complete speech. 
Almost nothing is required to get on the list. 
My dog received an application for a MasterCard. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
Virtually all organizations now have their own marquee card. 
This is a very large business.  
Our banks are dealing with the issues. 
Who knows what happens after this. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The other day we lost the Canadarm from Spar to the Americans. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House resumed from February 8 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The member has put forward an interesting motion. 
He is proposing that we influence human behaviour by the manipulation of the tax code. 
There is a deep philosophical question here:
On the other hand, the employee would receive it as a non-taxable benefit. 
That is the way I understand the motion.  
I have a prior aversion to using the tax code to manipulate human behaviour.  
I know members will appreciate this. 
However, I found it very convenient. 
It was an excellent physical workout. 
It must have cost millions of dollars.  
In fact I might have even gone so far as to say it was required. 
In principle the motion contains some very worthy goals. 
However, I have a bit of a problem with respect to the application of it. 
It was pretty well a 50:50 split on my incremental income. 
We are overtaxed in this country.  
The other problem that I have is with respect to accessibility.  
I know I need the exercise. 
Perhaps we should be looking at that as well. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Our trade minister said this in Ottawa in 1997. 
It is absolutely abominable that these corporations can get away with that.  
Many employers would love to give this benefit to their employees. 
They do not have to worry about getting into their car in the morning. 
They do not have to worry about finding a parking space. 
The employees would save a tremendous amount of wear and tear on their vehicles.  
It would be an absolutely wonderful thing for our environment.  
We have been getting a lot of occurrences of road rage. 
I have even missed a plane because of it. 
That would benefit all of us.  
It would also be a drastic decrease in our dependence on fossil fuels. 
We would not have to destroy the planet. 
Maybe we could actually leave something for our great-grandchildren. 
I believe most employers would honour this type of motion.  
It would create employment for their long term security. 
Maybe they could even go and have a glass of beer now and then. 
Who knows what students do these days? 
We would have to ask the pages.  
It is an individual decision.  
It is one that should get the unanimous consent of everybody in this House.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
In Canada we have quite a challenge ahead of us. 
Transportation generally accounts for one quarter of all greenhouse gases. 
In fact, public transit has become a key issue. 
North Americans have a real love affair with automobiles. 
The issue tables are going to report in the fall. 
It seems from the study that the benefits far outweigh the downside. 
This motion is timely. 
It has to be carried out. 
These costs are never accounted for in our taxation system. 
It is fitting and propitious that it is before us today. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
We will support this motion because this is a win win win situation. 
It is a reality. 
Support for this initiative continues to grow steadily. 
Encouraging the use of public transit is no longer viewed solely as a transit issue. 
It is a proposal that makes sense. 
All other revenue is not lost but forgone.  
Taxation is already effectively used to discourage some behaviour while encouraging others. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It gets people thinking. 
Motions are not binding on the government. 
It is quite straightforward. 
I want to speak in favour of this motion. 
The Government of Canada has announced the establishment of a climate change secretariat. 
We have done a number of things which I think will advance the issues. 
It is not part of the problem. 
It is an interesting perspective to raise.  
I am aware of a couple of arguments that could be opposed. 
The one about being premature is a valid argument. 
That is quite true. 
Does everybody have to be treated exactly the same? 
Or, is it that we are trying to promote equity or equality of benefits? 
I suspect that is the case. 
Maybe people have made up their minds. 
The laws of Canada are by their very nature discriminatory. 
They have to be discriminatory. 
Dentists et cetera have brought this to us. 
There is a discrimination there.  
There must be at least a dozen different angles or issues on this. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I will just make a couple of key points.  
This is certainly one way of doing that. 
I want to thank the House for these few minutes. 
I commend my hon. colleague. 
Hopefully the House will support the motion unanimously.  
It being 6.30 p.m., the time provided for debate has expired.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I represent my constituents in this House. 
When the minister accuses me of making false statements, he is calling my constituents liars. 
I checked the Internet, found the application forms and counted the pages for myself. 
There are 50 pages, not 40.  
The minister's statement is an absolute falsehood.  
These forms are directly tied to NISA. 
The whole package could have been much simpler.  
Farmers are telling me that when they see the forms, they get extremely frustrated. 
This final point is very key.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The hon. member for Yorkton-Melville has stated 40 to 50 pages. 
The rest are instructions. 
The actual form is from five to seven pages.  
Everyone with a farm business has this information already on hand.  
This year the tax forms also serve as the NISA application. 
The forms now fill three functions. 
There is a limited amount of supplementary information required for AIDA. 
Let me provide two examples.  
Second, those in difficulty will leave bills unpaid. 
This must be reflected to determine the true loss.  
The cost of hiring an accountant need not be overly excessive. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, various Liberal members like to claim that they are friends of the farmers. 
The minister says that the program will not cover losses or negative margins. 
These farmers say that this program will do nothing for them.  
That is not fair. 
In turn, it is much less than what they had spent in 1993. 
It is time for Ottawa to put back money into agriculture. 
We in the NDP believe that Canadian farmers need stable incomes. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
This is quite an achievement.  
The national program will not be delivered in isolation of its existing instruments. 
This encourages farmers to get actively involved in the management of their own risks.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
The Minister of Industry replied to my question. 
He did not answer satisfactorily in my opinion. 
On several occasions, I had questioned him in committee.  
What can we do? 
I am particularly pleased at how this issue has brought people together. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
It is the trustee who has the final say. 
Consequently, there is no conflict of interest.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.51 p.m.)
