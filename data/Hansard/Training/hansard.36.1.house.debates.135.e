The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
REPORTS OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND OSFI 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
This bill concerns advertising services provided by foreign periodical publishers.  
CANADA ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTION ACT 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
The report received quite a bit of attention, as everyone knows. 
I see the parliamentary secretary shaking his head. 
I am not quite sure.  
Get your facts straight.  
It is where juvenile fish grow. 
It has great feeding potential. 
Fish grow very well there. 
What has Canada done? 
It is the first time. 
It is now an area known as 3MA.  
That is still debatable.  
We are dealing with facts, not fiction.  
He still knows more about potatoes than he knows about fish.  
This is a very disturbing situation for a number of reasons. 
Where did they get this frozen flatfish? 
They got the flatfish as a bycatch for cod. 
The parliamentary secretary shakes his head. 
He shakes his head a lot these days. 
He shakes, shakes and shakes his head.  
The hon. member keeps shouting ``misinformation''. 
The hon. member cannot deny the obvious. 
A lot of people have their you know what in the wringer over this situation. 
Everyone that came to our meetings recommended that. 
Why the government did not accept that recommendation I will never understand. 
There could have been a redirection inside the fund to take care of this problem.  
There is a very serious situation unfolding in Atlantic Canada today. 
I know about the riding of Burin-St. 
They have always gone to Ontario, British Columbia or Alberta. 
It has been part of our life. 
However, in the rural communities of Burin-St. 
Most of them are 50 years of age plus. 
Most of them are retired people or the few who hold government jobs.  
He tried to downplay the report. 
He did not take the recommendations of the committee very seriously.  
What did the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans do? 
The report from the committee generated a lot of attention in Atlantic Canada. 
There were 15 public meetings. 
They have no reason to mislead me. 
I am one of them. 
I grew up with them. 
I am concerned about them. 
They tell me there are good signs of fish in the southern zones.  
There are some very good earnings. 
We may not have 100% observer coverage after two years. 
The foreigners may reject it in two years. 
That is what I am told. 
I am not saying it is correct. 
I am told that in two years it is up for review. 
The parliamentary secretary will have an occasion to respond to my remarks. 
If I am wrong he can set the record straight.  
It will take me all day.  
He knows full well.  
We do not get to see the observer reports. 
They can tell us what they like.  
They were offered to you in camera.  
I refuse to accept the observer reports in camera. 
I do not want to see them for my information. 
I want to tell Atlantic Canadians and all other Canadians what is in them.  
They are the people who deserve to know. 
Satisfying my curiosity is not good enough. 
I represent 158 communities in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
These people want to know what is in the observer reports. 
It is the government's way of covering it up. 
It is like paying Jesse James to be security at a bank. 
Jesse would argue that he did not steal any money. 
The salmon fishing has increased. 
All they do is take out.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
George's paints it in terms of the minister's response. 
There was an excellent response to a number of points.  
The member is shaking his head; he knows that. 
The member talked a bit about this point. 
There is confidential commercial information in those observer reports. 
The opposition parties really should have looked at the reports. 
Those are the facts.  
I believe that the member for Burin-St. 
George's indicated that he knew of two people who are interested. 
Maybe they could get their allocation.  
The member talked about the- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member has used up half the time already. 
The hon. member for St. John's East may wish to respond. 
If not, I will go to another member who wishes to comment.  
Mr. Speaker, it is Burin-St. 
This is a very serious situation. 
I say to the parliamentary secretary that is what is going to happen. 
There is no protection. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my colleague from Burin-St. 
I certainly agree with the comments he has made today.  
This is an unbelievable statement. 
He should go back to growing spuds.  
The member for Burin-St. 
They are good for fisheries in Canada.  
The member for Burin-St. 
That the House do now proceed to orders of the day.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
This bill is entitled:
It cleans out a lot of our penal law system.  
This is an omnibus bill. 
The first part I am going to address deals with casinos on cruise ships. 
I will give a brief historical review. 
I would like to speak to this briefly.  
In 1997, the media brought us the Lagana affair. 
This is totally unacceptable to the Bloc Quebecois. 
We will not tolerate other Lagana cases.  
I also want to discuss the powers of the attorney general of Canada.  
However, we feel this is not enough of a justification. 
That was a long time ago.  
The solutions it is proposing do not go nearly far enough.  
The Bloc Quebecois has been raising this whole issue for a long time now. 
This requirement would also apply to casinos and travel agencies.  
Strict measures are long in coming. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This omnibus bill is nevertheless positive legislation. 
I want to state that at the outset. 
I would like to outline some of the significant provisions of this bill. 
This was certainly a situation sadly in need of change. 
Again, I view this as a positive amendment.  
This is a situation I would strongly urge the government to reconsider. 
I view this as positive change. 
With this decision there will be significantly increased traffic on that port. 
It is not a partisan comment on my part. 
That is simply the conclusion that has been reached in examining these facts. 
I do not reach this conclusion alone. 
Sadly, Canadians continue to wait and organized crime continues to penetrate this country.  
That lag time in between does permit for this communication to occur.  
Our party is in support of this particular change. 
The act has been sorely lacking and needs to have a change in this manner.  
Bill C-51 is seen as a positive step forward.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I thank him for his comments. 
Of course, I am in total disagreement with that. 
I would like the member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough to comment, please.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Sackville-Eastern Shore, a fellow Bluenoser. 
In simple terms we have to clean up our backyard first and foremost. 
They had specific training. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
I know he was a prosecutor in his province. 
He would make a great solicitor general in a new government after the next election.  
Canadians are very concerned about crime. 
We only have to look at Bill C-3, the DNA bill.  
It is cosmetic at best and timid in its degree of efficacy in change. 
Bill C-51 could have gone a lot further. 
Does Bill C-51 do anything to allay these fears? 
It is what is not in Bill C-51 that concerns the Reform Party.  
Why would the minister ignore this obvious issue? 
This is the real problem in the area of conditional sentencing. 
Why avoid it again? 
Case after case in this area begs for change. 
Is there any sense of justice or backbone in the government?  
We can be accused in the House of being partisan. 
Chief Justice Catherine Fraser in a decision indicated: 
This was a judge talking about conditional sentencing, not a politician. 
I quote from the Edmonton Journal : 
That is what the justice minister said Thursday. 
She could have made the changes and she did not make the changes. 
That is why the bill is faulty. 
I could go on and on. 
We have all heard of how short some of these sentences really are.  
As one crown attorney said, this does not make any sense. 
The system is losing credibility.  
One judge out of eleven interviewed said: 
Bill C-51 does nothing to solve the problem. 
It is about time we had some real truth in sentencing. 
It could start with Bill C-51 if the government had the will. 
We will move amendments, hoping the government has the will.  
I will discuss another story in relation to conditional sentencing. 
Bill C-51 does nothing to solve that problem. 
We are going to make amendments to it. 
He was sentenced by a judge to 13 years. 
What does he get? 
Two years and two months.  
That shows young people that a life of crime pays. 
It creates career criminals. 
Will this man go back to an honest job? 
He was freed after only one year. 
Why would we treat them that way? 
It is better than before. 
It is objectionable, unacceptable and naive. 
Organized crime laughs at going to jail for a couple of years.  
Mr. Speaker, I am sure you like going to the movies. 
That is very serious stuff. 
In short, these people should be held for their full sentences. 
Serious crime, serious time. 
We have to get that message across to organized crime.  
There should be no exception for organized crime. 
All Canadians say wonderful, that is great. 
The fact is no one changes the penalty. 
Too many young children in our big cities today are getting into child prostitution. 
It is happening too often in our cities today. 
My party will put those amendments in the proper place.  
Around and around the charade goes. 
Give with one hand, take away with the other. 
This ensures inertia, which is a specialty of the government. 
It is time to get serious with child prostitution. 
As my colleague says, there is just no value on life. 
Why does it take so long? 
It is absolutely incredible.  
Unfortunately Mr. Ward died 14 months after the vicious attack. 
In March 1997 the former minister of justice promised to change the law. 
It was reiterated by the current minister in September 1997. 
Why did the current minister wait so long? 
It does not get out of the way. 
It certainly does not lead but it is pretty good at following. 
The government's delay is inexcusable. 
A good bill will die and that is unfortunate.  
There is not a lot to support in this dog's breakfast of amendments. 
Many support a triple E Senate. 
How about a triple E justice system, effective, efficient and equitable. 
It is time we get started.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
One could call it a tutti-frutti bill. 
It tries to cover all the bases. 
I would like to list some of the amendments.  
The section in question is the one on cruise ship casinos. 
It is therefore quite clear how much Quebec City was at a disadvantage.  
Let us now look at how the proposed legislative amendment will remedy the situation. 
So, we are very pleased with that provision.  
They were all behind us to have the legislation changed.  
I sat on the committee. 
Here again, we feel the government is not going far enough. 
Granted, this would be a major change. 
In Bill C-51, the government wants to correct this situation. 
This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois will not stand for another case like that of Lagana. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
It is an attempt to respond to the changing conditions within our society. 
Much of what is being proposed is long overdue. 
Canadians must wonder why these issues have not been addressed before now. 
It concerns invasion of privacy under part VI of the code.  
I suppose this falls into the category of ``better late than never''.  
Dice games will now be permitted and will be managed by the provinces and territories.  
I will be interested in the justice committee review of this legislation.  
It will be interesting to see just how this has occurred.  
Bill C-51 proposes to amend section 212(4) of the code. 
A number of thoughts cross my mind when I look at this. 
Nevertheless there was soon public outrage over the weakness of the legislation. 
Reality, what a concept.  
Perhaps they should consider truth in sentencing. 
It is the largest detachment of the RCMP in Canada. 
My constituents would like some answers.  
He has been requesting a meeting with the solicitor general to discuss these funding problems. 
Maybe they could meet on an airplane.  
Some elements are long overdue and that is a travesty in itself. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my hon. colleague and friend this question. 
We should be building up our police forces, not cutting them back.  
Mr. Speaker, I would certainly agree with that. 
We are certainly going in the wrong direction. 
The surge in gang organized crime on the west coast is phenomenal. 
It is completely out of control. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We should hit it right at the source. 
Would that not alleviate some of the problems we are facing?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
We have to do something about the importation of drugs.  
I think it has to be a concerted attack on the international scene. 
We have to start at the top.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We all know that it is a habit that is very addictive. 
It is such a devastating thing for health reasons and also for costs.  
Between the two of them they were putting almost three packs a day away.  
I had a number of students tell me they were going to change. 
That is the financial cost of smoking. 
Maybe that is going to come. 
Very little has been done. 
I do not think that is a good principle. 
I am not certain whether the whole act of smoking should be illegal. 
This is a question one really needs to ask. 
For example, we have people advertising certain foods. 
I have tried to say no to food lately. 
This must be true confession time on nationwide television. 
I don't remember. 
I did so all alone. 
Self, I think this is stupid. 
I am fairly old now and that probably happened about 50 years ago. 
It had to do simply with an intelligent decision. 
To this day I am very grateful that I made that decision.  
I do not like to use the word hypocritical. 
That is the definition of a hypocrite. 
To me that it is hypocritical. 
I do not believe that we ought to approve this particular bill. 
We should be opposing it because of its lack of clarity. 
This should include actual visits to hospitals. 
They had to visit those relatives. 
They saw how they were breathing through a tracheal tube. 
They saw how they were unable to speak because of throat cancer. 
They saw firsthand the devastation. 
We have to stop thinking that way. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
The original Tobacco Act was assented to in April 1997. 
I was one of the members in the House at the time. 
To my knowledge the government still has not answered that question.  
I hope there are people taking steps to do exactly that.  
In the meantime we have governments pandering to the tobacco industry. 
I would often get calls at my riding office. 
As we know, the tobacco companies were successful in striking down those provisions. 
It simply does not make sense.  
Then of course there is chewing tobacco, which some people might choose to chew. 
There has been promotion of this certainly at the corner stores in the Vancouver area. 
There are display stands of chewing tobacco. 
This is simply moving the problem around within the human body. 
He talked about several of the amendments and points that were suggested. 
It is worthwhile reviewing some of those points. 
It should be reduced significantly.  
The Canadian Cancer Society has put a lot of thought into the recommendations. 
I did not read out all the details. 
I know this was read into the record last week. 
Our borders are so porous criminals can come and go at any time they like.  
It identified them as Iranian passports. 
How did this passport get here? 
As I said, the North Shore News carried the story yesterday. 
That is all she needs to do. 
It is so simple. 
That is all it would take.  
They like to have the T-1000 form in there. 
I say too bad. 
Really it comes down to political will.  
If there was political will to address the problem it would be addressed. 
People can openly cause our young people to be addicted to tobacco. 
In fact, everything said here is almost irrelevant.  
I will close with one last appeal to people here. 
I urge all members to vote against this bill.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
I wonder if the member could make a comment about that in terms of priorities.  
The Montreal Gazette had a story on August 30 concerning this bill. 
So what do you do about that? 
We have to pour some money into contradicting the advertising of the tobacco companies. 
Frankly, that is an insult. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Canadian grain is recognized around the world for its quality. 
Yet in spite of this impressive performance Canadian farmers are facing a severe economic crisis. 
What is responsible for this serious deterioration in prices? 
Farmers are asking what this government is going to do to correct the situation. 
Where are the minister of agriculture and the Minister for International Trade? 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Family Savings and Credit Union is kicking off its 50th anniversary celebrations. 
INTERNATIONAL PLOWING MATCH AND FARM MACHINERY SHOW 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
I personally thank all the hundreds of volunteers. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
We were impressed with progressive attitudes and careful forest practices. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
This year, we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of TV5 Quebec Canada. 
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
This centre brings together the finest scholars in the world.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
It is served by the detachment in Rankin Inlet 100 kilometres away. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
But today, the truth is coming out once again.  
I want to congratulate the member for Rimouski-Mitis. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this week is Community Newspaper Week. 
Each newspaper is unique, as is the community that it represents. 
Together, they make a major contribution to the vitality of the Canadian community.  
MENTAL ILLNESS AWARENESS WEEK 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
This public education campaign was launched in 1992 to de-stigmatize mental illness. 
Serious mental illnesses such as major depression involve substantial personal and socioeconomic costs.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It is called ``Keepers of the Past''.  
It may have been a church or a school or a hall 
Now, it houses memories and bits of history for recall.  
Treasured possessions preserved through the years 
In this hallowed place, ably manned by volunteers 
Dusty antiques, all rusty and old 
Tin type photos with a story to be told.  
Keepers of the past-a rich heritage 
For generations to come, of a more modern age 
Community pride-of this I can attest 
For Souris-Moose Mountain has some of the best.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, ``we must grant that recognition''. 
Our new country would finally be a full fledged member of the international community.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
The record speaks for itself. 
The world community values our contribution. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that was the good news. 
Now the bad news. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member shows a very misguided sense of priorities in her question. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That is great, Mr. Speaker. 
The commission is going to hear this motion on Tuesday. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This is getting more serious by the day. 
The government cannot have it both ways. 
It cannot cherry pick. 
It has already acknowledged that the member for Palliser has it right.  
The minister can run from the truth but he cannot hide from the facts. 
So there is only one question left. 
When will he resign?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
In jurisprudence there is an expression, notes taken at the time. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is an independent body. 
It wants to do its work. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I will continue to do that.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
They are the only people in Canada who are very proud of him.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, quite the contrary. 
I discuss it regularly. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Why the double standard?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
I would swear under oath that I am telling the truth. 
The solicitor general, better than anyone else, knows what happened.  
Will he now withdraw his allegation?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on the contrary. 
That report has been discredited. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The question as put is in order.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
There are many inaccuracies in that report. 
I stand by my story.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw and I will go directly to the question.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
He is a fine minister and he is doing a good job.  
I guess the hon. member does not care about veterans any more. 
What happened to her priority with respect to veterans? 
What happened to her party's concern about the economy? 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Will he change his mind and now ask for the resignation of the solicitor general?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the situation here is extremely clear.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The hon. member for Roberval.  
He is the one responsible for state secrets. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is what Solicitors General have to learn, and this one did not.  
The hon. Solicitor General.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
How things change after five years in office.  
Canadians no longer have confidence in the Solicitor General, who is still with us. 
Why is the government not keeping its word?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very clear what is happening. 
It turned up across an aisle as St. Michael's. 
That is just an example.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
When will the Prime Minister ask the minister for his resignation?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
How low does the bar have to go, Mr. Prime Minister?  
I remind members to please address your questions to the Chair.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The results of that exercise have been discredited in fact. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
As a consequence the hon. member has mentioned the facility. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The minister has arrived at that point. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have more respect for fundamental justice than to do that.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Why the double standard?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, there are double standards around here lately.  
In one conversation the solicitor general destroyed that trust. 
He cannot separate the private from the public.  
When will the solicitor general resign?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, serious allegations were made. 
I stood in the House. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, would you allow the member to repeat the question?  
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I want to check the facts on this letter.  
Mr. Toole's letter does not corroborate the solicitor general's story. 
The letter is very carefully and legally crafted by a lawyer to say nothing.  
The question as it is put is in order.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I am simply questioning the accuracy of his hearing.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I believe profoundly in fundamental justice. 
I think it is being convoluted in this place to impugn my integrity. 
In the name of my integrity, I remain the Solicitor General of Canada.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
The member for Palliser could not make this up. 
In fact, he heard all too well the solicitor general breaking secrets in public. 
Will he recognize his error in judgment? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I never suggested that he made it up. 
He just got it wrong.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for asking the question again. 
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Next week is the Thanksgiving break. 
Tuesday, October 20 shall be an allotted day.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
What I asked, and I am prepared to table the text of the question, is- 
Does the hon. member have the permission of the House to table the document?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I ask that an order of the day be designated for consideration of the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Standing Order 83(1): states: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
However, I believe we will be resuming debate.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
This bill is very close to me at this time. 
My colleague from Elk Island did not want to use the word hypocrisy. 
I have to use that word for this reason. 
It did not want to do that. 
It created a double standard. 
The rule of law did not apply in Canada.  
The government continues to justify that.  
Let me tell members about an incident in my life. 
My brother was 49 years old. 
Today I have another family member who is in serious trouble health wise.  
The government failed to recognize what the cancer societies said. 
It failed to recognize what the Health Association of Canada said. 
No, the government has to do it its way.  
All people in Canada know that. 
The Canadian Cancer Society knows it. 
Immediately the government has shied away from what it promised. 
This is not what it promised. 
Bill C-42 is the height of hypocrisy. 
The government and the Minister of Health cannot deny that.  
The Minister of Health is in a very uncomfortable position with this bill. 
That in itself is an act of hypocrisy of the highest degree.  
However, when it needs more money, does anyone know what it will do? 
Canadians know what it will do. 
I have lost relatives to tobacco. 
I have seen many young people destroy their lives with tobacco. 
I cannot understand it and I do not think they do.  
Let every member who votes in this House examine themselves. 
They are not justifying it.  
We did not have all of the medical knowledge from the Canadian Cancer Society. 
Never mind the tax revenue. 
Never mind the political grants. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I would like him to explain clearly what he means by that.  
They have told me how they want to vote.  
Make no mistake about it.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
I have heard others in the debate make that comment as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
They want to copy it. 
This bill goes further. 
The Calgary Herald wrote ``The new legislation is workable and defensible''. 
I could go on.  
It has never worked in this country and it is not going to work now. 
Mr. Speaker, I will respond to that. 
It empowers the government to regulate tobacco as a product. 
It makes it an offence to sell tobacco to kids under age 18. 
It puts the tightest restrictions on advertising as well as dealing with sponsorship.  
It is a small part of a large strategy. 
I want the help of governments across the country in achieving that objective.  
Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. minister has spoken. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
It is nice to have a minister in the House. 
He is looking rather relaxed and cool these days. 
We have not been after him very much, but that too will change. 
They are concerned with keeping harmful products, particularly tobacco, away from youth. 
Chewing tobacco has become popular. 
More and more the advertising was scoped to youth. 
They have lots of money. 
It attracts young people. 
Let us not extend this phase in program and let us do the job.  
I think we can relate to that. 
We should work very hard in our approach to changing that.  
In the meantime it is still reaping benefits from the sale of tobacco. 
We would like to see this aspect changed.  
Let us not move the deadline to start implementation further and further away. 
Let us get it into law now. 
There are ways to poll people to find out what people are interested in. 
The agencies can design advertising to do that.  
It gets to become a trademark: if you have one of those you are macho. 
Where does the idea come from that chewing tobacco is cool? 
It comes from advertising. 
The phased in program leaves it open to interpretation. 
Let us stop that aspect of it. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It is something that I agree with in principle. 
Presumably the product is 100% legitimate. 
It is even subsidized by the Government of Canada. 
It seems to me that there is an anomaly.  
Would the member for Lethbridge comment on that? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Elk Island. 
It is a dangerous substance. 
The hon. member is right. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments.  
As a former teacher I taught grade seven students for a number of years. 
Mr. Speaker, I might have alluded to that somewhat in my presentation. 
We should do it, but we should it now. 
This phase-in time is not necessary. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
That should be acknowledged by the members opposite.  
I made the point previously. 
It should have started years ago. 
It should be in effect right now. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, yes there is. 
It is obvious from the stats, and it is especially young girls. 
We have seen this increase recently.  
This legislation should be implemented as quickly as possible. 
We should not have the phase-in period. 
It is important that we start as soon as we can.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I suppose industry giants, corporations are influencing the government. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Right now we are facing a crisis in the agricultural sector. 
My colleague from Selkirk-Interlake is very well aware of that. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am going to make a very short intervention on this bill. 
I am going to ask the minister to get involved again.  
She used those terms. 
We do not know whether it is going to carry through. 
That is the first question.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This is certainly an interesting twist on debate. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is terribly wrong. 
It does anything but. 
The member has it wrong. 
We are doing the right thing. 
He should support this legislation.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I know this is not question period. 
I asked two questions. 
If the minister is going to respond, he should answer those questions. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate this question and I mean that so sincerely.  
We wanted to see it and we still want to see it.  
The member talks about the harm from climate change. 
We know that climate change has happened throughout history. 
We know from records that have been left that climate change has happened. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
The member opposite has inappropriately- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is not a point of order.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, of course the member does not have to respond. 
It is not question period. 
Is the climate change she is anticipating global warming or global cooling? 
I asked her to cite just one solid reference, one source for this information.  
Again, she has refused to give even one reference. 
I guess that shows where this debate is going.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member was not listening. 
As I said, I am more than happy to drown the hon. member in paper. 
There is one very good source, the Canadian Institute of Children's Health. 
Climate change means climate change. 
It is called climate change.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Transnational crime and criminals are now the norm, not the exception. 
Canada's laws must be modernized in recognition of that reality.  
Under the new bill the legal standard for extradition would be retained. 
Lawyers like to refer to this as the prima facie test.  
Those fugitives, therefore, remain at large in our communities.  
With this option the legal test would not change. 
Bill C-40 also includes a number of improvements and safeguards.  
This brings me to the second important feature of this reform. 
The current two-track system will be maintained. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Canada's current policies are outdated, slow and complex. 
We do not know how many or where they are. 
We believe in justice. 
The process to establish such a court has been a very difficult road. 
Canada is one of the 119 signatories to this historic event. 
Now at least if we can find these illegals we have somewhere to send them.  
He says that this is a serious problem. 
The bill is a small part of solving some of that problem.  
Those are the ones we know about. 
That is a pathetic statement about the pathetic immigration system in Canada. 
Our immigration system has played the refugee game with these individuals for too long. 
Bill C-40 changes a 120 year old law. 
I will discuss that later.  
It is nice to know we are getting into the modern age. 
Will the system be less complex? 
Will it be less complex? 
The list of offences varies from country to country.  
This will not just happen. 
This is new territory. 
In fact it is a quantum change. 
I suspect much preparatory work will have to be done.  
Delays have always favoured the accused because witnesses die. 
That does not happen very often. 
Six months is a very short period of time for most of these cases. 
Bill C-40 will be tested. 
I am afraid the bill does not meet that test. 
Why are they going to the Supreme Court? 
They want to stay in Canada. 
Does this law solve that problem? 
I do not think it does.  
These admissions were voluntary.  
It was because Canada had abolished the death penalty. 
If these had been U.S. citizens, the extraditions would have proceeded.  
That story alone should let us know there is a serious problem.  
None of us would respect that. 
This bill is not going solve those problems. 
I have another objection to Bill C-40. 
The bill preserves the minister's discretion in cases. 
This should not be the minister's role. 
This is a judicial role, an independent role.  
The role of the court should be simple in these extradition cases. 
The conduct complained of is a crime in Canada, a very simple rule. 
Again it is very simple. 
There is a valid extradition treaty. 
I have another concern. 
I have some questions about the mechanics and the logistics of Bill C-40. 
These questions are not answered in the bill.  
Who pays any related costs? 
Who pays for the legal defence before the tribunal? 
It had better not be Canada that is on the hook. 
It is not unlike the process right now. 
To an overwhelming majority of Canadians that is just not acceptable.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
That young person is Jude-Etienne Blanchette. 
Let us now turn our attention to Bill C-40. 
A hundred years ago, there was no Internet. 
A hundred years ago, the whole issue of telemarketing did not exist. 
Not a figure to be sneezed at.  
I have forgotten to mention the two lawyers who briefed me. 
I am thinking of Mr. Lemire, and of Mr. Roy. 
I wish to thank them. 
I think they are seated nearby. 
The bill we are discussing, Bill C-40, will combine two statutes. 
I think we will find this flexibility very useful in the future.  
They will also have to assess the evidence, and that is extremely important. 
Then there is the Department of Justice. 
The human authority must take a look at the extradition issue. 
This is something that reaches across borders. 
There are usually three phases. 
I also came to realize that organized crime works in stages or phases. 
The first stage consists in taking control over a territory. 
Members of criminal organization need a place to operate. 
These places meet very specific criteria.  
There is no organized crime to speak of in the third world. 
There is a lot of corruption of course. 
There are a number of prerequisites for organized crime to flourish. 
First, this requires a state with a highly complex legal system. 
I wish our Liberal colleagues could have been there too. 
That said, back to organized crime. 
Canada is the only country to have this denomination.  
The first phase, therefore, is taking over an area. 
The second is money laundering. 
Crime is a very real concern. 
We know how the refugee status determination process works. 
It is a pretty rotten, petty and patronage-ridden system, in my opinion. 
The officer then determines if there is a credible basis for the claim.  
We hope, of course, that the process will change. 
The process should be a lot faster than it is.  
As the member for Jonquiere pointed out, people get used to being here. 
They must then leave the country. 
It is true, particularly through the federal court. 
Some may construe this as interference. 
They probably had more to do with the cost of implementing the legislation. 
We can agree that twho here is work to be done in that area.  
That is not enough. 
We must know when legislation will be tabled. 
The Immigration and Refugee Board is a patronage haven.  
I could give examples. 
There is Mrs. Robic, the former Minister of Immigration for Quebec, for instance. 
That is a good appointment, because she was the Minister of Immigration. 
She was a Liberal, of course, but nobody is perfect.  
Was he interested in immigration? 
That was what the Trempe report called for. 
This is the direction that should be taken. 
Those are my comments. 
Certainly, there will be a few amendments, because we have a dual objective. 
That is what the opposition is all about. 
We will work in committee to improve the bill. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
This is not my area of expertise. 
Obviously that is a limitation that needs to be corrected.  
We are glad to see Bill C-40 coming in to do that.  
We feel that is one of the big benefits. 
The non-publication of evidence provisions has been dealt with in Bill C-40. 
We have some serious concerns about that. 
I would like to add a small anecdotal piece of information. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
PROGRAMS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The motion I am putting forward today reads as follows: 
In the coming minutes, I will explain my reasoning on the merits of this motion.  
That is quite a sum.  
The Youth Employment Strategy combines 250 programs. 
Sometimes several departments share in the funding of a program. 
This can create an accountability problem. 
A number of young people simply do not know about all these programs.  
Young people deserve it.  
I am sure its intentions are good, but the results are sometimes dismal.  
Let us take a look at the current youth employment situation. 
These figures certainly suggest there is a problem.  
There are simply no jobs for them. 
It is also important not to focus exclusively on the government's role. 
I invite members to take a look at these documents.  
Together, these elements help make these people-centred programs particularly effective.  
The government often announces with great fanfare its initiatives for young people. 
Just think of the millennium foundation announced in the last budget. 
Is this a really good investment? 
Members will have figured out that these are hypothetical questions I am asking. 
I also realize that these matters cannot rest solely in the hands of governments. 
Young Canadians are waiting for us to show some leadership. 
Let us not disappoint them.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Certainly young Canadians are looking for results. 
They deserve and expect results.  
I want to explore these two important points one issue at time. 
The first is a matter of program monitoring. 
I will do a quick review of some of our key findings to date. 
I think they will be found very important. 
The youth service Canada program has an equally impressive record. 
The formative evaluation is already in progress. 
This massive undertaking will be completed within two years.  
Our new programs are built around feedback and refinements to these pioneering programs.  
That is important to note.  
Yet we are still not content that enough is being done. 
That is why this year we added the Canadian opportunities strategy as well.  
Do not get me wrong. 
I hope he will recognize that his motion is not necessary. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
In theory, youth programs are aimed at creating jobs. 
Granted, but how many? 
First, it duplicates the Quebec loans and bursaries program. 
The others only give loans.  
This is a totally unacceptable situation, but there is worse.  
This is one of the tangible results of federal budget cuts.  
Let us compare the amounts.  
The figures are just as disturbing with regard to Quebec's fair share. 
Moreover, effectiveness is not the ultimate goal for these programs. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
This was from the mouths of the young people themselves. 
They did not regard government programs as the key.  
Most Canadians would say that the government has failed on this score. 
Where should the government focus its approach? 
They do not believe there is any genuine effort to do that.  
They report experiencing a form of culture shock when they begin their working life. 
We could talk about apprenticeship programs as well.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I was very surprised to hear that.  
Who could disagree with that?  
Unfortunately, the facts present a very gloomy picture for young people.  
That is a drop of over 26,000.  
As we all know, those are only the official numbers. 
The real numbers are much higher.  
It is not a rosy picture at all.  
That is more than double the rate in 1989.  
At the same time there has been a decline in real wages.  
We in the NDP believe that two key issues need to be addressed. 
The picture is very grim. 
What did we have yesterday? 
This is how the government sees education now. 
Does this sound like we are talking about post-secondary education? 
The second part of a comprehensive strategy is a youth employment strategy. 
Unfortunately these programs do not exist. 
What should be done? 
We provide first jobs to graduates in science and technology.  
In conclusion I say that this is a very good motion. 
It deserves our support. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have about three minutes remaining in the debate. 
The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis has three minutes.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
I heard his diatribe. 
I do not know how long he spoke. 
It scares business away.  
It scares business away like nothing else. 
It is: ``Let us have another referendum''. 
If it rained it was federal rain. 
If it was cloudy it was a federal cloud. 
Anything that happened was federal. 
If one was sick it was due to the federal government. 
If people were not employed it was due to the federal government. 
I am sick and tired of this diatribe. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
The Liberal member obviously thinks that everything they are doing is absolutely perfect. 
There are a lot of good programs. 
We believe a review should be done. 
Some of the programs are excellent. 
We do not know what is the success rate of all the other programs. 
Is it 10% or $200 million? 
Is it 30% or $600 million? 
When it comes to the labour force basically there are three groups in Canada. 
Another group of young Canadians are those who are working outside the country. 
Why are they working outside the country? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Obviously a memory lapse seems to have happened on the cabinet side.  
I want to quote some editorial sections. 
They are very true. 
It does not make any sense, but that is what it is doing.  
Volvo states that it is going to build buses in Mexico. 
It just purchased a bus plant. 
What happens to the 1,400 workers in Quebec? 
It says anybody who criticises this measly severance will be terminated from the severance package. 
They will have no access at all. 
What kind of a democracy do we live in?  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The federal government is acutely aware of the importance of this plant to Halifax. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.37 p.m.)
