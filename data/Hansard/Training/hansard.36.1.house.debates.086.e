Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McLelland):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Deputy Speaker (Mr. McLelland):
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1997 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
There are a number of things wrong with this bill. 
We are told that health is a priority. 
And the federal government remains indifferent to what the provinces are going through.  
That is how absurd the system has become... 
Lacking vision, Ottawa is investing in visibility.  
I would also like to share another concern regarding Bill C-28. 
There is an apparent conflict of interest. 
As yet our request has remained unanswered.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
It is important to talk about these issues.  
She was coming here to Ottawa for an eye operation. 
They are short-staffed. 
Their employees are totally exhausted. 
It is important that this be pointed out.  
Transfers were cut drastically and people have to be reminded of that. 
That is the truth. 
That is the only thing they did.  
How many people will not get their first $100 back and will still get cancer? 
The number of beds is down, but people still get sick. 
In the Moncton area, right now, 300 nurses work only part time. 
This is a problem. 
We should be realistic about this situation. 
First of all, people deserve a little bit of security. 
It has simply cancelled cuts that were supposed to be made. 
This is the important thing to remember. 
The government has been cutting right and left for a long time.  
How many of us could live on just $5.75 an hour? 
Not many, I think. 
And yet this is what we expect the poor in Canada to live on.  
These are jobs our children might have had eventually. 
They are also services that are no longer available to the public. 
That is what we see.  
This is the sort of thing we have to deal with.  
It is no different in education. 
There is a problem here, too. Sure, our young people can borrow. 
It is sad, but that is what is happening.  
It is not very useful indeed. 
It certainly made its share of cuts.  
Social assistance is a serious problem in our region. 
Those who do not have jobs live on welfare. 
There is money in this country. 
It is not true that there is no money. 
And the middle class is paying for both. 
The middle class is beginning to disappear. 
The middle class and the small and medium size business sector are constantly under attack. 
The ACOA, for instance, will lose one third of its funding. 
We are beginning to wonder. 
Will the government totally abandon Atlantic Canada?  
Do you want to see what high unemployment is? 
Then you will see what high unemployment is all about.  
What is not being done right? 
What have we done wrong? 
What needs to be done?''  
There is no such program. 
That is not how it is done. 
Because they cannot draw employment insurance. 
This is a great pity. 
In fact things are getting worse. 
There are people who had jobs but lost them. 
Money is no longer circulating. 
It is a problem 
It is not true that the economy is so wonderful. 
Our SMBs are trying, however. 
We are trying to develop them, but we need help. 
These are not privileges, although it is starting to look like it. 
Once again, I think it is a lack of planning. 
That is not what happens.  
There would go to these employment centres in search of a job. 
It is not the case at the moment. 
We must endeavour to put these people back to work.  
We must also be realistic. 
It is sad to see the situation young people are in. 
There is no planning. 
We need long term planning. 
There is potential in our region, hard working people. 
Professionals are supposed to be working to help these people. 
Who is listening when we say we need these programs? 
The government is cutting on both ends.  
The same thing is happening in the fisheries. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
We are putting food on your table.''  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Does this mean the planning should be up to the provinces? 
No one wants to listen.  
Look what that does. 
That is a problem and it is one at every level.  
That is what the expression bottom up suggests. 
Does it mean that the province will be in charge of managing the money? 
Will the Kent economic commission manage the whole thing? 
Someone has to do it, but first we need to have programs.  
We talk about prevention. 
People get depressed in winter when they are out of work. 
They always look forward to spring when they can resume working.  
He would help the unemployed. 
That is what he said.  
We are the ones who elected him. 
But even worse, we believed him.  
That era is over. 
The people back home will not put up with this any longer.  
I think it is time for the Liberals to start thinking about this. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I know colleagues would agree with that.  
We know that our taxes are far too high. 
Let me speak specifically to some of these concerns. 
It is an unbelievable amount of money. 
It is a staggering amount. 
That is about 70% of the gross domestic product. 
It is one of the worst levels of debt in the world. 
It is a huge problem.  
However they will be saddled with the debt. 
Some of the currencies saw a devaluation in the order of 55%, a tremendous devaluation. 
There are tremendous economic problems in Asia.  
That is a direct impact of high levels of debt on ordinary Canadians. 
Therefore we oppose the bill for that reason.  
Sadly Bill C-28 does not do that.  
I accept that because I think it is correct. 
I do not think he would do that on purpose.  
I want to set that whole argument aside for a moment. 
He is not alone in doing this. 
Many other companies do this.  
It raises some questions. 
We have staggering levels of taxation.  
All it did was slow down the rate of growth in taxes. 
We will see those premiums rise by 73%.  
With that measure alone Canadians are worse off.  
What does this do to the ordinary Canadian? 
I want to relate a story. 
One almost has to be dead to take advantage of that credit. 
It is virtually impossible to get. 
It is not something the rest of us can do.  
It does not just end with people like Lawrence Weston. 
Many other people are in exactly the same position. 
It is the same sort of situation. 
We receive mail all the time. 
Let us consider for a moment some of the businesses out there. 
They do not want to pay taxes. 
People take advantage of loopholes in the tax system all the time. 
Mr. Monte Solberg: ``I wonder why'', says my friend in the back. 
It is not a mystery to me. 
First, we start the process of priorizing our spending. 
We do not waste those precious dollars given to us by taxpayers. 
We dedicate that money to the things that are important to Canadians.  
I can say with all honesty what people in my riding say. 
The government has failed to do that. 
I guess we should be thankful for that.  
We do not believe in taking the shotgun approach. 
We think we should have lower taxes. 
We advocate sweeping tax relief. 
They would not have to pay income tax anymore. 
I think that is the correct approach.  
We believe there must be a program for debt repayment. 
The government has no program. 
We need a plan. 
We do have a plan. 
We have an approach to dealing with this situation.  
We say leave that money in the hands of taxpayers. 
They will do a far better job than politicians and bureaucrats.  
Where has he been during the whole debate we had on the budget? 
Is that not how we dealt with the deficit? 
Why does he feel we have not addressed that issue?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not remember making reference to a member's name.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will go on to questions and comments.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
This is from a young man who is going to be faced with taxes. 
I thought this was unique.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
It is something I failed to touch on during my speech.  
We have seen debt levels go ever upward in the last several years. 
That is the real fiscal dividend.  
So we have to do something about that side of it. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the hon. member for Crowfoot.  
We need $4 billion to help out all those people who have been victimized. 
That is the approach that will help all Canadians.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
At times it appears that the government has the delusion of adequacy. 
What we know for certain is that this is a government without a vision.  
Canada needs a comprehensive national tax relief plan today. 
The NAFTA remains an integral tool for economic growth. 
It deprives Canadian industries of the ability to remain competitive. 
There are four targeted education components to Bill C-28. 
As with tax relief, specific targeting will not be the answer. 
Instead we must begin backing this up with our actions.  
It is very simple. 
Where is that engineer? 
Why did he do that? 
Because he pays no taxes or very little taxes.  
That day is not here. 
What had to happen happened. 
As we know, the committee is under Liberal control. 
This tactic helped me understand a lot of things. 
Do they have anything to hide? 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Let me be very clear. 
This bill is typical of a Liberal-Tory approach to fiscal policy. 
This bill offers no tax relief to cash strapped Canadians.  
That is a crying shame.  
They are barely making ends meet.  
This bill does nothing to help him, nothing whatsoever. 
This government has failed to live up to its responsibility to those people.  
It is almost $1,600 back into his pocket. 
Some of these social costs are nothing but staggering. 
The total interest-bearing debt sits at around $600 billion. 
It could definitely have an effect here.  
Are we prepared with the massive debt and the interest payments? 
We have to go outside to borrow the money. 
Why should we as an industrialized country be in that position? 
It would be nice to be independent but unfortunately that is not the case.  
That is one point dealing with the debt. 
Debt interest is $45 billion. 
Reform has a much better plan. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
I represent the riding of Levis, where we have a big shipyard.  
This is very important. 
The matter is closed''. 
We do no think it is that simple. 
That is too easy a way out. 
We are dealing with companies operating in international shipping. 
Canada Steamship Lines is one of these companies. 
Ships do travel, just like planes do. 
This is a very important issue, and the people have a right to know.  
I would like to touch on another aspect. 
His response was always that he had business interests in shipping. 
So, he does admit to having interests, but argues that they are held in trust.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Because of all this the federal debt is nearly 70% of GDP.  
Obviously we cannot because people have to live.  
Of the developed nations our income tax burden is the highest. 
I have several questions: 
This bill does absolutely nothing to address that kind of situation.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
And we are not the only ones to express criticism. 
The Senate is also addressing this issue. 
We are still waiting for an answer.  
And this is unacceptable.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
There are other aspects of the CHST that I will get into in a moment.  
Note the words, ``It survives despite them. 
That is where we are coming from on this.  
There is also a social deficit in this country. 
Gender is a critical demographic factor in the poverty story of this country.  
In addition to gender, marital status is a key factor. 
We know as well what has happened there. 
One in five children now live in low income families. 
Still other demographic factors are linked to poverty. 
Aboriginal Canadians are significantly more likely to be poor than the rest of the population. 
In conclusion, this caucus is opposed to Bill C-28. 
The provinces are struggling to provide social services. 
Therefore, this caucus will be opposing Bill C-28.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
There are more than 400 clauses in Bill C-28. 
It is complex, and multi-facetted. 
All opposition parties unanimously requested that the government shed light on the matter. 
Through their MPs, citizens also are involved. 
Payments were drastically cut back. 
The cuts are not over yet, they are ongoing. 
They are not eligible for social assistance. 
Several families have nothing to live on until work starts again. 
This spring gap has its origin in the 1994 reform.  
The finance minister needs to be above all suspicion. 
It is hard to understand.  
He has been hard on the unemployed. 
Bill C-28 will remain a sad episode. 
I would not be carrying out my responsibilities if I did not speak out. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Everyone pays them, or at least everyone should. 
Bill C-28 is a complex bill. 
It contains hundreds of clauses. 
It affects all sorts of provisions. 
Between you and me, we are not going to pull any punches.  
He did not sell the shares to buy a bus company. 
It may be ludicrous, but it is legal.  
I should hope so. 
We should not expect anything less.  
But the real code of ethics does not say that. 
Why does he not give us all the facts? 
Why does he hide behind the Prime Minister? 
Why does he not give all the information to the House and the media?  
We have a problem. 
But this was all put in the same package. 
The Liberals put in the whole cake something that looks like a rotten fruit. 
Do they think I will eat this cake? 
Do they think that the Bloc Quebecois will eat this cake?  
Perhaps he has a good explanation. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
This is an apparent conflict of interest.  
Surveys show that members of Parliament are not well perceived by the public. 
After seeing such ways of doing things, it is easy to understand why.  
The finance minister says he is innocent of any intention. 
In 1998, the minister came back and sponsored Bill C-28. 
How could he not be aware, as he would have us believe? 
How can a minister introduce a bill without knowing its content?  
This is a warning to the government. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
The bill is sponsored by the Minister of Finance himself. 
The Prime Minister tells us: ``I have complete confidence in my Minister of Finance. 
In order to avoid what? 
The minister used a strategy that has been denounced by the auditor general. 
He must allocate to each year the amount of expenditures that occur in that year''. 
The Minister of Finance did not do so. 
He cannot be trusted.  
What did the minister do? 
The third example is the millennium fund. 
The Minister of Finance recorded this amount in the budget for fiscal year 1997-98. 
He did not want to show a surplus, just a zero deficit. 
What did the Bloc Quebecois do? 
Can we believe him? 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
If interest rates go down, the finance minister will probably win. 
It is was the Secretary of State for Financial Institutions. 
Business decisions are made on much more. 
It is being presented in a way which questions the integrity of the finance minister. 
The members even suggested that it was contrary to the code of ethics. 
That is not so. 
He had checked it out.  
The opposition then decided to do even more work on it. 
There was really nothing to prove.  
They would be sued.  
The ethics commissioner has made a detailed ruling with regard to this matter. 
It did not do it in a meanspirited way. 
The commitment of the government to be fiscally responsible continues. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The vote is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the division bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):

Is the House in agreement?

And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
When shall the bill be read a third time? 
It will now be easier to amend the limits in the international convention.  
Canadian contributions to the international fund are paid from the ship source oil pollution fund.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The number of substandard ships plying the seas is mind boggling. 
The latter of course are disasters waiting to happen.  
Bill S-4 accomplishes this. 
Their rates are already proportionately high. 
All in all, Bill S-4 is useful legislation. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
The proposed legislation sets specific limits.  
This bill, without wishing to detract from it, is only now becoming law. 
There is another thing that should not be forgotten. 
We all like to watch ships go by. 
Even though it is held in trust, I cannot talk about it''. 
I have been speaking on this subject for five years. 
But let us not forget that the vast majority of these ships are not Canadian.  
I will quote more figures. 
It would also allow us to reduce accident risks by 610%.  
Here are some telling figures. 
The difference is huge.  
I invite all my colleagues to do so. 
I also invite them to listen to what their constituents have to say. 
We will resume debate after question period. 
The member for Cumberland-Colchester will have the floor.  
It being 2 p.m., the House will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
This year our riding celebrates the 34th annual maple syrup festival. 
All residents of Waterloo-Wellington thank them for their dedication.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
They do not get the money. 
There is nothing left for ordinary band members.  
What happens when one of them points this out? 
They get hassled and threatened. 
What happens if they write a letter to the minister? 
Their letter is sent to their hasslers. 
They are ignored and called names.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to your recipe.  
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
As Canadians we owe him our thanks. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
It would be appropriate for the House to act to end this national disaster. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
It was the least I could do.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the following are the words of Steven Harrison from my riding: 
I had my second transplant and all was well until October 1996. 
Last Friday the package was announced and what a disappointment. 
Like them I am sick and I am dying from my disease. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Now John prepares for an even greater journey. 
``Get ready Newfoundland, you are going to be first''.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Shame on the Liberals for repeatedly embracing what they repeatedly said they would not do.  
THE LATE MAXWELL COHEN 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
He was throughout his lifetime on the leading edge of legal change. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
This new Quebec policy is more positive, open and beneficial to the aboriginals. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
I am proud to say that the students displaying such drive are Newfoundlanders.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The fight must go on. 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Once again Huron-Bruce manages to score the winning goal.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the government needs transplant surgery. 
The Liberal government is chronically ill. 
First, there is the regular system that is sick and failing us. 
We do not have a health system in Canada. 
We have a sickness system. 
SOCIETE SAINT-JEAN BAPTISTE 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Today it is starting to unravel. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Other premiers and provincial governments will likely follow.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, all governments had many occasions to discuss this. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Here is another: ``When people are sick, you don't discriminate''. 
And this one: ``We'll have to try to find a way. 
Who said these things? 
The Prime Minister's backbenchers.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have had discussions on this. 
Everybody does not always agree with me every time. 
I wish they would, but that is not always the case. 
We have had discussions and we have a responsibility. 
We are meeting our responsibilities. 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is about negligence and responsibility. 
In fact, the Liberals demanded that compensation for all of them. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We completed what was started 10 years ago.  
Same principle then, same principle now. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is nonsense. 
That compensation was fair and we agree with that. 
We were glad that the government finally came through with that.  
The minister talks about setting the record the straight. 
They know there are problems in its own backbenches. 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again let me set the record straight.  
Allow me to quote: 
I feel that our program is justified and that we made a fair decision.  
Minister Rochon said again that he was in favour.  
This morning Mr. Clark said- 
The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are still in discussions with the British with respect to this matter. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
What are the government's priorities? 
Instead of investing in people, it is investing in armaments. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Protection of that sovereignty is part and parcel of that. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is very clear that the provinces support this offer.  
He put the same thing in writing in a letter to all health ministers.  
This morning Premier Clark said what we all feel. 
His minister's office confirmed it supports it.  
Let us keep the facts clear. 
All provincial governments joined with the federal government in supporting this position.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at the facts today. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member misses the point. 
That is a position shared by all governments. 
All of us believe it is the right thing to do.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
It cannot be justified by an Canadian. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We cannot have two standards.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
All provincial ministers support the agreement.  
The member talks about doing the right thing by the people. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
We accept those conclusions in their entirety and without reservation''.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I quoted the Prime Minister's website. 
Which one of these individuals over here is the frequent flyer without the f ?  
I am not sure that was a question. 
If the hon. minister wishes to address himself to the statement he may do so. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I know he recommended that everybody be compensated.  
That is the position. 
That is our conclusion. 
That is the position of all the governments in Canada.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The heritage minister is of the opinion that Option Canada's case is closed.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
She has provided over 100 pages of documentation. 
They simply do not want to accept the reality. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
We could not read any of them.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Maybe she should ask the PQ government. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
They are not infected with them by the health system. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It has been the subject of public debate from time to time.  
To take another approach- 
The hon. member for Wanuskewin.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Were they better off before?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There is a risk-benefit ratio in every medical procedure.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We saw what happened during the 1989-1992 recession.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I want the member to bear that in mind.  
That is not what is in place at the moment. 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
It was the Minister of Health in the Ottawa Citizen on November 23, 1997.  
Why did this health minister abandon his own principles?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
By so doing we spared those 22,000 people the ordeal of continuous litigation.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Even Liberal Party members called for one at their recent convention.  
Why is the government not taking action in the area of shipbuilding?  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to answer the question. 
This government has always had a shipbuilding policy. 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The current heritage minister called it a national tragedy back then. 
That was when the Liberals were in opposition. 
That was when they had principles.  
I have a question for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not an answer. 
What we are getting is just more and more of this kind of stonewalling. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the question of principle is clear. 
However, we are still willing to offer a compensation package of $1.3 billion. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for the question.  
A committee is in place. 
Come next year all the evidence will be in. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It was a question of methodology. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I think she had it right. 
But it may be mythology.  
They refused at that time to sign an affidavit which would justify those figures.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the RCMP has been very clear. 
It was a question of methodology. 
The problems have been resolved. 
It has been established by the RCMP that they have been resolved. 
The RCMP is satisfied.  
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Minister. 
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
He still has not got an answer. 
The hon. government House leader.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Why is he not raising those kinds of issues? 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are looking into the matter even as we speak.  
ATLANTIC CANADA OPPORTUNITIES AGENCY 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her positive question on ACOA.  
These programs have a beginning and they have an end. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
That is why we will be undertaking an exhaustive review. 
We want to complete it by the end of the year. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
I am going to hear this question. 
The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.  
They all know what is wrong. 
Only the Prime Minister insists on doing what is wrong.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
On a personal statement the hon. leader of the Progressive Conservative Party.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that I have changed my mind.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
I have never seen so many faces change so rapidly.  
This resignation is to take effect on April 3. 
I held the position of Minister of the Environment for over two years. 
I will be leaving the House of Commons for a new political arena.  
During my years in federal politics I was a participant in two great events. 
The first was one of the greatest victories in Canadian political history. 
The other was one of the greatest defeats in Canadian political history. 
We also implemented several literacy initiatives.  
All these prime ministers are, without exception, exceptional individuals. 
Canada's influence on the world stage was significant. 
I leave behind all those who work in the House of Commons. 
Today I want to spill the best kept secret in the country. 
I especially want to thank the fantastic team in my Sherbrooke office. 
I want to thank all these people who have served me so well.  
Today Quebec is profoundly divided, therefore in a weakened state.  
It is to go back to these people- 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
It is in that spirit that I am embarking on this new journey.  
I want to thank them.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Then he became deputy prime minister. 
He took the reins of his party under very difficult circumstances.  
The last four years must have been very difficult for the leader. 
He has done very well. 
I know he will carry on making a great contribution to this country.  
Democracy came to Canada a long time ago. 
We are one of the first democracies where responsible governments were established. 
We have managed to build a country that is an example to the world.  
I hear a baby in the gallery. 
He is applauding you already. 
He or she is in the Liberal gallery.  
He was an excellent member of Parliament and he worked very hard at it.  
The whole country congratulates him for the initiative he has undertaken. 
We wish him good luck. 
Long live Quebec and long live Canada.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
To the hon. member for Sherbrooke, I say thank you, goodbye and good luck.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Farewell to the hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to return to the federalist tone.  
I wish him well more as a federalist than as a Liberal.  
He responded to the call. 
He responded to the duty that he saw was his in this historical moment. 
We congratulate him for that.  
We all need to do this together. 
We need to work together.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Over the years, we developed a true friendship. 
His political career is impressive. 
He knows Canada and Canadians very well. 
During the referendum campaign, he called himself the keeper of change. 
He talked about a modern, strong and confident Quebec. 
People were drawn to his message and to his genuineness.  
Last week he told me ``I am choosing Quebec''. 
In choosing their premier, Quebeckers make an important decision. 
They place their trust in someone who will defend their interests.  
We know Quebec is profoundly divided and weakened. 
I believe in this sort of partnership. 
I believe in your ability to bring people together.  
I would especially like to thank the voters of the riding of Sherbrooke. 
We thank you and your family. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Consequently, I would like to redesignate that debate for April 21.  
Thursday, April 23 shall be an allotted day.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully, too. 
I heard the same comment during question period. 
I do not think there is anything wrong with ``requent flyer.'' 
He just dropped the f . 
It is not a big deal.  
I will have a look at the blues.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Canadians elected 301 representatives last June. 
They are sitting in this Chamber, not in the Senate.  
The NDP believes that it is time to modernize the Canada Shipping Act. 
Bill S-4 will permit Canada's accession to it.  
Large corporations have to be more responsible. 
They have to be more accountable. 
It is our environment that has suffered and we must ensure its protection. 
We will be supporting the bill.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
We have water east, west and north. 
We have the Great Lakes and the seaway.  
The bill has been nurtured through the system for many years. 
We are really pleased to see it and we will be supporting the bill.  
In summary, we are pleased to support this legislation. 
It is long past overdue and very much needed in the maritime industry in Canada. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
The bill is long overdue. 
It will be welcomed across the country and throughout the world.  
It was ironic, however, when I was reading the very last of my notes. 
This is a little humour here. 
I know there are members who have paid that much of a fine for speeding. 
I thought that portion of the bill was a little lax. 
It could have been more. 
However, this is a good bill.  
He thanked the Standing Committee on Transport. 
I appreciated his remarks. 
We did have a good round of looking at the bill in committee. 
I spoke to the bill on second reading. 
Members in my party and other opposition members also disagree. 
This is not good practice. 
That may not seem like a very big thing to a lot of people. 
I picked up the papers the other day. 
This is a good bill. 
There is nothing wrong with the bill. 
We deem that incorrect. 
I am sure most members do. 
I am pleased that we are going to support this bill. 
We think it is a good bill.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE SUPERANNUATION ACT 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
When shall this bill be read the third time? 
With leave of the House, now? 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We need to pass this bill as soon as possible.  
In case of death, benefits are transferred to the victim's family.  
The order also acknowledges that the security of these people is always threatened.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I and my party certainly support Bill C-12. 
This year is the 125th anniversary. 
Today there has been a lot of talk about Quebec and the Northwest Territories. 
This was raised earlier.  
That is definitely a concern.  
We have seen this happen in countries that harbour those kinds of weapons. 
The government would be wise to look at this issue. 
The way it is worked out financially, there is a cost saving. 
That is the paramount issue. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
These countries are grateful to us. 
Diplomats and ministers are exchanging compliments. 
But what about those who go to these countries? 
Are we treating them fairly? 
This is where Bill C-12 comes in. 
It tries to address a certain unfairness in the distribution of employee benefits. 
This is the purpose of the bill. 
It is designed to remedy imbalances in the operation of the pension schemes. 
No one can refute that statement. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
It has been too long in coming.  
Long expected raises for servicemen and women have been put on hold. 
Half of the military installations across Canada have been closed. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The legislation in essence is long overdue.  
They will place themselves in harm's way because of warring factions. 
This is the ultimate in bravery in the fight against unruly forces.  
At the beginning of the 20th century there was no such thing as peacekeeping. 
That distinction remained almost 80 years later.  
This was around the clock coverage. 
The difference was clear. 
If there existed a state of war, 24 hour coverage was provided. 
However for anything less much stricter restrictions would apply.  
Various governments have issued more than two dozen such designations. 
This was a logical provision for the domestic RCMP service. 
This is the sole purpose behind Bill C-12. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
I intend to split my time with the member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
While doing so Canadian peacekeepers live in danger 24 hours a day.  
It is not fair and it is not equitable.  
The bill corrects that inequity. 
They are all volunteers and they all experience some level of risk. 
Their job is not an easy one. 
It is not without significant personal risk.  
The bill strives to do just that. 
It is good law. 
I am hoping this House will act quickly. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I will outline the importance of this bill to all Canadians.  
In Canada this distinction is clear. 
A work related incident occurs during a work shift. 
I know this to be true. 
This acknowledgement continues today.  
This is not so for the RCMP. 
This bill addresses this double standard.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
There are a number of important components to this park. 
This agreement signed in 1996 recognizes that and indeed it honours that agreement. 
It also provides for Inuvialuit wildlife harvesting activities. 
They will be able to maintain their traditional activities within the boundaries of the park.  
I am very proud of that.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
The bill itself is very technical. 
It outlines in precise geographical terms the boundaries of the new park. 
In fact in the Siglik dialect of Inuvialuktun, ``tuktut nogait'' means ``caribou calves''.  
Wildlife in region 15 is mainly comprised of summer migrants. 
The Darnley Bay anomaly borders the new park on its western side. 
The company should be commended for that. 
I will be interested to learn how the park will be managed. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
That is not million; that is billion. 
There is Riding Mountain National Park. 
The park derives revenue that is going into the overall park revenue.  
In my judgment that represents a serious problem.  
There has to be more focus on those areas where the revenue is derived.  
I have a concern in the downsizing that has occurred. 
We have to approach it very conscientiously and very seriously.  
Madam Speaker, how much time do I have left?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time has expired. 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Information collected for public purposes and paid for by the taxpayers belongs to the people. 
This bill makes good sense. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am indebted the hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington for his assistance.  
I am also pleased to have an opportunity to speak on Bill C-208. 
Canadians have had the benefit of the federal Access to Information Act since 1983. 
For this reason I support the general goal of Bill C-208. 
I do not, however, support the specifics of the bill.  
What is proposed in Bill C-208? 
We all agree to this. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Section 67 currently provides the following: 
However, this legitimate demand requires that the policy development process be accessible. 
Does the current act meet these expectations? 
According to the member for Brampton, who introduced this bill, the answer is no. 
I totally agree with the member. 
And I am not the only one who thinks so. 
In his 1995-96 report, he condemned the three following cases.  
Third, there was a similar case at Health Canada. 
The bill before the House does not seem to deal with that particular issue.  
Unfortunately, Bill C-286 makes no mention of this.  
It is therefore our party's duty to support it.  
It must therefore be made clear that this reform remains incomplete in many ways.  
Much more extensive amendments are in order, however. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will add a few points to this important debate. 
We are talking about the destruction of evidence of what government officials and bureaucrats do. 
Everything in the office was shredded. 
There is a bit of a misconception here. 
That I think is important.  
There are two points that I think are very important. 
Recently we had a talk with, for example, the Canadian Wheat Board. 
I would like to add another feature. 
In general I would like to speak in favour of the bill. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is there unanimous consent to call it 6.30 p.m.?  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
The parliamentary secretary refused to answer the question.  
As a result, rapists and other violent offenders are walking free.  
We have numerous examples to prove this fact. 
When questioned about these two cases, the justice minister provided her typical answer. 
She was satisfied to leave this and similar controversies to the courts.  
It is a perfectly fair comment. 
The hon. member may continue his remarks.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
I will be guided by the judgment of the Chair on this matter.  
Since the parliamentary secretary is present I repeat my question to the government. 
This is taking place in all appeal courts in the country.  
That is why we have courts of appeal.  
It is important for hon. members to keep matters in perspective. 
The evidence so far is clear. 
We do not make laws in this country for the exceptions. 
We make them in order to cover a wide range of offences.  
(The House adjourned at 6.08 p.m.)
