BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
It has been discussed between the leaders of all parties in the House: 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The document is tabled.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
As it stands right now the paper is simply tabled. 
At that time it would be dealt with 
Mr. Speaker, I would like clarification on that. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We may well be getting the cart before the horse. 
The document is merely tabled. 
There is no motion before the House. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will go to the introduction of government bills.  
YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
CANADA WATER EXPORT PROHIBITION ACT 
Water will be the defining issue of the coming century and the centuries beyond. 
The overwhelming desire of Canadians is to protect their water from export. 
The bill simply attempts to do this.  
ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT ACT 
NATIONAL DAY AGAINST IMPAIRED DRIVING ACT 
This bill should be know as Cindy's bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
WAR VETERANS ALLOWANCE ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
The bill will do just that.  
It will generate no great newspaper headlines. 
What does Bill C-61 do for veterans? 
More than 35,000 widows fall in this category.  
I urge all members of the House to lend their support to this bill. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Dedication to service came at a high cost to these brave Canadians and Newfoundlanders. 
The first service causality of the war was with the merchant navy. 
Canada's merchant navy was very small in the early days of the war. 
At that time it only consisted of 38 ocean-going vessels. 
A calm, clear night with a full moon was cause for insomnia. 
In 1942 the German U-boat fleet grew from 91 to 212. 
This made the situation for the merchant ships deteriorate further. 
1942 was the year the ongoing battle of the Atlantic continued in earnest. 
German U-boats were infesting Canada's waters. 
Several ships were lost in the St. Lawrence River. 
As the war went on the Canadian contribution became so much more important. 
This truly was a war of material supply. 
All of this material was transported by our merchant navy.  
Some were lakers recruited for war on the high seas. 
The same could be said for their crews.  
Just as there was no typical ship, there was no typical seaman. 
Many had families, children and grandchildren.  
Of the 1,500 who died, eight of them were women.  
They still ferried supplies required for the rebuilding and restocking of Europe.  
If a ship was lost, on average, only 50% of the crew survived.  
Many dedicated individuals have worked to have the merchant navy's concerns addressed. 
Their work will be remembered as part of the lengthy battle for equality.  
I am pleased we can have this legislation passed without unreasonable delay.  
Recompense is the final concern which begs for settlement.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
The bill meets the concerns of a number of associations. 
Why is the government denying today what it wanted yesterday? 
I have personal knowledge of this. 
It was the fall of 1991. 
Their demands are slowly being met. 
However, the average age of these veterans is 75.  
They have been deprived of 50 years of benefits. 
They have suffered all their lives because of this refusal.  
Yet they too were in the line of fire. 
The merchant seamen were exposed to dreadful working conditions and heavy loss of life. 
However, he is untouched by their great suffering, especially their mental suffering.  
Only the Liberal government remains intractable.  
In addition to social benefits and disability pensions, they need a compensation package. 
Does the government have the necessary money?  
A total of $887,960,424 was not spent. 
Merchant navy seamen are asking for approximately $40 million.  
This bill could have restored this unspent money. 
And I could go on and on. 
I was also there. 
The merchant seamen showed no bitterness. 
Why are they still being refused what they are entitled to, 50 years later?  
They make it look good. 
The people of Europe and Asia, who lived through it, already do remember.  
Most of the time, a handful of local people attend. 
Why not establish a real national day of remembrance in Canada? 
It is Canadians we should be informing and involving. 
Having a real day of respect, of thanks and of commemoration. 
In committee, I introduced an amendment that was ruled out of order. 
However, included in the bill, it would have resolved the problem once and for all. 
It read as follows: 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
These brave Canadians played a central role in Canada's war efforts. 
What happened to the Canadian merchant mariners upon their return to Canada? 
This payment was promised last December. 
It strikes me as at least an effort to achieve a just settlement.  
What about Canada's aboriginal veterans? 
Our Liberal government has failed miserably where so many other governments have succeeded. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I will never forget the day. 
I was only a little girl, about seven years old. 
We are going to the train station for the boys are coming home''.  
The veterans are very dear to my heart. 
How would you feel? 
You would feel hurt. 
You would feel let down. 
Some of those men come into my office with tears in their eyes. 
Their wives, as well, get in touch with me. 
It has been 54 years that they have been fighting for equality.  
I believe the answer we would hear from most Canadians is yes.  
Why would people feel this way? 
People today are well informed. 
They know these veterans were not really paid a high premium for their service. 
It shows when they were in the water and it shows them dying. 
One of eight merchant navy men was lost at sea.  
I am pleased and proud that we gave these to them.  
What was offered to merchant navy men? 
They were kept busy cleaning up the seaways.  
Think of how old these men are today. 
They cannot go out and shovel. 
They cannot do the cleaning that has to be done. 
They cannot do the cleaning within the home. 
They need that part time service. 
We do not want them to be totally independent.  
I am proud to be a Canadian. 
I do not think anyone would question that. 
However, there is hope.  
I want to make it perfectly clear. 
Is that not a big lump sum payment? 
I think the maximum was perhaps $30,000, although for very few of them.  
There may be around 2,000 still living today.  
The money is there. 
We can give these men back their dignity. 
I know many of my colleagues on the government side agree with me. 
He sat down with them. 
That is what we need, that kind of dialogue to get the understanding we need. 
I thank him very much today.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The achievements of CMHC have benefited the country. 
Many of our own families and communities have been helped. 
The funds provide help to repair unhealthy and unsafe homes. 
The benefits of the bill are threefold. 
Third, CMHC will be able to provide better service to all Canadians.  
Thirty housing industry representatives joined him on that mission. 
The members for the ridings of Kelowna and Quebec also participated in the trade mission. 
Earlier I mentioned that these amendments reflect our government's priorities. 
This is demonstrated in several ways. 
However we want to do more. 
Millions of Canadian families bought their first home thanks to the insurance program. 
In fact, one in three Canadian homebuyers have been helped by CMHC in this way. 
As such, it has introduced government to a new way of delivering services. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
There a consequential amendment to another act.  
What are the financial costs? 
What are the economic costs? 
What about the quality of life?  
These are the questions I wish to address. 
Is that not an interesting way of saying we are getting out of the business? 
The government did not consult with the provinces. 
I will have more to say on that later. 
Where is CMHC right now? 
I would like to go into some details as well. 
They too come from the corporate plan. 
With regard to mortgage loan insurance it stated: 
It is a wonderful program. 
That is what it is doing. 
It could not go beyond the $150 billion.  
In other words it was increased to $200 billion. 
It is very interesting that the bill does not change that. 
This is an interesting development. 
The corporation is running the show. 
This decline in 1997 is attributed to an increase in claim expenses. 
In 1996 it had a profit. 
This applies to new commercial mortgage insurance business initiated after 1996.  
What is beginning to develop with CMHC is very interesting. 
It is no longer simply a crown corporation. 
Legally it is, but it is entering into direct competition with the financial institutions. 
I will explain that a little later. 
That is one area.  
CMHC is also involved in mortgage backed securities.  
Let us go into other areas. 
Canada Mortgage and Housing gets into assisted housing.  
In fact it is just under $2 billion. 
This is very interesting. 
This theme will develop as we go along here. 
What is happening here is significant.  
CMHC today is also involved internationally. 
I was one of the participants in that trade venture. 
It was a good one. 
I commend the way in which it was conducted. 
Some good things are happening in that area.  
That is a different issue altogether. 
There are other initiatives.  
The corporate account is another area.  
That is what it is now.  
By 1938 the act had helped finance almost 5,000 housing units.  
That was the beginning. 
That is why it was created.  
Why would the financial institution not increase the amount of money available?  
It is very short. 
In 1946 the federal government established the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
There is also a historic federal and provincial partnership here. 
The minister announced that the program was to come to an end. 
The lead responsibility for delivering the programs was in most cases given to the provinces. 
That is really the issue here. 
They were given the lead. 
Also, they are extremely capable of doing that.  
It has to do with co-op housing.  
It wanted to download this. 
Lo and behold, enough pressure was created that the minister changed his mind. 
He said that federal co-op housing would stay where it is.  
There are two kinds of co-op housing. 
One I really like is equity co-op housing. 
We all want this.  
It is about a 50:50 split.  
An Action Plan for Toronto''.  
They talk about specific strategies for high risk subgroups, families with children.  
There has been a dramatic increase. 
Some of these shelters are being populated to a large degree now by families. 
What about the health component in all this?  
There are some 110 recommendations that follow this report.  
We have to come to grips with this. 
One government can do this. 
As we go into this corporate plan it is interesting to note what CMHC says. 
In the 1998-2002 plan CMHC says it: 
How many different ways do we have to look at the same problem? 
One would almost think the city of Toronto was doing this in isolation. 
This task force received assistance from all kinds of experts. 
Did it get it only from Toronto? 
They received assistance from Canadian cities like Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver and Winnipeg. 
This task force is not made up of amateurs. 
These are not people who do not care about policy. 
Now CMHC says it will conduct a forum. 
We have the information we need. 
It knows all about this.  
There was a time when this was significant, in 1935. 
The involvement of multiple levels of government creates basic inefficiency. 
It creates mutual recriminations. 
We do not need that. 
It could be simplified so easily. 
There are immediate expedient types of solutions presented. 
Let us do that. 
This act does not come to grips with those kinds of things. 
It simply moves along and makes what is into law. 
I believe the CMHC has lost its way in another area. 
It goes on to say: 
These are the key tactics: 
CMHC plan improvements to its mortgage insurance product line. 
The Corporation will pursue CMHC-led multi-lender MBS pools in 1998. 
An annual payment to the government is currently being developed.  
That is exactly what this law does. 
It is simply getting into direct competition.  
I think that is wrong in principle. 
I do not think it is fair at all.  
What does a reverse equity mortgage mean? 
Maybe that market will grow. 
That is another issue. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I apologize for interrupting the hon. member. 
The party I represent in the House admits this. 
It did not spring up out of thin air. 
CMHC was not created with money that came out of thin air. 
Much has changed since this troublemaker has been on the scene. 
This troublemaker comes out unscathed.  
We may well raise questions. 
We are not at fault. 
Quebec was never there.  
This is happening in several areas. 
The spirit of Bill C-66 is a first reflection of this. 
This is why it created its own housing corporation. 
A new policy is taking shape and, as always, this government is inconsistent.  
This has happened in my riding. 
This is not the first such case I have seen; it happens frequently. 
We have learned to live with that.  
They are meddling in an area that is not theirs. 
As a Bloc Quebecois member, I cannot allow that. 
Once again the government is treading on provincial jurisdiction. 
Government spending has not significantly decreased in the past five years. 
We are not fooled. 
I find no interest at all in this bill.  
The CMHC lends the rest of the money.  
This does not make much sense. 
It is not the government that loses. 
I will end on that note. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
That having been said, we would have liked to support this bill. 
Because we are all positive people. 
I think that is known. 
But there is a problem. 
I would like someone to explain this to me in the course of this debate.  
There are two problematical clauses. 
So I asked him directly, and his reply was ``Yes, that is a possibility''. 
It reads, and I quote: 
I will come back to this.  
I see that Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is nodding. 
That is good news. 
We have long awaited that. 
However, the amounts involved are totally ridiculous. 
This means that 81.3% of federal spending on housing takes place outside Quebec. 
Yet 18.17% of federal spending on housing is all we get.  
All governments have decried this trend. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member is seeking leave of the House to table a document. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Madam Speaker, I think members will be the richer for it. 
Please pass it out on that side.  
I have the breakdown here. 
It makes perfect sense. 
However, Quebec does not want to incur losses. 
It is a lot of money. 
I think this cannot be avoided. 
Housing initiatives must be linked to land management, income security and the fight against poverty.  
The Quebec government, of course. 
It is closer to the people. 
I know this is an issue of great concern to him. 
What is low income housing about? 
It sends a conflicting message.  
It is our hope that this will be included in the bill.  
I ask government members to look at clause 88(2). 
If this condition were met, we could support the bill.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
If I were to summarize this bill in one word it would be destructive. 
Owning their own homes was a dream many thought was unachievable. 
On the surface Bill C-66 appears harmless. 
To use an old saying, the devil is in the details. 
They pave the way for the privatization of social housing in Canada.  
These are currently minimum requirements for social housing units. 
Now we come to the real reason for these changes. 
I wish to give accolades to my colleague from Churchill, the critic for this area. 
Why did the Liberal Party change its mind on many other issues? 
Meanwhile, a perfectly good home was left abandoned. 
This is the history of our country. 
Cities like Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax are in a crisis state. 
It only makes sense. 
The government has abandoned the great principles of former Prime Minister Lester Pearson. 
It has abandoned the principles of Warren Allmand. 
That is exactly what they have done.  
My hon. colleague is absolutely right. 
I would also like to discuss the changes to the structure of CMHC's board.  
For many home buyers this takes the form of mortgage insurance.  
It is exactly the opposite.  
Instead it froze and then decreased funding for co-ops. 
I guess he has missed that target.  
So much for the word of the finance minister.  
The Golden report suggests that CMHC get into direct mortgage lending. 
Today there is $1.9 billion going toward social housing. 
That was done under the previous Conservative government. 
The NDP was never in power.  
Today we have 4,000 more homes, but less money. 
This followed discussions with interest groups in meetings across Canada. 
I was listening to the national news last night. 
I am not saying they do not have any problems, but problems can be fixed. 
They should see the condition of some of those houses. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend my hon. colleague for his excellent speech on this bill.  
He is a great colleague and a next door neighbour to my riding.  
Coincidentally, the mayor of Toronto was here yesterday for a meeting with the Prime Minister. 
They are from everywhere. 
I do not know how the principals and the staff cope. 
I do not know how the children cope. 
Similarly with food banks, there is an endless lineup at food banks.  
I am extremely proud of my community because we have coped magnificently. 
They provide meals on a weekly basis, whether it is a breakfast or a dinner. 
However, we are starting to have compassion fatigue. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
The Canada Cord Ceremony was recently held for Pathfinders who achieved this award in 1998. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this week is National Farm Safety Week. 
Its efforts in this and other fields must be appreciated and acknowledged.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Those of us who know her best know her as more than a parliamentarian. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Luc Plamondon is arguably the most prolific lyricist in the French speaking world. 
Luc Plamondon believes in Quebec and in its artists. 
He has also been a champion of copyright.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
For that Canadians can thank Reform MPs from Surrey North and Crowfoot. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the best rehabilitative system for young people is strong families. 
Yes, they are getting on in years. 
The administration of the criminal justice system is left to the provinces in this country. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He paid a terrible price and he ran for parliament on those grounds.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not saying that Canadians do not understand. 
In fact, we have listened to Canadians. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
We prevent crime in the first place. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I recognize the hon. member for Quebec's interest in this issue. 
``Why pay taxes in Canada when taxes are so exorbitant?'' 
That is his own family.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is what we have done.  
Too bad his good sense did not rub off on the finance minister.  
In this case, obviously, there was violence because people were not obeying the law. 
For security reasons, he was hired under standard government guidelines.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
She is experiencing extreme medical, psychological and financial hardship. 
Why does the government not get its priorities straight?  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have our priorities straight. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
I know some people are asking if we will have early holidays. 
I regret to inform them we will not.  
Tomorrow we will debate the third reading of Bill C-55, the foreign publication bill. 
That debate will end tomorrow.  
We increase the pool. 
In my riding we have federal co-op houses. 
Of course it will not. 
There was no offer of funding for social housing. 
There was no offer of a national action plan for social housing. 
I think that Canadians understand intuitively that housing is a basic human need. 
There was even a Liberal member on the task force. 
Yes, there needs to be a partnership with the provinces. 
This is an important debate. 
Since 1993 no new co-operative housing units have been built. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
In addition, the member also knows about the RRAP, the additional funding for rehabilitation.  
Where is the commitment to meet this very important social need?  
It is fair to say that every Canadian needs to have adequate housing. 
Many people suffer today from a lack of adequate housing. 
With the right legislation, they probably could solve the majority of housing problems in Canada.  
Housing means many different things to many different people. 
What holds people back from finding suitable housing? 
It most often comes down to one factor: affordability, money, making ends meet.  
Every Canadian would be better served by having government reduce the tax burden. 
Surely even members of the government would agree with that.  
My hon. colleagues and I have raised a number of very pertinent questions. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
They would let them all go to Toronto.  
Those are not the same kinds of problems. 
I am not blaming the private sector. 
What we have is a ghettoization in the inner city of Winnipeg. 
I will talk more about the need in my riding of Winnipeg Centre. 
This was not because we needed housing since we all owned our own homes. 
You are allowed to have a duplex or transition, but a duplex at best. 
It is a basic right. 
It refuses to apply the urgent measures that are required to reverse this situation. 
It could be a 10 year old kid on pins and needles all the time. 
I know the value of the industry. 
That is not some kind of handout.  
That is not to say here is $2 million, build 40 units of social housing. 
Let us look at the purpose of the bill. 
Let us deal with housing financing. 
We see it every day on our way to work and on our way home. 
Paycheques are cut in less than half in this country.  
Clearly they are not doing it inside our borders. 
I can relate to how first time homebuyers are facing problems. 
They certainly have done a poor job in Canada.  
Why are infrastructure funds needed to build homes for seniors? 
When they do get a job they worry about paying taxes. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
We are offering a permanent solution.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
This has been proven time and time again. 
PROGRAM FOR OLDER WORKERS ADJUSTMENT 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The answer the minister gave me was not satisfactory. 
The work place is changing quickly. 
It is undergoing a mutation and requires new knowledge and skills. 
On its own, the labour market cannot remedy inequalities and injustices. 
The minister himself admits this in his book. 
The state must correct the inequities in the labour market.  
Employers hesitate to hire them because of their age. 
To get any retraining is a lengthy process. 
The doors to the workforce are not exactly wide open to them. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond on behalf of the minister. 
The government is committed to helping unemployed workers, including older workers. 
Therefore our efforts are being directed to helping those older workers who need our help.  
I thank the member for her question and for her concern. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 5.37 p.m.)
