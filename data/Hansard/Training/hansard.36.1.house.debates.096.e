GOVERNEMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
CANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Canadians value safety and security. 
Terrorism, including state sponsored terrorism, is an all too frequent occurrence. 
Several countries are active in trying to steal leading edge technology from Canada. 
CSIS has a mandate and a responsibility to investigate these matters.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the comments by the hon. Solicitor General of Canada.  
The greatest threat to any nation is always the problems within a nation. 
We must strengthen the RCMP and not continue to whittle away at its budget. 
We are under strengthed. 
We must reinforce that. 
I welcome the comments of the solicitor general. 
Let us see some action behind those words. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today in this debate.  
His story is dangerously like the preceding one. 
He made a formal complaint against CSIS last month.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I welcome the minister's statement on national security. 
It is an issue that requires national attention. 
I have raised these issues in the House on many occasions. 
There are allegations of infiltration and involvement in the ports.  
This is something that this country ought to take seriously. 
I welcome the initiative. 
On behalf of the New Democratic Party I welcome the initiative. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It is a very timely appearance by the solicitor general.  
They require concrete action.  
Canada continues to be open for business as far as organized crime is concerned.  
I would certainly hope that these measures do not have a long shelf life.  
I commend the solicitor general for identifying the priority area of CSIS. 
Sadly, this has not been the case.  
Certainly in Canada we have seen a rise in the area of organized crime. 
I recommend this bill to the House.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
It is signed by Ken Sharp and 300 people from the Peterborough area.  
These citizens note that there are 18,000 Canadians suffering from end-stage kidney disease. 
Mr. Speaker, I suggest all other questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is bordering on lunacy. 
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
I give him the floor.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
As justification, the federal government invoked the agreement signed with the provinces. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Tell that to those who are dying.  
Further, Standing Order 52(3) states: 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Today I did perhaps give a little extra time. 
I accept responsibility for that. 
The hon. government House leader is correct. 
I and other members are well aware of the regulation he is referring to.  
I received the letter earlier this morning. 
I read it and I gave it careful consideration. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This will provide focus and direction for the entire statute.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
There are some non-commercial ramifications, however, to the marine act. 
It is a disease. 
In any event, we can only maintain an attitude of watchful caution.  
Mr. Speaker, my sincere apologies to my hon. colleague. 
I do not see a quorum. 
I see a quorum. 
The hon. member may resume his remarks.  
These are some of the requirements for vessels up to six metres in length. 
And of course all canoes must now be equipped with tow lines. 
The people who wrote this little guide did have some compassion, though. 
It amazes me that they realize that.  
Do not let them run the Sea Doos through the swimmers. 
This is why we have local law enforcement. 
The dead hand of federal authority is hardly necessary.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
So, we are in favour of this bill being passed quickly. 
In the next few minutes, I would like to insist on a specific issue. 
Life preservers will be next.  
This would not be the first time the government has pulled such a sneaky trick.  
To conclude, our party will support this bill at third reading.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Currently there is no introductory part. 
However, my party has concerns with the bill. 
We cannot accept in Canada to lower the working conditions of sailors. 
Are we ready to accept such a system in Canada? 
We suffer from the cuts to airports. 
We suffer from the privatization of port police. 
Are we now going to have to suffer because ship safety goes down? 
We cannot put our safety or the environment in jeopardy.  
This section is contrary to the stated objectives of the new act. 
A figure of $12 million per annum has been stated. 
Their registration will be optional under section 17. 
It is important for the safety of our waterways.  
I am not suggesting that small pleasure craft need be inspected.  
Another area of concern is the regulation respecting the control of ballast water. 
To me that was a good thing. 
But there are still many areas of concern. 
As a result my party will not be supporting the bill.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
It was enacted in 1936. 
It is the primary legislation today for governing Canadian ships in Canada's jurisdiction.  
The government has chosen to carry out these reforms in a two step approach. 
The first step takes place with Bill C-15. 
This is something to consider and watch for in the future.  
Certificate of registry will now have an expiry date. 
We have to be very careful of that. 
It was a concern of the member for Cumberland-Colchester.  
We would encourage caution here.  
We are pleased with certain aspects of the bill. 
Clauses pertaining to definitions are important. 
Therefore we think it is a good thing.  
This legislation deals mostly with large vessels. 
We will be watching this matter with some concern as the future unfolds.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
COASTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
There aren't any.  
Up to this point the recipe is fine. 
We can see the approach. 
An independent committee is not something that works along party lines. 
But why go that route? 
This is where it gets interesting.  
I have a really big question in mind:
The same gang that is responsible for depletion of the stocks. 
That makes no sense whatsoever.  
They are being offered an opportunity to get that confidence back. 
I have another approach to suggest to the minister. 
The Constitution of Canada says that the federal government is responsible for fish catches. 
But what is he saving, the resource, or his people's jobs? 
This is where it gets a bit disconcerting.  
If the minister really wants to think about conservation, let him do so. 
When we refer to a fisheries plan, we mean one relating to conservation measures.  
Have the biologists not given their opinion? 
What is left in connection with conservation that needs to be studied? 
Is it not rather the economic questions that are not settled? 
That is another good question.  
But this has not been resolved yet.  
So I am making this suggestion. 
This is always of interest to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
But there are other species of fish. 
We should get consumers interested in these other species.  
These are things that must be considered.  
Everyone who finds that in their nets should bring it in''.  
I would like there to be discussion with the provinces. 
Changes are in order. 
We must address this whole problem.  
It is time he took action.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Canada will be in a position to ratify the agreement once this legislation is passed.  
Canada was one of the biggest cod exporters in the world. 
This represents a big loss for Canada. 
People's morale is at rock bottom. 
Their boats end up just rotting away where they are moored. 
No, especially not in a coastal region such as mine.  
We have known prosperity, but now we have fallen into poverty, deep poverty.  
Today, however, they have no more jobs. 
So, the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy was created. 
What will people do? 
Ask yourself that question. 
With no work and no income, the future looks bleak. 
Again, the government did not keep its promises. 
We are not asking the government to throw money at the problem. 
It cannot leave these people high and dry.  
We want to stay in the Atlantic region. 
We have no intention of moving because of anyone. 
That committee was made up of Liberals, Reformers, Conservatives and New Democrats. 
Today, the government is turning around and abandoning these people. 
They will not have any choice. 
Again today, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is dragging his feet.  
Today, he wonders why a member rises in the House and is frustrated.  
I am expressing the frustration of the Atlantic provinces. 
I am expressing the frustration of people from my region. 
They cannot survive on welfare. 
He could have announced the fishing plan last week. 
How far has the fishing plan got? 
What is the government's role with respect to the present state of the fishery? 
What has it done wrong? 
Since then, the FRCC is trying to fulfil its mandate through consultations. 
It should stop looking out for its own interests.  
The problems have not gone away. 
This is why the government should do its job. 
It should take our fish and create a secondary and tertiary processing industry. 
This is a truly important industry for our people. 
What does resource protection mean? 
At what price, and which country will pay that price? 
Let us stop for a minute and look at the fisheries situation. 
At the time, however, I was very hopeful. 
Today, we have understood-he had no trump cards. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is a very important issue we are talking about in the House today. 
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There does not appear to be a quorum in the House.  
There is no quorum. 
And the bells having rung: 
I see a quorum.  
So, I would like him to continue to inform the House about this.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
It is always nice to get praise in the House. 
I appreciate his comments.  
I explained that there are major problems in the Atlantic provinces. 
I understand what Newfoundlanders are going through. 
Two years ago, these quotas were set at 20,000 metric tons. 
It is almost a 50% drop from two years ago. 
The same goes for the lobster industry. 
In past years, quotas were set. 
In fact, they were not quotas but total allowable catches. 
Some lobster fishers could catch 20,000 or 25,000 pounds of lobster. 
Today, they harvest about 6,000 or 7,000 pounds. 
It is not easy.  
It takes plant workers to process it. 
That is why I say something can be done. 
I have a number of suggestions regarding, for instance, secondary and tertiary processing. 
I think that together we can succeed.  
This is unfortunate for the people in our regions. 
In any case, he has not hit the Acadian peninsula yet. 
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the remarks made by my colleague from Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question.  
Perhaps that is the problem. 
They have done so in the past and they still do.  
Our people are suffering and he is getting millions of dollars from the taxpayers. 
It is pretty hard to be nice. 
It is pretty hard to be nice to that party. 
Just look what it has been doing to the Atlantic region. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
That is why I am pleased to participate in the debate on this bill.  
I will support any measure that provides for more effective enforcement. 
In my view this legislation does all three. 
Other speakers have alluded to the fact that the agreement has 59 signatories. 
These are all very important to the conservation of our fish stocks.  
We know the great problems we are experiencing in Atlantic Canada. 
That is very unfortunate.  
They swim in and out.  
We cannot point the finger at the foreigners. 
It is about the same length of time. 
When we brought this resource into Confederation, who became the custodian of the resource? 
It was the Government of Canada. 
That is why we find ourselves in the position we are in today.  
It determines the size of the vessels that fish off our shores. 
It determines and approves the harvesting technologies that these vessels use. 
All those are decisions of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans of our national government. 
The provincial governments of Atlantic Canada have no jurisdiction or control. 
The fishermen have no jurisdiction or control. 
The unions have no jurisdiction or control. 
We have been let down big time by bad decision after bad decision. 
That is why we have the very volatile situation in Atlantic Canada today. 
People do not know where they are going to turn. 
Their futures are very uncertain.  
These are proud, hardworking people. 
All we have done all our lives is work in the fishery. 
What advice can you give us?'' 
It is a difficult question. 
Where are they going to find work? 
If they do find work how much will they be paid? 
The government has to admit its responsibility. 
Those people want an answer. 
They want a future. 
More and more of them are willing to accept early retirement. 
Thousands have left the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
There are communities with no young people left. 
People do not understand this. 
I have more TAGS clients in the riding of Burin-St. 
That is what is happening.  
The member can say not true all he likes. 
I know full well it is true. 
He can have his chance when he stands in his place in debate. 
That is only common courtesy. 
Then there is a three day period in which the flag state has to respond. 
The flag state can respond in a number of ways. 
It will enable us to better enforce the high seas. 
It was an international incident.  
We all remember Captain Canada. 
That was the end result of the Estai affair.  
The legislation in my view will certainly improve on those kinds of situations. 
What we once called underutilized species are no longer underutilized. 
Fish given to foreigners is totally a decision of the Government of Canada. 
The size of the vessels is decided by the Government of Canada. 
All of those decisions have been decisions of successive governments of Canada. 
This government has to accept its responsibility to Atlantic Canadians.  
Those governments were the custodian of the fish stocks. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
The provincial premiers put on the pressure. 
With that I would ask the member for Burin-St. 
The old TAGS, as I am sure he will agree, was far from perfect. 
The new TAGS must address the shortcomings of the old program.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments and his questions.  
It was a very difficult decision, but he did what he had to do.  
TAGS was not perfect. 
These are the stories that are not told often enough.  
I welcome the support of those members and I thank them.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
I too would like to congratulate the member for Burin-St. 
I know that my colleague has met with them.  
Bill C-27 contains certain management measures. 
The question I want to ask my colleague is as follows. 
If we want to restore confidence, that is where we should start. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his compliments.  
Concerns were raised about the independence of the FRCC. 
That is why we have this big mess today. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
This is an issue that really defines the country of Canada. 
There was a reason for doing it. 
The member for Burin-St. 
George's made some excellent points. 
Why do we not get on with it? 
To delay the passage of the bill? 
They are in committee. 
They are in meetings. 
They are in their offices. 
They are phoning their constituents. 
I understand that members opposite have a strategy. 
The solution has to be sustainable growth. 
The solution has to be new opportunities for Atlantic Canada. 
I can tell members that I honestly believe my constituents care.  
He had passed away and her two sons were carrying on the family tradition. 
I do not know, maybe you can. 
It was not a clear day. 
Other members have said there is enough blame to go around. 
We have to accept our share.  
We are the government and we have to come up with a plan. 
I believe we will. 
There has to be a long term plan.  
People in Newfoundland are demonstrating right now. 
It is a valid point and a real concern.  
They are absolutely amazing places. 
Canadians should go and see Newfoundland and Labrador.  
Unfortunately he took ill. 
I received probably 400 phone calls all of them computer generated into my voice mail. 
I wrote a letter to the editor saying that I was astounded. 
I did it in anger because I was fed up with the misinformation. 
It does not take a rocket scientist to understand. 
I wrote a letter to the editor which was published in a couple of newspapers. 
I will read part of it: 
I believe my constituents would agree with that sentiment.  
I want to correct the record on a few things.  
One of the speakers yesterday made remarks, which I will get to in a moment. 
Frankly he should know better because the area he represents is Saanich-Gulf Islands. 
The member for Burin-St. 
I am in the middle of reading the Michael Harris book Lament for an Ocean . 
I understand that the member for Burin-St. 
George's is an opposition politician. 
He claims nothing came as a result of that effort. 
Did they solve all the problems? 
The powers that are in it are the same powers that are in the agreement. 
Some members mentioned that this agreement could apply to salmon. 
That was another issue put forward yesterday. 
Some have said that this could apply to salmon. 
As an anadromous species, salmon is not covered by these definitions. 
I will set the facts straight. 
The member should know better than to make those comments in this place.  
During that time period, the enforcement officers remain onboard the ship. 
The member opposite knows it and should have said it.  
The member for Burin-St. 
George's complained about the cost of putting up the Spanish sailors in Hotel Newfoundland. 
The second option means that we would not have to do that.  
We have seen that happen. 
Canada has the hard-nosed attitude to deal with this. 
This bill now gives us the teeth to deal with problems on the high seas.  
I want that on the record. 
It does not stand on its own.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
This is one of the government's own members, a longstanding member in this House.  
Why is Canada dragging its feet? 
It required the ratification of 60 nations before it could come into effect. 
Sadly, Canada is not one of those members. 
What is Canada's excuse?  
We still agree with them.  
However, let us just take the worst case scenario. 
In fact, the Estai is still out there fishing today. 
Spain and Canada are both signatory nations. 
All evidence demonstrates that we consistently drop the ball into the international arena. 
Imagine, we have to get consent before we go after it.  
I would like to support the intent of Bill C-27. 
They have realized that there is a large biomass to be harvested. 
They have the opportunity, the expertise and the boats. 
They have invested in high seas fisheries. 
There is an international fishery in the mid Pacific. 
Some operate in both the north and the south Pacific albacore tuna fisheries.  
The Canadian government is not actively representing Canadian interests in this international fishery. 
Previous talks have been held in the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands. 
The U.S. state department is there as is the Western Fishboat Owners Association.  
Where is the Canadian government in all this? 
Is our government representing Canadian interests in the Pacific Ocean? 
Canadian boat owners have been asking where are we, where is our government. 
The legal counsel for the WFOA is puzzled by our lack of interest. 
Canada needs to get its act together and quickly.  
Our fishing interests deserve better representation. 
Our nation deserves better representation and our fishermen deserve better representation. 
Canadians are out fishing on the high seas for tuna and other large migratory fish. 
They can fish in U.S. waters but not in Canadian waters.  
Only in Canada, you say. 
Can we hope for a quick resolution?  
This is simply not the case. 
The problem is with the reporting system.  
That is a fact. 
We are totally reliant on others for the statistics. 
There is a lot out there. 
There is immense potential and Canada must be a player.  
This is the key, historical catches. 
There are two things that Canada must do immediately to address this issue. 
Another gap in UNFA relates to quotas and to allocations. 
What plan does the minister have to act decisively? 
In conclusion, if we do not have a presence, we will not have a voice. 
By its inaction the Canadian government is contributing to Canada's weak position. 
Now is the time for commitment. 
Now is the time for action. 
Hopefully the government will take heed and do the right thing.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
He mentioned there were a lot of Newfoundlanders in his riding. 
He raised the matter of the Estai . 
The member for Burin-St. 
That is why we have this bill today. 
That was only one of many similar warnings. 
The UN fisheries agreement rests on three pillars. 
One of these principles is the precautionary approach. 
That is an important point. 
That is an old dodge. 
We should increase them. 
I am referring to vessels from those countries known as distant water fishing states. 
My colleagues will have more to say about these particular provisions.  
First of all, what is a serious violation? 
Here is what the agreement allows. 
Actually, the legislation goes beyond this. 
This is a breakthrough in the development of the International Law of the Sea.  
However, we cannot rely exclusively on these provisions. 
In place of conflict, it provides a framework for co-operation.  
That is something that Canada has always sought. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
First of all, I would like to ask him a question. 
I would like to hear the hon. member for Egmont on this point.  
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his question. 
I am sure I would miss him if I was there.  
We know that the old TAGS was far from perfect. 
There were a lot of holes in it. 
This type of thinking has to change. 
We have to think of the resource first. 
If there are not enough fish, there are not enough fish. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
This is not new. 
We experienced the same thing a few years ago in the forestry industry. 
The same thing has happened in other natural resource industries.  
We have to have a renewal mechanism which will help it to grow.  
I want to commend the government on its initiative.  
The economy was very diversified.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Will Canada keep its legislation? 
Other issues can certainly be addressed in committee. 
Canada played an important role in negotiating this convention. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
They said I was wrong. 
I went on to say that I agreed that was arguable. 
My point was that this legislation is vague. 
I wanted to put those comments on record.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
If the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry wishes to respond, feel free.  
Mr. Speaker, I have no comment.  
This government has argued that it had to follow the UN convention. 
That is what this legislation is all about.  
I notice some of the members on the opposite side are shaking their heads. 
I would offer that legislation to them. 
They are welcome to contact me and I will give them a copy.  
This was negotiated in 1995. 
UN conventions allow them to act.  
The new legislation takes all the teeth out of it. 
They have to get permission from the flag state before they can lay a charge.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in Cuba the Prime Minister spoke of the winds of change. 
Yesterday a frosty wind of change chilled Hong Kong war veterans to their souls. 
Who is next on the Liberal deep freeze list of the winds of change?  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nippissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
I know him personally, since I had the privilege of racing against him. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
John Bassett passed away Monday after a lengthy illness. 
He left an indelible mark on the Canadian landscape. 
THE LATE CARLO ROSSI 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Since I was not here, I would now like to pay homage to him.  
We offer our sincere condolences to his family and friends.  
THE LATE MAURICE TREMBLAY 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
This very humane, humble and generous man has left his mark on many. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
The hon. member for Toronto Centre-Rosedale.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Umugenzi when translated from Burundi means friends of refugees.  
It has reached some 400 seniors, 200 people living with mental illnesses and 500 refugees.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
They have demonstrated what it truly means to be Canadian.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Finally, out of the ashes of the Holocaust, the rebirth of the Jewish homeland arose. 
It is this century's success story. 
The people of Israel will achieve this goal. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Israel, a rare democracy in the Middle East, is the homeland of the Jewish people. 
May your borders be safe and may all your people live in harmony. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
We are hoping for an agreement on this matter, so that all- 
The hon. member for West Nova.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
My entry was met with resistance. 
These windows mean a lot to the residents of Cornwallis. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St.-Barbe-Baie 
Mr. Speaker, Canadians own 10% of the world's forests. 
We take this responsibility very seriously. 
Forests are vital to our health, our well-being, our environment and our economy.  
I welcome this event.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
``They were just having a good time, they were laughing it up''. 
These are the words of Rob Parsons, the youth co-ordinator for Lambrick Park church. 
Canadians are working together to resolve this crisis. 
Until this happens she is the problem.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
This morning the Ontario health minister endorsed the same position. 
Quebec and Ontario governments have changed their position on this issue.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there was absolutely no change in their position.  
They said if the federal government will pay they will be happy. 
It should be a responsible government and not play cheap politics.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister avoids the central issue. 
It is the principle. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is just pure simple hypocrisy.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has run out of excuses. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we met with the provincial governments. 
We were the ones who initiated the program. 
They were not interested.  
Health is a provincial responsibility. 
We had to fight with them.  
Today we have the very courageous Mr. Bouchard and Mr. Harris. 
Let the government pay. 
Intervention in provincial affairs. 
Running the health care system for them.  
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have established a system of welfare in Canada to help these people. 
We have free medicare to help these people. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
He ends by saying: ``I am the Prime Minister's conscience''. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
At that time when the problem existed a commission was created. 
We have received the results. 
We took that file and went to the provincial governments. 
Mr. Harris cut taxes by $5 billion. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Today, the Government of Ontario gave its support to this motion. 
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask of the Quebec government to be human too. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
What sort of choice is that?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
My dear colleagues, it is becoming increasingly difficult to hear you.  
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Quebec and Ontario are calling on the federal government to compensate all victims.  
Does the government intend to review the compensation program? 
It is not a question of generosity, but a question of justice.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is not Saskatchewan's opinion only. 
I know it is the responsible thing to do. 
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
They favour this agreement because it is the right thing to do.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Where is this government's humanity? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, almost all of the provinces did not want to do anything at all. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this government is running out of provinces to hide behind.  
But the health minister and the Prime Minister do not care about that. 
They care more about class action suits. 
They should be doing the right thing and they refuse to.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They should be responsible. 
That is what people- 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe this. 
We will do what he will not. 
That is 15,000 too many.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
As for those who are sick, this country has the best medicare system.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Fearmongering about the total number of victims is not working. 
Wait and see who else is going to come on board.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
He was prepared to proceed on the basis of that analysis.  
This decision was not made on the basis of numbers. 
Perhaps that is the way the member would approach it, by calculating numbers. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Instead, they passed the buck to the federal government. 
Whenever we take action, they blame us for getting involved. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Quebec was among the provinces that did not want to pay. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to this debate for a week now. 
Why will he not admit that he made a mistake?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, those people have a great social conscience. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is what it boils down to.  
Why will he not admit that he has made a mistake? 
Why will he not help hep C victims?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
The RCMP laid only one charge. 
The decision has been handed down now in the case of the individual charged.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, once again, all these issues were discussed last fall. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
If they do not they should.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I do not believe this minister any more. 
I do not believe him when he says that he could- 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Will he do that now? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I watched them when I was in justice. 
They take a victim of crime and exploit them shamelessly. 
They are doing the same thing with health issues. 
This group is shameful in its conduct.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
So they should not ask us for something similar.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the most succinct answer is no.  
We will not sign an MAI that goes beyond that interpretation.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, look where we are now. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is completely unacceptable. 
It is cynical, it is cruel to victims and it is entirely inappropriate.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
These victims do not want to fight the government in court. 
My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The Manitoba government is critical of this government on this matter. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. member refers to Manitoba. 
The Government of Manitoba refused completely to talk about it. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
``Certainly I will be'', he said.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
On several occasions, the minister denied any involvement by his Montreal office. 
We want to hear the truth today.  
The investigation took place. 
All the facts were provided to the RCMP. 
After its investigation was completed, the RCMP laid charges against one person. 
That person has now admitted his guilt and the judge has handed down his ruling.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this file is not closed. 
The President of the Treasury Board has denied that link all along. 
Mr. Speaker, the RCMP has just finished its investigation. 
It was asked by the government to do an investigation. 
It was given all the facts. 
It has looked at it at length. 
It has accused one person and that person has now accepted that he is guilty.  
There is nothing more to do.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the government says that the hepatitis C file is closed. 
What threats will the Prime Minister use against these two provinces? 
How will they too be punished?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they did not change their minds. 
I have never done that.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Worse yet, the company did not create 450 high end jobs as planned.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The minister said he would be compassionate. 
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
When will you stand up and defend- 
My colleague, members must always address the Chair. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The program you repeatedly denounced and criticized was a generous one. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Then we will finish any business not completed from today. 
Tuesday shall be an allotted day for the New Democratic Party.  
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
These people know who they are and I am not interested in naming them.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on this. 
This is apparently what happened.  
Apparently the lock-up went on for a couple of hours. 
This was three or four minutes before the technical expiry of that lock-up time. 
There was no malice intended. 
There was no breach of confidentiality.  
Perhaps we should do that. 
The reason I permitted the second intervener was so we could get more information. 
It is outside of our purview.  
LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
For us this is in a context of how we interpret different things being said. 
THE LATE BILL SCOTT 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
He was very approachable and his good will attracted people to him.  
He started his political journey as reeve of the township of Snowdon. 
Mr. Scott won the Progressive Conservative riding nomination over seven other candidates in 1965. 
He was never challenged for that nomination after that.  
He always remembered where he was from first and foremost. 
He was a strong supporter of volunteers. 
In Ottawa Bill served many years as a member of parliament. 
On July 1, 1992 he was elevated to the Queen's privy council. 
We thank Bill for a job well done.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Few MPs can match Bill's tenure in the House of Commons. 
When people speak of Bill Scott they speak with warmth and affection. 
They speak of him as an icon among grassroots politicians. 
I knew Bill and served in two parliaments with him. 
I concur with their sentiments.  
No problem or person was too small. 
Despite his success, it never went to his head. 
This was truly a statement to Bill's dignity and sense of duty.  
Bill will be missed by those who knew him. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
What had Bill Scott done to survive all these changes?  
He had a passion for his people. 
Another of his passions was agriculture. 
He spoke of it often. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I did not know him particularly well. 
I think his constituents attested to that time after time after time. 
I recall a story after I had been elected in 1974. 
I was brand new and I did not know anybody. 
Bill Scott's family was very important to him. 
I met his wife on a number of occasions. 
He served this House well. 
He was also a good party member. 
He understood many of the problems parliamentarians have when they are brand new.  
I for one very much respected him. 
I always sought him out when I could. 
He had a good sense of humour. 
He was a jovial man and a good parliamentarian.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to raise a matter with respect to tributes. 
We need to get straight what the procedure is. 
It was my fault. 
I apologize to him directly. 
I take full responsibility for it. 
It will not happen again.  
COASTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Examples are flounder and turbot. 
Therefore, it is very important that we pass this legislation.  
I think the key that is very important here is the question of sustainability.  
We can also look at the lobster fishery. 
Yet there seems to be an overabundance in another area. 
We have this inequality.  
This is a very sad state.  
That is the economic situation. 
Far too often people do not look beyond the dollar. 
They want to balance the budget. 
We know that is not true. 
Yet there are programs that are needed to help people. 
Even then it is questionable what balancing the books really means.  
It is important that we look at that. 
We need to move toward fairness and compassion.  
Earlier today I attended a committee meeting. 
We were looking at the question of economic development in aboriginal communities. 
We were speaking specifically about the northern communities in this great country. 
Again, it comes down to the bottom line. 
There is no distinction in terms of the suffering these people will feel.  
I have said it before and I will say it again. 
We have to listen. 
We have to hear what people are saying. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member is asking for a quorum.  
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a quorum. 
Is the house ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Bill S-5 honours this request.  
The Criminal Code would also be amended to create a new offence, section 152.1, 
The committee has made recommendations to improve the section. 
The key element is the addition of an express duty to accommodate to the act. 
There are other important changes to the act. 
This bill will extend the substantive protections of the law. 
For example it will prohibit compound discrimination involving discrimination on more than one ground. 
A small permanent tribunal will adjudicate cases with greater expertise and efficiency. 
This new tribunal will operate in conformity with the principles of independence and impartiality.  
That is the commitment of this government. 
That is what we are committed to. 
These are important values and ones which I know all my colleagues support. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That has to be changed.  
It would be really wonderful if the Senate were truly elected. 
I cannot help but talk about that.  
Now how do you say this and still stay friendly? 
That is very important.  
I talk about the Senate lacking legitimacy. 
I will not talk about that at all. 
It is really unfortunate that we do not have true democracy.  
If we had true democracy we would end up with better rules. 
It is not right for me to say that I am always right. 
They will say ``Sir, you are wrong''. 
I have to admit that yesterday I made an error. 
My colleague said he did not think my computation was correct. 
I said I would check my arithmetic. 
We worked at it together. 
I am a math major and I taught math for 31 years. 
I have to hang my head in shame and say I made a mistake. 
To me that is a strength. 
That is really the essence of it.  
Or at least it did in my day. 
Before everything was homogenized and pasteurized and everything the cream would go to the top. 
I wish it could. 
There is a flaw in our process.  
The answer is no, we did not. 
It doesn't happen anyway''.  
It certainly has happened in the committees that I have served on. 
I taught for 31 years. 
I think I have a fair ability to judge body language. 
I know when people are with me or when they are agin me. 
This bill will amend several acts. 
It will amend the Canada Evidence Act. 
There is a lot in this bill that is really valuable and really worthwhile. 
There are also, as I said, some flaws.  
That is our present anticipation. 
I think, for example, of the misguided justice system in this country. 
It is not even a justice system any more. 
I am talking about this specifically because there is a question here about sexual assault. 
That is one of the things included in Bill S-5.  
These are horrendous crimes. 
Mr. Ken Epp: ``Unbelievable'' my colleague says. 
We have asked the Minister of Justice- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
However, we are also talking about the whole justice system. 
Those are the different conditions.  
That would not constitute a great deal of time of the House. 
I would think the Minister of Justice would be able to bring in an amendment. 
How many words did that take? 
There are some very important things it could do. 
It is straightforward and simple. 
It should be done and it should be done fast. 
Our members would certainly support that.  
The bill has a lot of good things in it. 
For example, there is a change to the Canada Evidence Act. 
It would enable people with various disabilities to provide evidence in court.  
We cannot be against that.  
This one deals particularly with sexual assaults. 
Sometimes, by association, I am ashamed to be a man. 
My granddaughter Kayla will soon be two. 
I cannot imagine that anyone would assault her sexually. 
But what if I am not there? 
How do we protect those who cannot protect themselves? 
We do it by our laws.  
I do not have much time for those people. 
I would be very severe with them. 
Our first responsibility must be to protect. 
This bill does not deal specifically with the protection of children. 
It deals with the protection of people who have physical disabilities. 
She is not able to speak. 
She has cerebral palsy and she sits in a wheelchair. 
This bill deals specifically with my sister and with the place where she lives.  
Five years for that. 
It would be longer if I had my way.  
That of course is the problem. 
We deal with these huge numbers and not with individual people. 
Sometimes I despair in our society. 
I do not know where we ever came from. 
I sometimes think it all started with cotton pickin' Hugh. 
He did it to us. 
I am here to say it matters and it matters a lot. 
That is horrendous and I am appalled by it.  
There is a problem here. 
This is not the purpose of the act. 
I have worked with disabled people in the workplace. 
I have worked with people who are blind. 
I had occasion to speak to him.  
We need to ask people if they are capable of doing the job. 
If a person is hearing disabled, let us go that extra mile. 
Let us provide a hearing device or perhaps a teletype unit. 
It was 25 years ago that we provided teletype devices for people with hearing disabilities.  
We all have one. 
It is an undefined term. 
We all have one. 
Like I said, it is meaningless.  
There is something else in this legislation that frightens me. 
We have not been able to put in a meaningful amendment and get this changed. 
That is their reference book. 
That is how they guide themselves. 
I have an objection to that.  
And so that is a matter of interpretation. 
Where do we actually put it? 
Where is the line drawn?  
I really have a problem with that. 
That is a totally false premise. 
I really believe that is, first of all, an insult to these people.  
I have hired people. 
When I hired a mathematics instructor I looked at the qualifications of that person. 
Can that person communicate? 
Is he or she able to teach? 
That is a false premise.  
My dad was in the RCMP, my grandfather was. 
Lo and behold he came to my office. 
What kind was he? 
There are some who think by doing that they correct other discriminations. 
They are the ones who will move up and get the jobs they want. 
Under those conditions this young man would have had the job.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
That is really disappointing.  
There are also certain amendments to the Criminal Code. 
Serving on a jury is a good example.  
Let us now turn to the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
We will see how existing case law incorporates this new provision.  
Quebec, I would point out, sets the example in this area.  
Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will support this bill at third reading. 
I now give the floor over to other members.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
This is an important gain for the disabled.  
It is important that undue hardship be defined. 
This bill is, however, by no means perfect. 
Accessibility complaints usually take two years for resolution. 
Usually resolution comes in the form of one person's complaint being answered. 
In other words, the bill does not deal with systemic problems. 
It is a complaint driven process.  
They have as much, if not more, to contribute to this country as anyone. 
For that reason, I am in support of this first step.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This is a classic example of non-partisan legislation of which we can be proud. 
It reflects a spirit that we do not often see in this House.  
It shows that the Senate can, in fact, constructively participate in this process.  
I fully support this principle and the bill in its entirety. 
In general, it is a very good piece of legislation.  
Certain problems might arise. 
It would allow them to identify the accused.  
In that case there was other evidence to consider and there were other witnesses. 
Such an offence is a morally reprehensible act. 
The Criminal Code should reflect society's revulsion of such an act. 
It creates a new specific criminal offence to address that.  
I hope it is not going to be used frequently. 
The crown attorneys of the land are going to have to make those individual decisions.  
Again it sends an important message.  
This, on its face, appears to be some form of regional discrimination. 
I believe this is something again which could be modified.  
This again is an improvement over the current legislation.  
We in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada support this legislation. 
It also clearly expands human rights in Canada.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
Bill C-244 is as much a health bill as it is a taxation bill. 
At birth the brain is far from fully formed. 
The synapses do not, however, form automatically. 
They also need loving, responsive caregiving. 
Synapses that are not used are destroyed forever.  
In some cases these effects may be irreversible.  
Neurons grow and travel into distinct neighbourhoods waiting for further instructions. 
After birth, however, environmental factors predominate.  
In a booklet entitled The First Years Last Forever it states: 
At birth the brain is remarkably unfinished. 
One of the overall concerns of the institute is as follows: 
Our youngest children and their families are in a quiet crisis. 
One of its major concerns related to early childhood development: 
The research evidence is irrefutable. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I remember that very well. 
That decade is almost over. 
We have regressed rather than progressed.  
We are extremely fortunate that our country has all these resources. 
That has to be a very laudable goal and a very laudable objective.  
They are laudable goals and objectives. 
The member certainly has his heart in the right place.  
It has helped a lot of people and we do not deny that. 
We are not saying that we should tear it apart. 
In those days it would have covered a wider sweep of the population. 
What do we have as alternatives? 
The seniors benefit will be determined by a means test. 
Those benefits are taxed. 
This was brought in in the Mulroney days. 
There is a progressive scale here. 
In addition to that, there is a guaranteed income supplement. 
We are going back to the past. 
There will be a means test. 
It is no wonder the member from Hamilton is hanging his head in shame. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is probably a point of debate.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
This bill is one more effort to his credit. 
That is what I would prefer.  
I oppose measures of this nature in principle. 
I seek to remove the complexity from the tax code, not add to it.  
The fact is the best social program is a strong family. 
The best school and day care is a strong family. 
In the current tax code there are no provisions for income splitting. 
What do those families get in return from the tax system? 
This is completely irrational.  
It is time to act. 
I know many members here agree with me. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The tax code is egregiously complicated. 
I think the important thing is that the intent and the impact is very sound. 
It is so complicated.  
I think that is far fairer in many ways.  
We are again concerned about further complicating the tax code. 
Perhaps that playing field needs to be levelled in the short term. 
Tax reform of this nature is better than no tax reform at all. 
However, let us keep our eye on the ball for the long term.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It would be administratively complex for both government, employers and individual taxpayers. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I congratulate the member for Mississauga South.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I appreciate their kind words. 
I want all members to know that I'll be back.  
I will respond quickly to a couple of points that were raised. 
The bill does focus on the middle class. 
Both the Conservative and Reform members talked about the tax code. 
Surely we will be moving toward tax reform. 
I hope we will get the process started in this parliament.  
There is no fairness. 
There is no equity. 
It should be changed.  
Finally, my colleague from Hamilton referred to the cost. 
There is no question. 
They would also pay taxes on their income, which apparently we have lost. 
She has been a very staunch supporter of her father who is away so often. 
I again thank all hon. colleagues for their very kind words. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
TRAINING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Likewise the plan will provide assistance to students with their student debt loads. 
There are many other advantages and features of the Canadian opportunities strategy.  
The Canadian opportunities strategy deals mostly with the supply side. 
It provides Canadians with greater access to education and training. 
These shortages are significant particularly when we look at unemployment and youth unemployment. 
This troubles me, particularly given the number of unemployed people in my riding. 
I refer to the problem as the skills gap.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In response, the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The government has also continued to work with the sectoral partnership initiative, SPI. 
The work being done by the sectoral councils is important. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
In his reply, the minister seemed astonished by my question. 
In my letter to the Minister of Transport, I wrote: 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am sure the member for Levis will be elated with this answer. 
This service does not use the Levis station.  
The minister announced the decision on February 20. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
This package was universal and compassionate. 
No. It helped everyone. 
I could not agree more. 
These victims want and deserve to be compensated. 
Judge Krever wants all victims to be compensated. 
The provinces want all victims to be compensated. 
Canadians want all victims to be compensated. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This will provide for up to 22,000 people.  
They also had to address the court actions against the federal government. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.20 p.m.)
