Wednesday, September 8, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Honourable Paul Lucier 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Paul knew the way of the canoe and the freedom and call of the wild. 
He understood the power of solitude at the northern end of the world. 
You have to hold the line."  
Hon. C. William Doody :
He was a very personable man, quick to laugh, easy to like.  
He was a joy to know.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The room was decorated with a series of pictures. 
However, I did not know Paul Lucier, the jokester. 
Paul was clearly holding this fish as if he had caught it. 
Senator Paul Lucier and I met in Whitehorse in September of 1975. 
I heard a great deal about Paul on that particular trip. 
I gave him a call. 
The fishing was marvellous. 
Over the years since, we had great conversations. 
During his years in the Senate, Paul was a partisan for the Yukon. 
However, he was also a pan-Canadian. 
I certainly have very big shoes to fill.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
As the North defined Paul, so Paul helped define the North. 
The air was crisp, cool, clean and invigorating. 
Why would you want to give it up?" 
The North defines all of us in ways that we cannot imagine. 
Even then, you sensed that he was on the way up politically. 
He vitriolically opposed in this chamber, and elsewhere, Meech Lake. 
It was only fair.  
Paul remained a fighter to the very end. 
Paul had a zest for life and a zest for living. 
He never complained, even when his eyes betrayed the pain that he was suffering. 
When Paul left this world, he left the air vivid with his honour.  
I came to know this gentleman from the Yukon as being very real. 
He had fierce principles, no pretension, a great sense of humour. 
That value motivated his personal life. 
He most particularly wanted to represent aboriginal Canadians. 
Honourable senators, I also attended the service in Whitehorse. 
I saw where he lived, among his mountains, along that river. 
We also saw the strength that he had drawn from them.  
I would say that Paul was first amongst those representatives.  
They gave him a terrific send-off. 
Senator Carney would remember. 
Our new senator, Senator Christensen, was there. 
Not that I would consider Paul as God. 
After all, he was a Liberal.  
That brought some chuckles from a few of us in the crowd.  
He had a whole lot of what people like about other people.  
That to me sums up the wonderful man. 
We know how much we will miss him. 
Please accept our sympathy and our very best wishes.  
I will never forget that. 
In the early 1980s, we were talking about the Constitution of Canada. 
Finally, section 35 was added to the Constitution.  
I will never forget Paul. 
He had so much concern for the people of the North.  
There was talk at that time about seats for the provinces. 
Today, we have more representation for natives in the territories.  
He appeared before the committee as a witness. 
I never expected at that time that he would later be appointed to the Senate.  
A meal cost about $2.50. 
Now the prices are up to about $20 a meal. 
We used to go there and talk about the old days.  
Paul told me to trap them. 
He said "Some people are interested in trapping beavers." 
One day, a white man came along and trapped on my property. 
They always joked and said, "Willie, you are a native. 
Why do you need to hire a white man to trap on your property?" 
I will never forget that.  
I had gone up there to do some electrical work. 
Those are the kinds of memories that I have of Paul Lucier. 
He did a lot of work for us. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Late Honourable Hedard Robichaud 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
In 1963, the Right Honourable Lester Pearson appointed him Minister of Fisheries. 
In was in that position that Mr. Robichaud left his greatest mark.  
To quote the Honourable Louis-Joseph Robichaud: 
The others were perhaps stronger on the administrative side.  
I had the opportunity to listen to him, and to consult him. 
In 1968, Mr. Robichaud was sworn in as a senator. 
Respected and admired, he was ever at the service of the people. 
He has left an indelible mark on his former colleagues and compatriots.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Mr. Robichaud was born in Shippagan, New Brunswick. 
Like me, Hedard was born in Shippagan. 
I am proud to say that, yes, we are related! 
Hedard was the son of Jean, who was the son of Georges. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators then stood in silent tribute.  
Preventable Injury-Smartrisk Foundation 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Too many Canadian are dying needlessly. 
This equals almost one person per hour.  
However, still more needs to be done. 
Our world must not become simply a place where people cope.  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
The issue of literacy is becoming more and more important. 
This problem must be addressed. 
It was found that 48 per cent of Canadians are at the two lowest levels. 
A former Progressive Conservative government created the National Literacy Secretariat in 1988. 
That was 11 years ago. 
I am pleased that the current government has seen fit to maintain this important organization. 
Support for this bill would show that we are serious about increasing literacy.  
British Columbia-Proposed Expropriation of Nanoose Test Range 
I believe it will cause irreparable harm to our country.  
The Inauguration of the Carrefour L'Industrielle-Alliance 
Unveiling of Bust in Honour of the Honourable Raoul Dandurand 
Its inauguration will inject new life into the city.  
Few of us are familiar with the achievements of this distinguished Montrealer.  
He was named a Grand Officer de la Legion d'honneur. 
Senator Dandurand was a visionary, a great Montrealer, and an eminent Canadian. 
Shelter Strategy for Aboriginal Peoples 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
Public Sector Pension Investment Bill 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Is this the proper use of taxpayers' money? 
Is this a new initiative of the Chretien government? 
When will this abuse of power end?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Honourable senators, Laurier's contribution to Canada's development cannot be disputed. 
He holds a special place in our history, as do others who followed. 
Sir John A., as we all know, was a Conservative. 
He was a visionary and a nation builder.  
We in Parliament often decry the fact that Canadians know little of our history. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Everyday, I am reminded of the great contribution that he made to our country.  
Amendment to Excise Tax Act 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Better than the one we got!  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I recall well the debate that we had at that particular time.  
Yesterday, we introduced six outstanding Canadians as new senators in this chamber. 
That particular piece of legislation will evolve in due course, as it should.  
Bill S-10 is an important piece of legislation. 
Honourable senators, I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I accept the point being made by the Honourable Senator Roche.  
Early indications are that Indonesia itself would not accept such a force.  
I was asked yesterday how many Canadians are present. 
In international eyes, the UN is in a controlling situation.  
Honourable senators, I regret that I have not yet seen that statement. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Sanctions would have an adverse effect on the poorest people of that nation. 
That is why Minister Axworthy made the statement that he did.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I explained this matter on an earlier occasion. 
I congratulate Senator Cochrane again for raising this subject. 
She was and continues to be an educator. 
Outstanding Answer to Order Paper Question 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will make inquiries as soon as I leave the chamber. 
I hope an answer will be forthcoming shortly.  
Public Sector Pension Investment Board Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Adjourned 
The document that was distributed to everyone has, in fact, two pages missing from it. 
I have had a revised copy of the document distributed to everyone's office today.  
The government pension plan is a defined benefit plan. 
These plans are among the best in the country. 
They provide defined benefits which offer inflation protection. 
Honourable senators, we had hoped that this would happen over the summer. 
Its role will be to invest future contributions to the pension plan. 
None of those shortfalls have been paid by employees. 
I have difficulty with this notion for a number of reasons. 
The government believes it has entitlement to the surplus. 
In any event, it is an issue which will be resolved in the courts. 
In fact, the bill does not create an entitlement to the surplus. 
That has been made clear from the hearings and comments from witnesses. 
Therefore, their pension plans are dealt with through employee associations. 
They are not separate pension plans in the sense that they contain separate funds. 
This was not done.  
These changes to the Canada Post pension plan are necessary for a strange reason. 
In fact, there is no fund. 
That, I believe, underlies the rationale for that part of the bill.  
We had a set of hearings in June, and another set in August. 
We would like more in the bill, obviously. 
In particular, we would like to see the joint management plan in effect. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I should like to put a question to Senator Kirby. 
Did I hear you correctly?  
The honourable senator did hear me correctly. 
In that sense, the bill does not create an entitlement. 
The government believes it is entitled to the surplus. 
I wish to come back to the premise of your question for a minute. 
However, I will try to answer your question directly.  
It is my understanding that this issue is not settled. 
Second, I wish to be clear when we talk about the surplus. 
An actuary's forecast is based on a whole series of assumptions. 
Early in the 1990s, two things happened. 
Fundamentally, we are dealing with what one would view as an accounting entry. 
That is what we are dealing with. 
We are dealing with an accounting and an actuarial issue.  
I am aware of the nature of the $30 billion. 
Is that correct or incorrect?  
I believe that is incorrect. 
The two cases now before the courts are not directly related to the surplus question. 
I am looking at Senators Meighen and Oliver, who were with me. 
I see they are nodding, if that helps.  
It does not, however, deal directly with the question of the entitlement to the surplus. 
I believe that answers your question directly.  
The second question flows from the first. 
It is my understanding that that is the case. 
That is why we sent it back. 
A potentially very serious situation for the future exists as a result of this stalemate. 
We were not prepared to impose one. 
That did not happen.  
They had not agreed to anything. 
That is why there are no amendments. 
Unfortunately, it did not.  
That was a problem in the committee meetings. 
The time schedule for the hearings had been set by the Senate in June.  
There was some confusion from both sides as to what happened. 
Indeed, to the best of my knowledge, they still have not taken place.  
The two cases are before the court. 
I was wrong in stating that they deal with the government's forecast. 
In a sense that is right. 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
I think the government is simply proceeding on the assumption that they own the surplus. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to continue, honourable senators?  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I have three simple questions.  
Could the honourable senator tell us whether that meeting took place? 
He mentioned that we are talking about a $30-billion surplus. 
Why not share that $19 billion with those who have paid the premiums?  
I wrote it down. 
I would be pleased to try to find out and supply an answer tomorrow. 
I know the letter to which my colleague refers. 
I simply do not know if the meeting took place. 
Therefore, I cannot answer the question about what happened.  
I cannot quite remember the second question.  
First, the surplus, in a sense, is "fictitious." 
The surplus does not exist in a fund. 
What was your third question, senator?  
I do not think an assumption automatically generates an entitlement. 
They feel quite angry and that they have been wrongly dealt with.  
The moral issue is staring you in the face. 
Honourable senators, one cannot explain away that perception. 
Indeed, one often says in politics that the public's perception is reality. 
If that is the case, there certainly are unhappy people. 
It is also clear from the many comments made by witnesses.  
Nevertheless, the government is entitled to it. 
Who speaks for the people who are affected by this bill? 
We do not believe this stuff about it being "non-existent." 
You see, a surplus does not exist but a deficit does. 
Is that not interesting?  
We really have no surplus here. 
They are not really taking the surplus.  
We all know there are serious flaws in the bill. 
Our second concern has been the governance of the plan. 
The plan should be jointly managed. 
The key words are: 
...government's sincere intention to undertake whatever measures are necessary...  
Last June, we believed the government's sincerity. 
On June 17, a motion was passed that this bill: 
That the Committee report back to the Senate no later than September 7, 1999. 
We did that because the minister said that he would act. 
We were not acting under a false assumption. 
Honourable senators, the committee has reported. 
While we have made a number of additional recommendations, no action was taken. 
There has been no progress over the summer. 
Nothing has been achieved.  
It seems that the unions do not get it. 
That is why he used those words.  
They were not interested in meeting with the unions. 
That is what Mr. Bean recounted to us. 
I have no reason not to believe him. 
I think this is clearly contempt. 
Such an attitude holds Parliament in contempt, and the Senate, in particular. 
All of us on both sides of this chamber should be upset about that action.  
Mr. Bean did offer to resume negotiations without any pre-conditions in August. 
The government chose not to accept that. 
That would have been a very simple thing to do.  
Democracy works because we respect each other. 
That is why they are having all that trouble in East Timor. 
They shoot people who disagree. 
The first 28 pages govern the management of the pension plan. 
It is about the non-existent surplus of $30 billion.  
Why would we do that? 
Why would Liberal senators go along with that?  
Once again, zero progress has been made. 
There has been only opposition from people affected by this bill. 
This bill is not just about a $30-billion supposed surplus. 
That is government arrogance. 
They were, perhaps, a little embarrassed.  
That is what Bill C-78 is about.  
We will be here until the fall. 
What is the problem? 
My remarks apply equally to Bill C-32. 
If I am not mistaken, Senator Taylor suggested some amendments. 
That should be brought to us. 
However, there will be amendments to the bill, I am certain.  
On motion of Senator Stratton, debate adjourned.  
International Position in Communications 
Consideration of Report of Transport and Communications Committee-Debate Continued 
These new technologies know no borders. 
Our cultural diversity will therefore have to stand up to international competition. 
They all must have access to the new media. 
However, we must be watchful of what happens on the Web. 
However, the subcommittee believes that something must be done to solve this problem. 
Why could we not do the same?  
According to him, culture is: 
[...] the communal conscience bringing people together.  
I think honourable senators can easily understand why we are so proud of this report. 
The world's technological revolution brings many new challenges. 
I believe that Canada has all the tools to face them.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Several neighbouring countries, including the United States, use external monitoring. 
This is certainly something that interests a great many people. 
The Internet began in California on September 2, 1969. 
Most of the members of this group are North Americans. 
The conference is being held in Munich for reasons I am unaware of. 
The name of this very recent group is the Internet Content Rating Association.  
On motion of Senator Spivak, debate adjourned for Senator Johnson.  
Bill to Amend-Motion to Adopt Report of Committee Negatived on Division 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
In light of that, I wish to move the previous question.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Those honourable senators in favour of the motion will please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Those honourable senators opposed to the motion will please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The whips confirm that the bells will ring for one half-hour. 
The vote will therefore take place at 5:45 p.m. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
2. the then Deputy Minister of National Defence; 
3. the then Acting Chief of Staff of the Minister of National Defence; 
4. the then special advisor to the Minister of National Defence (M. Campbell); 
5. the then special advisor to the Minister of National Defence (J. 
6. the persons occupying the position of Judge Advocate General during the relevant period; 
7. the then Deputy Judge Advocate General (litigation); and 
8. the then Chief of Defence Staff and Deputy Chief of Defence Staff.  
"9. the present Minister of National Defence.."-( 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
The motion should be ruled out of order.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, we should look at the wording of the main motion. 
The original motion focuses on the operations in Somalia and not in any other place.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I have reread the main motion carefully. 
I agree that the main motion deals specifically with the Somalia deployment. 
It does indeed say: 
I therefore declare the amendment out of order.  
Honourable senators, we still have the main motion before us. 
Does some honourable senator wish to adjourn the debate on the main motion?  
Honourable senators, it is my intention to speak to it on another occasion. 
That being so, I would move that the debate be adjourned in my name.  
On motion of Senator Atkins, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, it is now six o'clock. 
Is it your wish that I not see the clock?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we have now reached the end of the regular Order Paper. 
We were at Inquiries. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I shall not keep you very long on this matter. 
The facts of the matter are quite straightforward, so I shall be brief.  
It took a lot of courage to give that testimony. 
Therefore, I would like to have your assurance.  
Every employee deserves the protection of that due process.  
Now we turn, honourable senators, to the date of the job action against Dr. Chopra. 
Beauchesne's 6th Edition , citation 109, provides as follows: 
Thus a witness may not refuse to answer on the grounds of self incrimination.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask Senator Kinsella a question. 
I agree entirely with what he says in the matter of principle. 
Can the honourable senator substantiate his statement that the doctor believes that this occurred? 
Honourable senators, the same thought occurred to me. 
That is a useful answer.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Kinsella has raised a serious question of privilege. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am sorry, but the matter cannot be adjourned. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I have listened most attentively to this debate. 
He is totally convinced of this. 
The response by his bosses did not indicate any connection. 
That is where the dilemma lies. 
How can we be satisfied as to which is the case? 
Hon. Anne C. Cools:
Honourable senators, may I remind you of the phase that we have reached. 
I thank Senator Kinsella for bringing forth the question of privilege. 
I am satisfied that there is prima facie evidence. 
I also thank Senator Kinsella for his survey of the facts in this case. 
I support Senator Kinsella's question of privilege. 
I would ask that Senator Kinsella table that document with us today.  
I am pleased that steps are being taken to look into these matters. 
We hear of this sort of thing quite frequently. 
Committee members expressed their great concern. 
There is no need to belabour the point. 
We will go forward from there again.  
The Hon. the Speaker:
Honourable senators, I wish to make three brief points. 
Senator Kinsella has covered the situation. 
The committee does not deal with matters of constitutional affairs or of national defence.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I want to be certain that we are not doing anything that is improper. 
I will take the matter under advisement and report as quickly as I can.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
