EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 218 
Thursday, April 29, 1999 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
I can understand the pain the people of Taber are feeling today.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, gas prices are getting a lot of attention these days.  
Why are gas retailers willing to take the heat for government taxation?  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
The centre officially opens its doors to the public tomorrow, Friday, April 30, 1999. 
The task of locating a job can be very difficult. 
I would like to congratulate the individuals who made this project work. 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
She is an outstanding Canadian and a great role model for us all.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Winston Churchill once said that the greatest virtue was courage. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Keep up the good work.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
So much for Liberal attention and compassion.  
The Prime Minister wonders how he will go down in history. 
He need have no illusions. 
The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Thursday, April 29, is International Dance Day. 
To the first nations, dance is a vital component of their ancestral heritage. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
But laws will not prevent random violence. 
We must look at the root problem. 
ALLIANCE CONSEIL EN MARCHES FINANCIERS 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Co-operation is always the best approach to carrying out our projects.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
This event challenges us all. 
The victims in Alberta and Colorado are like canaries in the mine. 
The cultural environment is toxic. 
Let us clean it up before it is too late.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The families of Jason Lang and Shane Christmas are in our thoughts today. 
Yesterday Canada lost some of its innocence. 
We need to come to terms with how and why this happened. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Yet that is exactly what has happened after 30 years of neglect.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government has in fact increased the defence budget. 
This is the first time in over a dozen years that budget has been increased.  
We have given them pay raises. 
We are improving their housing conditions. 
We are doing a number of things that improve their quality of life.  
That will help them to do the job of peacekeeping.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Now that a war is on the defence minister is surprised. 
We have invested $1 billion in this budget.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are providing a very significant contribution to this allied effort.  
They have CF-18s that are well equipped to do the job. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Troops are ready to leave for Macedonia as we speak. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They try to say that they want additional money to go into the budget. 
It is a just cause that they are involved with. 
We want to make sure they have the proper equipment. 
They do and they will continue to have it.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is wrong. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They said ``You can't go fast enough. 
Take it out of the pensioners''. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is wrong again. 
The PM has committed our troops. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We will have buses after question period that will take members down there. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the situation in Kosovo is intolerable. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
The response was ``so much the better''.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised important questions. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is why our Minister of Foreign Affairs is in Moscow today. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is what we have been doing.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
If the Americans can do this, why can't we?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are doing a lot better than that.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
It is effectively silent''.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is incorrect. 
I would suggest that the member is wrong in that interpretation of the agreement. 
I have a copy of the agreement here. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Why is this government effectively silent? 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We have made that very, very clear. 
We are very firm on that position. 
We will act to protect the rights of women. 
They are protected in this treaty.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I would like an answer, this time.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
It is one or the other.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member opposite just does not get it. 
An agreement was reached in December. 
The hon. member for Rosemont.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I can assure him that I do share his interest in our students in Quebec. 
We received a letter yesterday afternoon, at the same time as the media. 
We will take time to consider the proposal it contains. 
So, I must tell you that I am pleased- 
The hon. member for Rosemont.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
I am looking after the management responsibility.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It must be understood, before- 
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, is it any wonder our taxes are so high in this country. 
Four big-time drug dealers were caught with six tonnes of hashish in Vancouver. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The hon. Minister of Public Works.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I repeat that I do not know the specifics of the case. 
Therefore, I cannot accept the premise of the member of parliament. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mrs. Yoro is in the eighth month of a high risk pregnancy.  
The Sunday before, the deportation failed- 
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.  
The minister's actions were both cavalier and uncivilized.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what an accusation. 
The hon. member is making accusations without being able to verify the facts. 
I am greatly surprised by the attitude of the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
There has been a proposal gazetted. 
That is a normal part of the consultation process.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
It was elected, it tells us, to defend the rights of taxpayers.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the same minister.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Did Nav Canada know that it had to replace the tower when it bought it?  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Nav Canada has successful implemented sight specific procedures at the airport. 
The expansion will help alleviate the problem. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
However, the proposal does raise certain questions. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
That is what it is doing. 
We are giving it back to the taxpayers because it belongs to taxpayers.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
These benefits are set out in law. 
The supreme court indicated the surpluses belonged to the province.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is, indeed, the proper course of action.  
That is what all Canadians want to ensure happens.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Accordingly, we believe we have a package that meets- 
The hon. member for Perth-Middlesex.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
The auditor general also commented on this in his annual report.  
Would the minister tell the members of the House of Commons about this equipment.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We do have the best possible equipment. 
It is all recent vintage and all purchased within the last nine years. 
All of them are down at the Cartier Drill Hall right now. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Nathalie Drolet, another member of the team, voiced a similar opinion. 
The government has no business selecting trainers.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Now the work of these officials will go to individual ministers and individual governments. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Our staff are already working to arrange that.  
Tomorrow the business of the House will be Bill S-22, respecting preclearance. 
On Monday we will have an allotted day.  
Are we concluded with the questions? 
The hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona.  
That is a shameless way to conduct House business as far as I am concerned.  
I thought the hon. member had a question but perhaps not. 
Mr. Speaker, why not? 
This is not a point of order. 
Frankly it was out of order. 
I think we ought to move on. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I will have to explain what I am rising on. 
Therefore I seek unanimous consent for the following: 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
They realize we are debating a report from committee for quite a few reasons.  
Why do we need to debate this committee report? 
There will be no earth shattering changes made to the system. 
There will not be a response from the government.  
A couple of examples come to mind right off the bat. 
It was called Keep Mining Off the Rocks . 
Another example is the recent 48th report- 
I know he wants to address the report he has moved concurrence in. 
Mr. Speaker, I started by mentioning that the 70th report deals with Private Members' Business. 
I am building the foundation of why this report is an important one. 
I am talking about the importance of the work of committees.  
It sacrifices its time and energy. 
There is give and take in committee and again it is brought forward. 
I am just building the argument. 
The trouble is that all that work is for naught.  
It talks about bills being drafted in clear, complete and effective terms. 
They must be constitutional. 
They must concern matters of significant public interest and so on.  
I do not have any quibble with that report. 
I will continue to build the case, the background, the underpinnings of this argument. 
Another report dealt with was the televising of committee work. 
It was the 48th report of the same committee. 
It was a unanimous report brought forward to the House of Commons. 
It talked about how we got together.  
I was on that committee and spent more than a month there. 
We listened to procedural experts. 
We listened to constitutional experts. 
The press gallery made presentations. 
We listened to people from the print media. 
We talked on and on.  
The conclusions we came to were unanimous. 
The government whip was on that committee. 
The chief opposition whip was on that committee. 
What has happened to it? 
What has happened to the televised committee report? 
Recommendations were brought forward that all of us had agreed to. 
They talked about the need to show democracy at work. 
MPs spent all this time in committee. 
We cannot even get a Hansard from committees any more.  
It has been sitting in its hands for weeks. 
These types of reports are abused by the government. 
A study sometimes involves hundreds of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours. 
What comes of it? 
When decisions are made in committee no one even knows what happens to the recommendations. 
I had to break the news to the poor fellow. 
It would be tabled in the House with our unanimous support. 
Then it would go into that big round filing cabinet, never to be seen again. 
That is what would happen to it. 
That is why the 70th report, another piece of good work, is largely ignored.  
You educated the parliamentary secretary?  
This report deals specifically with Private Members' Business. 
Even Private Members' Business is no longer dealt with fairly in committees. 
This particular committee, the subcommittee, is not the problem. 
It chooses which ones are votable. 
They come into the House. 
We often pass that same bill. 
We send it off to committee, and then what happens to that bill in committee?  
I have seen it happen before. 
People bring in a bill. 
It passes at second reading. 
All of us give a standing ovation. 
What happens to it? 
Let me give the House a couple of examples. 
I saw the standing ovation for the hon. member for Mississauga East. 
I was one of those standing. 
It was a great bill. 
I supported the bill. 
I thought it was a good bill.  
The hon. member brought it into the House and got a glowing standing ovation. 
They should smirk then on CTV news. 
They should smirk then while The National on CBC has them covered. 
We cannot see all this happening. 
This was a little different. 
Instead the bill got sent to committee. 
Of course, when it comes back here, there is nothing to deal with. 
It has all been eliminated in committee. 
There is nothing we can do. 
It is a complete waste of Private Members' Business time. 
It is a complete waste of the committee's time. 
The 70th report lays out the criteria for important Private Members' Business. 
I do not know what number we are up to today. 
The report is simply tabled, and that is the end of it. 
It is worse than cyberspace. 
It is gone, never to be seen again.  
Most Canadians have no idea of the important work of committees. 
They are not televised. 
For some reason the Liberals will not allow them to be televised. 
They are not reported. 
All of that is ignored because there is not a television camera allowed. 
I sat in my seat to listen to his speech. 
I guess the Senate does it better than we do''. 
We are in the middle of a war in Kosovo. 
Both the government and the opposition got a clip on the news. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
There was a sunset clause that it would end this June. 
What we will do is renovate a room''. 
That was the very recommendation to which the committee said no. 
I will leave it at that because that is the important question.  
Is it just that we need more television cameras? 
Is it an ego thing for parliamentarians? 
What is the issue?  
Perhaps 10% of members of parliament are present now in the House. 
No, they are off at committee, doing important work. 
They are having clause by clause discussions on bills. 
They are proposing amendments to legislation. 
Members are bringing forward proposals on policy initiatives. 
They are investigating the role of Canada in Kosovo. 
Members are doing all of this important work.  
We will not know about most of it. 
A lot of work is involved in coming to a unanimous conclusion.  
The report is tabled in the House with much fanfare. 
Maybe there is a press conference downstairs. 
We all say that it was a satisfying bit of work. 
The fact that nothing happens is the big issue.  
Our constituents could see us deliberating, for example, an important agricultural issue. 
When a report is finally drafted, nothing happens. 
They should at least merit a response from the government in a timely fashion.  
That brings the work of parliamentarians into question. 
I say that the light of television cameras would do something to reverse that. 
It would nourish democracy. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
I would like to be able to continue to tell them that. 
Standing Order 109 states: 
I would like my colleague's comments on that.  
We gather signatures from the opposition parties. 
They always turn it down. 
I should not say always, but 90% of the time.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, thank you for recognizing me. 
What about report 48?  
I am being asked to comment on another report. 
The 70th report is an excellent report. 
I have no doubt. 
I am quite optimistic. 
I do believe the government will respond within the 150 days in a favourable way.  
I can share some of the frustrations that my colleagues opposite have about that. 
We did not quite make it all the way that day.  
The ultimate objective is to have more televising of committees. 
Does it frustrate me a little bit? 
That the House do now proceed to the orders of the day.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
In fact, many would go beyond simply calling it a crisis. 
More than 100,000 Canadians are homeless. 
The backlog of houses in first nations communities in the north exceeds 4,500.  
This is not unique to Winnipeg North Centre. 
We are talking about absentee landlords. 
We are talking about insurmountable barriers to home ownership.  
Neighbourhood patrols are springing up. 
There are economic development initiatives. 
Bill C-66 is going in the wrong direction. 
It is absolutely the wrong remedy for the critical situation we are facing. 
What happened to that promise? 
What happened to that election platform? 
Why do we have Bill C-66 before us today? 
We have heard nothing on that front.  
We have to have a national housing policy. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
We understand the importance of building a strong, competitive housing industry. 
We know that good housing creates sound communities and a strong country. 
We know that housing has a major impact on the economy of Canada.  
Permit me to read this extract from the bill: 
Surely nobody would dispute the importance of these objectives. 
This is what the Government of Canada expects. 
This is what the people of Canada deserve. 
This is what Bill C-66 is all about.  
What more could the hon. member want? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
That is exactly where it came from.  
Where is the heart in the government? 
It is absolutely unbelievable that it can continue to do this.  
As usual, the Liberals have reformed the Tory policies and have made them even worse. 
That is absolutely unacceptable and shameful.  
Let me put some personal perspectives on this. 
These people have lost their homes. 
I wonder where the heart is in the government. 
Whatever happened to the Pearson days? 
It has completely abandoned its responsibility.  
It goes on and on and on. 
Even the UN has discredited our policies when it came to that.  
We are just the federal government. 
We absolutely have no heart. 
We do not really care about you anymore''.  
The government has proven that in many other industries. 
Other than that, what are we going to be telling our children? 
I am very proud to be their colleague.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I have the honour to inform you that the Honourable Peter deC. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I should say right from the start that we are opposed to these amendments.  
The question here is whose side are we on? 
It would back even further away from helping with social housing.  
We have to cut back so we can bring the finances in line''. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Lester Pearson was leader of the opposition. 
They talked about a new and just society, about participatory democracy. 
All of a sudden it went poof and the whole thing disappeared.  
This is an open debate. 
We have 10 minutes on each of these amendments. 
This minister is very ambitious. 
He wants to take on the Minister of Finance as a leadership candidate. 
Now there is homelessness.  
I want to know what the vision of that ministry would be. 
Will there be funding for that ministry? 
A New Brunswick member is here in the House. 
What is the vision? 
How do we find homes for people?  
Of course the taxes go up. 
They go up very unfairly and indiscriminately. 
It is an unfair tax system in Canada. 
In any event, we have a lot of time this afternoon. 
I want to know where he stands.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
No. Each one will be done as they come up on a voice vote.  
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 2. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will deal with the point of order of the member for Kelowna. 
Would you be so kind as to have this seen to?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 5. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly, Mr. Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Bill S-25, an act respecting the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada.  
Ms. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP) moved: 
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 21.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ) moved: 
It is totally incomprehensible. 
It is contradictory to say the least, and completely inconsistent.  
This attitude is a bit hard to understand. 
But this is to completely ignore Quebec's demographic weight. 
It would then have to spend $480 million. 
The difference is $117 million.  
This makes no sense at all.  
This makes little sense. 
Housing is an important issue. 
There is no need for a bill like this. 
There is a major shortage of resources. 
However the federal government has a lot of money. 
After dumping responsibilities, it has a huge amount of money. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I notice a number of members of the Liberal Party are here. 
It is to their advantage to listen carefully. 
I must have hit some kind of chord. 
They all agree that they should be here listening to this point.  
The government does not have a national housing policy. 
There is a little bit here and a little bit there. 
There is a whole bunch of hodgepodge itsy-bitsy pieces coming together. 
I submit that it is not. 
That would be the provinces and the municipal governments.  
It comes to grips with many of the issues we are dealing with today.  
It is not only the city of Toronto that has done good work. 
Of course they have because the problem is before them virtually every day. 
The city of Kamloops provides another example. 
That is exactly what happened.  
The concept of housing co-operatives is a good one. 
It has been a benefit to all of them. 
They have expressed their own individualism through housing. 
There are different kinds of co-operatives. 
My colleague was commenting on my speech. 
I am so happy that he was impressed with it. 
I just wish hon. members opposite would be as impressed as he was. 
I want to come back to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
It is not restricted to Canada. 
That is not what Canada Mortgage and Housing should be doing. 
The loophole is not closed in this legislation. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will make some brief comments on the amendments in the second group. 
These small business people should not be excluded from the bill. 
My comments are relatively straightforward on these items. 
I have two thoughts on this. 
Second, cabinet already provides policy direction to the CMHC on many issues. 
This program has set federal-provincial relations back several years. 
I think my hon. friend and I are in agreement on this.  
This goes beyond consultation, beyond co-operation or collaboration. 
This is too restrictive.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
The government does not support these motions and I will explain why.  
I cannot repeat it often enough. 
The government understands the importance of helping Canadians meet their housing needs. 
Surely nobody could dispute the importance of these objectives. 
That is what the Government of Canada expects. 
That is what the people of Canada deserve. 
That is what Bill C-66 is all about.  
What more could the member want? 
That is a vision I think every Canadian would support.  
VOISEY'S BAY NICKEL PROJECT 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC) moved: 
There are still some outstanding issues on the questions of processing and refining. 
Let us examine the advice carefully prepared through the work of the environmental assessment panel. 
But we must adopt a reasonable approach. 
I see it firsthand on a regular basis. 
This has much more to do with getting the fundamentals right.  
Ontario as an example exports the least raw material per capita. 
Moving forward with the project will be helpful. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
I will give the House some background to that.  
This project is important to that region and to all Canadians.  
The price of nickel at that time was about $3.50 U.S. a pound. 
It is now about half that price.  
Inco, as I understand it being a business, has to look at other options. 
Is it going to be Voisey's Bay or New Caledonia? 
One might ask why the member for Etobicoke North would be concerned. 
I am concerned as a Canadian. 
That is the only way that Inco seems to feel it can proceed. 
It has its business people who understand business economics. 
They are accountable to their shareholders. 
That is the only way it sees the project working.  
That is quite tragic. 
Sometimes we cannot have the full cake and have to accept half the cake.  
If that could happen I know it would be very positive.  
The project at Voisey's Bay is a staggeringly attractive proposition. 
That is a huge stumbling block.  
I support the member opposite in the sense of moving the project forward. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
The hon. member certainly has more faith in the federal government than I have. 
The victims of tainted blood have been waiting for over a year for compensation. 
The Hibernia project has been another Liberal failure. 
Churchill Falls is another example. 
Newfoundlanders are better served by negotiating on their own terms.  
This is no longer a business venture. 
It is a three ring political circus.  
Let us look at the players already involved in this project. 
Inco Limited is involved. 
I applaud the patience of Inco's president, Scott Hand. 
The premier of Newfoundland is also involved in this matter. 
In Alberta we are working to remove the barriers impeding economic progress and development. 
In Newfoundland they are erecting new ones.  
Is Newfoundland open for business? 
Nobody questions where Mr. Tobin's loyalties lie. 
Environmental regulations are another tax on Canadian businesses. 
There is a balance that must be struck.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois supports this motion. 
In order to explain our position, I will give some essential background and history.  
They also grow certain medicinal plants there.  
But let us get back to the issue before us. 
These claims are still not settled and now there is this nickel mining project.  
In short, these lands are their universe.  
This mining project is a good development opportunity for Labrador. 
It could even, based on my information, benefit communities as far as Sept-Iles. 
The motion before us generally goes in that direction.  
The group tabled its report on April 1.  
Indeed, this is the way we will have to go, it would seem.  
These vital problems are still on the back burner. 
In other words, the project is a good thing, but not at any price.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He spoke about the TAGS program, for instance. 
The nickel concentrate from the mill would be sent elsewhere for processing.  
The first round began that spring. 
On July 23, 1998 Newfoundland suspended negotiations. 
The negotiations were being conducted separately with each of the two native groups. 
Negotiations with the two aboriginal groups are continuing. 
The federal government is strongly committed to forging new partnerships with native peoples. 
I understand that formal consultations are expected to begin on May 3, 1999. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. members who have spoken. 
It has helped us in many ways. 
It has served in many ways to benefit Newfoundland and Labrador.  
Unfortunately it has not always worked as well as it could have or should have. 
We still have an unemployment rate that is twice the national average. 
There has to be something wrong. 
There has to be some way that can be rectified.  
Let us look at some of the problems we have. 
Our unemployment situation is obvious. 
That would be comparable to 7,500 people leaving Prince Edward Island. 
We could be a have province. 
We could contribute positively in a revenue sense to Canada. 
That is one example.  
We can supply raw materials and labourers, I suppose.  
That is not the nature of Confederation as we want it to be. 
There is a difference. 
There is an opportunity for the Government of Canada and the province. 
We are not asking for a whole lot.  
What should we do, just basically supply raw materials?

His Excellency Vaclav Havel 
President of the Czech Republic 
House of Commons Chamber, Ottawa 
Thursday, April 29, 1999 
Hon. Gilbert Parent (Speaker of the House of Commons):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister):
I speak of course of the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.  
A regime that chose to block your aspirations in life.  
You may ask what kind of republic I dream of. 
Mr. Vaclav Havel (President of the Czech Republic):
Who will take over the various functions that are now performed by the state?  
Let us first speak about the emotional functions. 
Upwards applies to various regional, transnational or global communities or organizations. 
This transfer of functions has already begun. 
In some areas, it has progressed quite far; in others, less so. 
Allow me to give you one example. 
With this example I would to illustrate the following. 
Instead it must equitably mirror the multipolar world of today. 
More channels mean more balance and a wider mutual scrutiny.  
I am talking about something else. 
This value is humanity. 
Human rights rank above the rights of states. 
Human liberties constitute a higher value than state sovereignty. 
The category of ``interests'' tends to divide rather than to bring us together. 
It is true that each of us has some specific interests. 
Principles unite us rather than divide us. 
Nevertheless, the Alliance is fighting. 
This war gives human rights precedence over the rights of states. 
I see this as an important precedent for the future. 
Hon. Gildas Molgat (Speaker of the Senate):
You faced a totalitarian social structure. 
You were harassed and imprisoned for your beliefs and activities. 
You were denied the opportunity to complete the formal education of your choice. 
But never, never did you weaken.  
The free world admires you.  
We thank you for your address.  
It is one of stubborn adherence to the highest political principles.  
Our country, our dear Canada, is fortunate to have had a democracy since its beginning. 
Thank you for being with us on this day.
