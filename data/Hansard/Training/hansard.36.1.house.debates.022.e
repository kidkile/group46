EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 22 
Tuesday, October 28, 1997 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent for the proposal of the hon. member?  
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The first steps of this transfer to the Yukon Territory were taken in the 1980s. 
It will be done at the territorial level.  
This is of major importance to the Yukon First Nations. 
The Yukon Council of First Nations has indicated its support of the bill.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I am sure the Speaker knows all about that.  
Bill C-8 has been kicking around basically off and on for quite a while. 
The federal government is demonstrating its commitment to political devolution to the Yukon territory. 
While Reformers support the legislation we also have some concerns. 
The anticipated date was then extended to July 1997. 
The power gained by Yukon through the legislation is economic. 
While I was there I spoke with a broad section of Yukon residents. 
I have to question the wisdom of this government on that issue.  
Most important, this act incorporates grassroots concerns and amendments. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
We realize that this region presumably has enormous potential. 
It is somewhat unfortunate. 
Such is this federal government's centralizing attitude. 
It is also important to look at the Yukon from a geographical perspective. 
The Inuvialuit forms the Yukon's northern border. 
As you know, there are four major Inuit regions in Canada. 
The Inuvialuit was the first region to be recognized in the self-government agreement. 
Self-government agreements are being negotiated for these regions.  
To the east are the Northwest Territories. 
These are the great first nations right next door to the Yukon.  
This is what concerned us at the outset. 
The government had in fact undertaken to move it. 
So that is the historical fact, and unfortunately history has a tendency to repeat itself.  
Quebec is in the vanguard and intends to stay there. 
We are keeping an eye out for the interests of the First Nations.  
The Council for Yukon Indians was there. 
Some of them have signed final agreements, others are still working toward that stage. 
The trip to Whitehorse was really something. 
This ties in with the bill before us today. 
My daughter travelled with me and she found it rough too. 
There is this terribly loud noise and everything is shaking inside the plane.  
My answer was: ``Of course not. 
It must be a joke''.  
It was a thrill of a sort. 
We made it to Dawson City. 
By the way, Heritage Canada owns half the town. 
The buildings have all been declared heritage buildings and they reflect the old days. 
It is almost like finding ourselves in the Far West. 
I take this opportunity to salute my aboriginal friends out there.  
We had a drink and watched a French cancan show. 
It was quite special.  
Are you still in your DC-3?  
The first nations welcomed me with open arms and took me on a long tour. 
It was really extraordinary. 
We caught a 20 lb salmon. 
I can tell you personally that we caught a 20 lb fish. 
I was involved in an unfortunate incident. 
I would also like to recall the social contract at the time. 
Today, people tend to forget that. 
We are paying for these people and we are tired of paying for them''. 
We systematically regulated the lives of the native peoples. 
There are no rights of succession. 
The act contains some provisions that are hard to apply in today's reality. 
Now, I would like to give you an overview of the progress in negotiations. 
People are wondering what we said. 
And it not easy for me either. 
People thought that the issues of self-government and territorial claims had been settled. 
Since then, we have continued to make progress. 
These communities joined those that had already signed agreements.  
Negotiations with the Dena Council of Ross River are in the preliminary stages. 
I remember that, at the time, there was a particular issue. 
These people had a lot of reservations about how things were conducted. 
They were the minority among aboriginals in the Yukon. 
I notice today that at least they have gone beyond the preliminary stage.  
We will have to be careful with this.  
As for the first nation of Carcross-Tagish, meetings are now under way. 
Right now, negotiations are focussing on rural lands. 
Agreements have been signed on a certain number of claims. 
The first nation should soon be submitting claims regarding specific sites. 
The final agreement should be signed by March 1998.  
It is expected that negotiations will be wrapped up in December 1998. 
There is a dispute over this. 
Negotiations are, therefore, still under way.  
Likewise, any kind of centralization does not fit in with our philosophy.  
I was telling you that we had concerns, and they are the following. 
They are saying that they are in agreement. 
There has also been a change in government. 
We will be decide whether we should move amendments in the standing committee.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
I would like to thank the people of Yukon for bringing me here. 
It is very significant. 
In 1898 a separate Yukon territory was created. 
In 1902 our first small civil service was established. 
It affects every single person who lives in Yukon.  
In 1996 consultations on the transfer of northern affairs programs began. 
Devolution is an essential part of aboriginal self-government and self-determination. 
Federal devolution is part of a parallel process within the Yukon government. 
It opens opportunities of economic development for Yukoners. 
This bill is facilitating the implementation of the working agenda of the territorial government. 
Devolution is not by any means downloading of responsibilities by the federal government. 
Devolution is good government. 
I urge the House to proceed quickly with this bill. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I will share my time with the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester.  
These revenues are currently valued at $2 million per year.  
There are a number of areas of concern in this bill. 
While such a plan has been developed, it has not been adopted. 
Part of that transfer is regulatory power. 
We support the legislation. 
We think it is important. 
We agree that we should move forward with it.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Most community groups and organizations support this legislation in the Yukon area. 
Clauses 6 and 8 of the new bill address those issues. 
It requests that it proceed expeditiously. 
It is prepared to work with the First Nations groups.  
Certainly we support that and we support them.  
I believe they are addressed. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I raised it in my speech as well.  
Second, the federal government has a fiduciary link with the native peoples. 
However, I believe that clauses 6 and 8 address his concerns. 
I believe that amendments can be made to the bill. 
It is not perfect. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the said motion?  
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
Bill C-6 will establish these bodies. 
We also conducted extensive consultations about the legislation per se. 
These consultations have proven highly productive. 
More and more we are looking at environmental problems in total. 
These are examples of good planning and good public government. 
The territorial government strongly supports the concept of public valley-wide boards.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
The Saskatchewan River runs through my constituency. 
Historically it was a major trade route for the fur trade. 
We have it all. 
We are Canada's most illustrious constituency and I am proud to represent it.  
All rights are held in common.  
I found in the material several one page letters. 
I submit that will be a vain hope as we look further through the legislation.  
Canadian taxpayers will be burdened for years to come because of their policies. 
Resource companies, we know, must conduct their affairs in an environmentally sound manner. 
Those facts are not in dispute.  
The decisions rendered must be timely and arbitrariness must be minimized. 
That letter was received in the office of the minister in the spring of 1996.  
We believe that wider consultations are the answer to those negotiations.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Unfortunately, I have never been in the Mackenzie Valley. 
As we can see, this bill meets its target in this respect.  
These will be five member boards. 
This type of parity for committees can be found in several bills. 
I think this is a laudable effort.  
Once again, the goal is native participation. 
The area is fairly specific. 
A permanent regional panel will issue licences according to the needs of the settlement area. 
Before these agreements, certain laws had been put forward by the federal Parliament. 
These laws will be amended by the bill before the House today.  
You have to picture the area, which the Mackenzie River cuts right through.  
I will explain why in my conclusion.  
Again, the aboriginal community and the government will be equally represented. 
This is a positive development.  
Once again, the bill amends an existing act. 
So it is more than just the environment. 
It is important to assess these, and the bill provides for this.  
I mentioned this earlier. 
This definitely has a very adverse impact on the environment. 
The impact was immediate and cumulative. 
This could be the job of a board or a department. 
So, I think the famous parity for all boards achieves this objective. 
So it is an area very rich in oil and gas.  
Canada and the world were at war. 
The war machine depended on oil. 
Their production therefore reached a peak at this time. 
Norman Wells is the easternmost point of the Canol pipeline. 
Was this done at the expense of the native peoples? 
I have just told you that it was. 
That is the big question. 
Naturally, there are grey areas. 
Many Indians also live there. 
They have also preserved their culture.  
Recently, this word was given a narrower meaning in the political arena. 
I think it is only doing them justice to mention these peoples' names. 
The problem is not a new one: it has always existed.  
Let me give you an example.  
But in the case of aboriginal people, their lives would never be the same. 
Afterward, they saw their property and their lands slip from their control. 
Colonization concentrated initially on the agricultural lands of the south. 
The same thing is still happening today. 
We can see the spirit behind the treaties, that they were mutual agreements. 
These events created a very fevered climate.  
There were no discussions, these clauses were simply applied. 
So these are the infamous clauses referred to as the extinguishing clauses.  
I find it important to give an overview of the purpose of the two agreements. 
It is worthwhile taking a closer look.  
That is the famous extinguishing clause I referred to earlier.  
They want to move away from the infamous Indian Act. 
Another cultural trait of aboriginal people is that they often think of future generations. 
Mohawks, among others, often speak of the seventh generation. 
It is the same everywhere. 
They want to review the original treaties and interpret them. 
And the government is rejecting this wholly or in part. 
This brings me finally to the position of the Bloc Quebecois.  
I ask therefore for a quorum count.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
An hon. member has called quorum. 
Do we have a quorum?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair has determined that there is a quorum in the House.  
This may be a reflection of government behaviour toward aboriginal issues in recent years. 
I feel it is quite symptomatic of what is going on. 
I would like to thank my colleague nevertheless.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It does not serve well either side of the House.  
I salute my colleague opposite who does a tremendous amount of work on this issue. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The government whip is quite correct. 
It means the opposite rather. 
I think that is what my hon. colleague meant to say. 
That strikes us as a major problem.  
Today they are faced with a bill that will be including them.  
They wanted complete sovereignty over their land. 
I felt it important to say that.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
The Gwich'in Tribal Council is on record supporting the bill. 
We support the bill and speedy passage of the legislation. 
The Liberals have made polluters responsible for policing themselves. 
Canada is falling behind its international obligations to protect the environment. 
That is good for aboriginals of the country and good for Canada as a nation.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
This is no ordinary bill. 
It and its huge valley need to be respected and protected.  
I am only just learning the history of this land myself. 
When they did that, they got the government's attention. 
Of course, the federal government appealed. 
Assuredly, this has been a slow process.  
Certainly a great many people got tired of waiting. 
We are all hopeful that their many years of dialogue have borne fruit.  
However, I am looking forward to the hearings before committee to give it closer examination.  
These are good things and surely we have made some headway since 1973. 
Yet if they represent one principle it would be one related to good government. 
The valley is 4,241 kilometres long. 
The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada supports this bill. 
We support its goals and aspirations. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
He obviously wants to negotiate.  
He talked about first rights of refusal on many activities. 
Is that the correct way to go? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his questions. 
He raises some valid points. 
It is second reading of the bill. 
We have a way to go yet. 
Many people have moved to the north in the last couple of hundred years. 
The bill applies to everyone in the north. 
I think it is all-encompassing and reflects the rights of everyone. 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
That is quite clear. 
These are to be interpreted. 
When we interpret them each individual and group comes up with its own interpretation.  
First, clause 5(2) should give some comfort to those individuals. 
Clause 5(1) states that it does not affect the Indian Act. 
There are also advances for the Government of the Northwest Territories. 
The government is not into a regime of overregulation so that industry cannot move. 
That is not what this government is on about. 
That is not the extent to which the government would like to operate. 
These boards are extremely important. 
The intent of the government is to serve all fairly. 
We are at second reading. 
That is extremely important.  
We do not hear much about that. 
The diamond industry is unlike any other. 
How many businesses do that? 
Its profit over that same period is estimated at $4.3 billion.  
It will receive only $.2 billion. 
So far that is the information we have and the information I have. 
Despite advertising claims, diamonds are not forever. 
This apparently is the standard. 
Nonetheless there is that kind of development in the north.  
In the Northwest Territories we have other activities that are ensuing. 
That is why we seek a balance with this legislation. 
I have had access to industry members who do not necessarily favour it. 
The new boards will have powers under the legislation. 
This will be enforceable in the same manner as an order of the courts.  
That is apparently the law.  
The human factor is a multifaceted one. 
It is one which has many sides.  
We live in a heterogeneous setting. 
We have many people with different levels of education and skills. 
We have people who are in industry. 
We have people who have an extreme attachment to environmental issues.  
We continue in our own way in the Northwest Territories to find the balance. 
I as a legislator am tasked with this. 
Let them come forward with their views. 
They can best speak to them. 
I cannot speak on their behalf.  
We have an opportunity to build. 
We have an opportunity to share. 
We have an opportunity to work together. 
I do not see any mitigating factors which would prevent us from doing that. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
We are talking very strongly about the principles of this bill. 
I have not heard any amendments come forward. 
I do not have a list of amendments. 
That would not be acceptable. 
It would defeat the original purpose of the bill.  
I think those will be entertained.  
At various stages amendments are entertained. 
However, I do not know of any specifics from the constituent groups yet.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Is there a willingness on behalf of the government to follow that through?  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
However, we must take caution.  
We must be conscious of that and that is not easy to do. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
I am a little concerned about the numbers of boards and jurisdictions we are creating. 
This bill creates about five or six different boards for a very small population. 
I appreciate the environmental concerns and the fragility of the environment. 
I have two questions for the hon. member.  
Second, I am concerned about the devolution of powers by the minister. 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague raises some very important points. 
That is easier said than done. 
We do not always have friendly partners in that process.  
When this bill comes to its final resolution it will do that.  
The issue of devolution is a little more complicated. 
It would not be guided on every detail of what it does. 
It requires legislation to enact those boards. 
They have the power to guide themselves.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
She mentioned quite proudly the diamond mines in the north, and justifiably so. 
I want to make sure this House is fully aware of that. 
There are many concerns with regard to this bill in the north. 
From some of the letters we have we know this is not what happened here. 
We know that the concern is there due to this legal language. 
We know these people cannot afford to come to Ottawa to address these concerns. 
We also know there are some areas they cannot get to, say Yellowknife.  
I have done it. 
I am sure other members of the House have done it too. 
These people deserve to be heard. 
We have to make sure there is absolute clarity when we make such legislation.  
I question that and I worry about that.  
We all know what happens in the mining industry. 
We have to address some of these concerns. 
I sat and still sit on the natural resources committee. 
We worked very hard on it. 
It sits on some shelf gathering dust. 
The lack of clarity has to be the first concern.  
We have to consider seriously a system that could be under-resourced. 
We have to be concerned about many of these areas.  
These are legitimate concerns. 
Mr. Speaker, yes, it does have an obligation. 
It also has an obligation to everybody and to listen to everybody. 
That is what the House is supposed to be for.  
Just because part of it is right does not make the whole right. 
Why would we pass anything that has anything bad in it? 
It should be 100% good if at all possible. 
That is good legislation.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I was rather interested in my colleague's comments.  
Mr. Speaker, at least three new boards will be created. 
There is absolutely no way that will speed anything up. 
We all know what happens when we get tied down in bureaucratic red tape.  
I sat on the natural resources committee. 
We looked for a one window shop. 
Now we have created more than that. 
More bureaucracy is exactly what we are creating. 
Will it cost more tax dollars?  
It will definitely cost more tax dollars. 
There is absolutely no doubt about that. 
It will cost a fair amount in more tax dollars for more uncertainty. 
That is exactly what we are doing.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
I have a couple of questions for the hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap.  
I am a bit confused. 
We want something that is simple and that natural resources will understand. 
I do not think my hon. colleague can have it both ways. 
There is no way he will be right 100% of the time. 
We all know that.  
Could I have an explanation?  
Mr. Speaker, I will answer the last question first. 
It is under-resourced to handle this issue at this point in time. 
As for being right 100% of the time, no. 
I am not sure about those who have passed away. 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Support services will be provided by a small technical and administrative staff.  
It will be reviewed every five years.  
A regional land and water board will also operate in each of the settlement areas. 
Special panels may be established for this purpose. 
The assessment will determine whether a full scale review is required. 
Once a decision has been made, it will be implemented by the appropriate regulatory authorities.  
Those principles are recognition, respect, sharing and responsibility.  
They are sharing with us in the co-management of development and resources. 
This is a more open, visible and locally responsible form of managing resources.  
My question is the following. 
I think he said something about the number of panels. 
I explained that there were six. 
We will return to the debate after question period. 
It being almost 2 p.m., we will now proceed to statements by members.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what has institutionalized apartheid created in Canada? 
The hon. member for Scarborough East.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
One woman in nine will be diagnosed with the disease. 
I urge the government to keep this is mind.  
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
I understand that's going to be a Hill of a party.  
MISSISSAUGA FIRE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
The Mississauga team won the competition with the fastest reaction times.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend Victoria provincial court judge Brian MacKenzie.  
Judge MacKenzie's ruling clearly puts the interests of victims first. 
Three cheers for Judge MacKenzie.  
CAMETOID ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
We are developing the foundation- 
The hon. member for Vancouver Kingsway.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
What a noble expression to show his love and appreciation to Canada.  
They built the railway for Canada and they defended Canada in the wars. 
I wish to recognize their special contributions like those of Mr. Lee.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
An impaired driver killed his friend. 
A woman tried to hire someone to kill her daughter. 
None of these criminals served time in jail. 
Because of the Liberals' conditional sentencing law. 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
At the one year mark this government has much to be proud of. 
MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The minister was cynical enough to tell the government of Quebec how it should behave. 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Canadian savings should not be handed over to the compulsive gamblers in the casino society. 
Canadians want safe money in safe havens.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Beaudoin's career is closely linked to the growth of Bombardier. 
The company excels in design, manufacturing and marketing.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
Let us keep the approvals flowing.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Is their policy going to be based on science? 
Is it going to be based on an agreement with the provinces, consumers and taxpayers?  
Yesterday the truth came out. 
It gives new meaning to the words green tax.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There is an upcoming conference in Kyoto. 
There is a large gap between different parts of the world. 
One thing is clear. 
While I was in Great Britain I- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
All the other G-7 nations have released their targets already.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
How high is the Prime Minister prepared to hike- 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Yes, he said that. 
I never treated any of my members of Parliament with that type of unacceptable language.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There may be some members who would dispute that.  
What we have here are two little boys arguing over whose green tax is bigger.  
Let me ask the Prime Minister this. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is a very serious global problem.  
As usual the member for Edmonton North cannot be serious about anything.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Canadians need assurance on this very serious subject. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We will take a responsible position for Canadians.  
It is a serious problem, despite the lack of opposition policies in this field.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General of Canada.  
Now, Michel Deslauriers is also the warden of Institut Leclerc, a federal penitentiary in Laval.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will have to confirm those allegations and get back to the member.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Now, he claims to be unaware of what is going on in his own department. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very good to establish due process.  
I am going to look into this and I will get back to the member.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, truth is stranger than fiction. 
This situation is like a scene straight out of Omerta , the television series.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
First the Minister of the Environment talks vaguely about targets. 
Now perhaps the Prime Minister is finally ready to perform.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The position of Canada is very clear. 
We cannot go and have nothing happening in Kyoto. 
We would like to have real progress in Kyoto. 
We are developing a Canadian position with all those who can participate. 
The hon. member for Halifax.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that is the story with everybody except Canadians. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
It made a commitment in the red book to do so. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Maybe we can help the government today in this problem it has. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there has been extensive work done within the Department of Finance. 
We have advanced the yardstick substantially. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
He was bubbling over with enthusiasm for the hated GST.  
That is your mulligan for today.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Someone will find him sooner or later with his head in the sand.  
The GST tax has existed in Canada for a long time. 
We have opposed the GST. 
That is still my position. 
We have harmonized with many of the provinces so that it is working better.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The prime minister went so far as to say we introduced it. 
I think that will leave Canadians teed off. 
Now we know how he keeps his score down.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is exactly what I did.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the charges that have been made this afternoon are very serious. 
I am going to look into them. 
If the facts behind the charges are true, action will be taken.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Why doesn't the minister?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is a very difficult place in which to work.  
It is hard for the employees. 
We will look into it. 
It is very serious and if those allegations bear out action will taken.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very important that due process take its course. 
We need to look into this. 
As we do, if allegations that are made are borne out action will be taken.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the prime minister was right. 
There is 16% youth unemployment in the country right now. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
And if the Reform Party has a study showing otherwise, then let us see it.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The government supports it and we have made this clear. 
I therefore wonder why the hon. member did not understand earlier.  
We held a free vote on the Newfoundland question. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
We are glad to know where he stands.  
He has had a day to make inquiries. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Will the minister respond positively? 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I think that is very commendable. 
We share the hon. member's concerns.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
This task force was set up to- 
I would ask the hon. member to go directly to her question, please.  
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like thank the hon. member for her very good question. 
As a government we have been moving on all fronts. 
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Did the minister consult with the board chairman, the board and in fact- 
The hon. Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
When I look at the opposition Conservatives I may have to revise my view.  
We have appointed competent members of other parties to boards and commissions. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Dunn will do the real work. 
Mr. Fewchuk will probably bait hooks.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
And clearly the Reform Party believes we should fire Jack Frazer as well.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the suggestion from the Governor of North Dakota was very interesting. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Does the wheat board minister agree with that ruling?  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Therefore, we will soon be introducing an amendment to follow up on our commitment.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Western Canadian farmers are legitimately anxious about the transportation of their grain.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Preparatory work is under way. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
The government is in the process of considering those recommendations.  
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Whose interests is the minister protecting?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We received new information. 
We are reviewing it. 
We will discuss it with the tribunal and a decision will soon be made.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
For four consecutive days toxins have been reported in the news. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot comment on a specific case in question. 
It is a matter that may be taken under appeal. 
That is a decision for the Attorney General of Ontario.  
I would, however, remind the hon. member that my predecessor amended the Criminal Code. 
It is a matter of application of those principles.  
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Aboriginal people view land and other resources as their common property.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We in the Reform Party would have absolutely no disagreement with that.  
It is simply not going to develop this concerted co-ordinated effort. 
There are many people in the Northwest Territories who are saying much the same thing.  
However that is simply not occurring.  
The system was far better defined and unified in other agreements. 
In fact it is not.  
This situation is not only occurring in the Northwest Territories. 
This situation is occurring across the country.  
The province of British Columbia through the current land claims process will be balkanized. 
Let us imagine trying to do business in a situation like that. 
Development becomes almost impossible.  
However that simply is not occurring. 
Did the levels go down? 
No. Did they stay the same? 
What are the social outcome and social costs of the horrendous situation? 
It is getting worse. 
We have to look at the issue in a new way. 
The social costs are being borne by the people. 
We must stop separate development. 
It must not happen any more. 
We have to stop thinking that it is them and us. 
We have to think that we are all human beings. 
We must use our differences. 
There is much we can learn from each other. 
There is much beauty in the aboriginal cultures of our country that we can use.  
This is virtually unknown in the medical community. 
Alcohol and drug abuse are of epidemic proportions. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I was assured that I would get a copy of that.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca for his speech. 
I have a few comments to make.  
He was asking why we have three new boards. 
The first one is the planning board. 
It is quite simple. 
It is according to the law. 
We need to take care with the planning.  
My question is what does industry want? 
I have one simple question for my colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend from the Liberal Party for his question. 
He actually asked three questions.  
He mentioned the boards. 
It is a problem to have three boards. 
People who are involved in this are asking why are we investing in three boards. 
This is bureaucracy running wild.  
Perhaps that would be a better investment of taxpayers' money. 
That is what we in the Reform Party would like the government to do. 
We are for both. 
It is by having a co-operative relationship with both that both can benefit.  
My friend asked about the situation with the land claims. 
Negotiations are taking place only with aboriginal people often behind closed doors. 
These are the problems we have with many of the land claims situations.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Fourth, will it provide environmental protection in an efficient and cost-effective manner?  
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for his extremely succinct and pointed questions. 
It has ground the whole process of development to a sickening halt.  
Some government members are nodding their heads. 
My friend also mentioned employment for aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples. 
Does it lead to economic self-sufficiency? 
It has the potential to do that. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
I would like to ask him what happened. 
Where did the money go? 
The best person to answer it is the minister of Indian affairs.  
Rather than doing that, we know that the unemployment rate is increasing. 
That is absolutely worse than we could possibly imagine.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I would also like to thank the volunteers who so tirelessly worked on my campaign. 
We are dealing today with an agreement made by the Mulroney government. 
Specifically the Northwest Territories Chamber of Mines has four main concerns.  
We cannot be making up the rules as we go along.  
Our current court system is weighed down enough with litigation. 
This should not and cannot happen.  
However, the question remains, at what cost? 
We should look more closely at what the consequences of this bill are.  
Second reading deals with the principle of the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I have a few comments for my colleague.  
The Reform Party complains about having three boards. 
I would like to explain the activities of the boards.  
When one travels from Yellowknife to Inuvik it is far. 
The Mackenzie River is the longest river in the country. 
This will be my last remark before my question. 
All it talks about is mining. 
However, it is more than a resource management act. 
Our real problem is the level of bureaucracy the government is creating. 
It is creating another level of bureaucracy. 
Therefore, we definitely have a concern about this.  
The member should listen to what the Reform Party has been saying. 
That is the problem we have with this bill.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
The Mackenzie River Valley is one of the greatest river systems in the world. 
My friends say that there are too many boards. 
As the parliamentary secretary has already said, the Gwich'in want to have a board. 
They want to be represented. 
They want to have control over the large area in which they live. 
The Sahtu want to have a board. 
We might have three. 
We might have one. 
That is the way things are done. 
People's responsibility has to be allowed to work.  
I said it this morning and I will repeat it now. 
I have heard nothing more than fine words. 
I thank the member for asking the question. 
We do not have a problem with the Mackenzie Valley. 
I think the member is right. 
It is nice clean water and all the rest. 
The First Nations have every right to take full advantage of it for their prosperity.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Clearly that should be a very important motivation for all of us for the future.  
On the surface this bill seems to work in that direction. 
It appears that it is going to get aboriginal and non-aboriginal people working together. 
Under those systems, who had rights? 
We all know how those rights were determined. 
Kings had all the power. 
Kings were not elected. 
When they came down the birth canal they were already elected to be king. 
They did not have to run for office. 
They did not need anybody's consent. 
The serfs comprised the great majority of the population. 
They were people with absolutely no power, with absolutely no say. 
They were people who were virtually owned by the king. 
They were the property of the king. 
The king could do whatever he wanted with them. 
He did not need to ask permission. 
He was an absolute ruler and they were absolute servants to the king.  
Look at the Soviet Union, a resource rich country. 
For the most part the people there live in dire circumstances. 
It is not an accident. 
Now we see some hopeful signs with the emergence of democracy.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We will do a count.  
And the count having been taken: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Indeed, there is no quorum.  
[ And the bells having rung: ] 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We now have a quorum. 
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Let us compare that with the situation in the former Soviet Union. 
We have a democracy in North America. 
They have been largely Liberal administrations I might add, largely Liberal governments. 
Liberal governments for the most part have dominated the House of Commons during this century. 
It is the Liberals who have constructed the welfare state and the dependency.  
They do not know why and they are angry and they are looking for answers. 
They are looking for some respect.  
What kind of respect is that to show to a human being? 
I reject that 100% completely and totally.  
It should not be tied to membership in a native band. 
That did not come from me, it came from the auditor general.  
In other words, it had no affect. 
The government has known about this problem for 10 years. 
The government is without accountability. 
The reality is it sits on its hands and does nothing.  
Look at the issue of the Stony reserve in Alberta. 
The people on the reserve had to cry out through the media. 
Now we see, as a result of the forensic audit, charges are being laid. 
The truth is coming out. 
Hopefully the whole truth will come out. 
I was speaking with some aboriginal people yesterday who came from southern Ontario. 
I will not get into the details of it. 
I believe that aboriginal people across the country have caught on to the system. 
I think they know the system better than the government. 
I think most Canadians embrace the notion of that. 
I think that is a great thing for our country.  
I submit that is not the way of the future for this country.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Skeena for his speech. 
We say in French he made une affirmation gratuite. 
I do not know how to translate it. 
He talked about patronage. 
On the next one, the land and water board, there will be seventeen members. 
If we named them it is because they are good people. 
They are dedicated people and competent people. 
All the nominations we have done for the Northwest Territories are very good nominations. 
My question is very easy. 
Does he mean that equal and full partner means assimilation? 
We have seen the results and live with the results. 
What is the government doing now? 
I cannot believe this.  
When those principles are violated there are consequences. 
I would ask the hon. member not to look at me. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Aboriginal people would be a majority in the Senate. 
We were the majority of the population of Canada.  
It is a step in the right direction. 
Resources are the wealth of the country. 
Without income there would be no economic cycle. 
To create new wealth the resources are being tapped away. 
If we include aboriginal people at this level it is a start. 
The management boards are a step in the right direction. 
Madam Speaker, I will try to respond very succinctly.  
I thank the hon. member for his intervention. 
I disagree with him on one point he made. 
He said that resources were the wealth of the country. 
I beg to differ. 
People are the wealth of the country and resources are the tools. 
There are areas with high populations of aboriginal people. 
They are local to the area. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
It is certainly a beautiful place to visit. 
I would say it is the most beautiful riding in Canada.  
Family is a very important part of my life. 
We all make sacrifices to be in the House. 
Family is the life of our country.  
Apathy is at an all time high. 
It is certainly something that needs to be addressed and examined.  
We think about the fact that real people are affected by legislation. 
Those are things that need to be addressed. 
We also support that aboriginal people be part of the process. 
That is where our objections would lie. 
In essence it shuts down the ability for real involvement by people. 
It was a very good analogy. 
The equality of all Canadians is important.  
He was a veteran. 
He served the country and fought in World War II. 
He really instilled a sense of democracy in me personally. 
We had many debates about freedoms and democracies. 
In fact he lost many of his friends. 
That is the principle for which he and his colleagues fought.  
We would like to see that implemented. 
The Mackenzie Valley is a great area, part of a great country. 
That is where my main objection lies.  
Madam Speaker, I thank you for listening intently to my comments. 
Some are scared about the cost.  
The Mackenzie River is 4,000 kilometres long. 
They do not move from Yellowknife to Inuvik just like that. 
We are transferring the power to the people of the First Nations.  
I have one question for my friend. 
I thank the hon. member for his question.  
First, I would look at the leadership versus rank and file aboriginal peoples. 
It is basically the process we are talking about. 
We are not concerned about the intent of the bill. 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
I am sure we all remember when we said equally glowing things. 
I appreciate that because it makes us remember why we are here.  
I worked with the previous member for Churchill, Elijah Harper. 
He is a Cree Indian. 
You do not have the foggiest notion of what I am talking about. 
The member used a very poor analogy. 
They have a system of government and a way of operating.  
They worked out things together. 
They did a little fighting now and then and took a few prisoners. 
We have to learn that.  
Then there is this nonsense about them all wanting to have equality. 
That is a very hard term to get hold of. 
My friends in the Reform Party use it without due consideration. 
If they are somewhere else, they will follow those rules. 
That is not what they want at all. 
We did not pay much attention to it.  
Some of the early treaties, yes, we have read about them. 
That is what they want to do again. 
That is what this is bill is aiming toward. 
It is going to take time, goodwill. 
I hear catch words and buzzwords.  
Madam Speaker, it is an honour to address the comments of my hon. colleague. 
I do not see Mr. Harper today. 
We would have nothing to do with that kind of comment.  
He talked about power structures and abuses of former governments. 
We are looking for a change in the balance. 
We are listening to rank and file aboriginal people. 
There are people that are concerned with power structures within their reserves. 
Equality is not a buzzword here. 
That is where our policy lies.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Members need to examine some of these measures on their merits. 
I assume this is what this bill is about. 
We have been pretty blunt about pointing that out when it happens. 
First, the bill creates four new boards. 
It creates a land use planning board in the Gwich'in settlement area. 
It also creates a land use planning board in the Sahtu settlement area. 
And so we have a proliferation of boards. 
Then a little ways away another group will do the same thing.  
That is a nice purpose. 
Integrated sounds very nice. 
Is this system integrated? 
It does not give any criteria for eligibility. 
It has no process for the appointment. 
This decision making process is under resource. 
Again, the bill does not allow that.  
By the way, this is not the only decision making structure in that area. 
There is the territorial government and the councils of the people. 
There will be these levels of decision makers, government and authorities. 
I am not at all convinced that this structure is workable.  
That is the way institutions and organizations and decision making bodies operate. 
The goal is laudable. 
Nobody here is saying that.  
There must be some clearly developed lines of how this is going to work. 
This is entirely missing in this bill. 
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague across the way. 
She also said that it was irresponsible. 
The responsibility here is criticizing something and not putting something down on the table. 
That is the way the Reform Party has always been. 
Responsibility is being elected to this place.  
Do not just stand and criticize. 
If it has some constructive ideas, bring them forward instead of criticizing.  
It seemed to be its specialty.  
In area after area we have brought forth constructive alternatives.  
Mr. Speaker, I first of all thank my colleague for his speech.  
He is talking about the criteria for naming the people to the board. 
There is just one criteria for naming people to boards, and that is competence. 
Second, the member talks about court, about delay and about frustration. 
We are just replacing what we are doing now. 
The member said that the boards are not integrated. 
It is totally the opposite. 
It is integrated, totally integrated. 
It is for the people living there.  
My question is quite simple. 
The bands living there agree. 
The minister of renewable resources agrees. 
The people and the Government of the Northwest Territories agree.  
Why does the member not take this into consideration? 
That is the whole point. 
They deserve the very best. 
Those are the kinds of tactics that the Liberals continually use when you criticize them. 
This is complete nonsense. 
If the criterion is competence, then what is competence? 
There are all kinds of people who are competent but competent in different things. 
What kind of background do they need? 
What kind of knowledge do they need? 
What kind of perspective of the area do they need? 
Those are the kinds of things that need to be spelled out.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Some people are calling it the western arctic.  
There are competing interests between tribal groupings, Metis and non-natives. 
It is certainly anything but singular. 
We do not get enough opportunity to debate this very important issue.  
However there is a better way.  
There are some laudable goals in the bill. 
There is a warehouse of resources and it is mostly mining oriented.  
The mining sector has a world full of experience. 
They view some of the concerns in several ways.  
Then there is the lack of clarity in the process for selecting members.  
Those concerns need to be dealt with in a very clear way in this legislation. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I have been approached by a few members and I want to clarify something. 
Most of the House will know this already. 
ALLOTTED DAY-CANADIAN FISHING INDUSTRY

FAIR WAGES AND HOURS OF LABOUR ACT 
It seems the Liberal government has a long history of broken promises.  
Fast forward the VCR to April 24, 1997. 
The Liberals, it seems, were in a bit of a panic mode. 
The Reform Party was gaining momentum. 
We say, hands off. 
Why are the contractors going to do this? 
They are simply going to hedge their contracts. 
They are going to build this in. 
We can expect to have more bureaucrats as a result of these schedules.  
Let us look back into history a bit more. 
There is no rationale there.  
Here are examples of workers who say they are not being remunerated fairly. 
This is more than I can comprehend. 
This sort of rationale escapes me.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Very often he has interesting things to say. 
It was in 1900. 
The act first emerged in 1935. 
A very good thing for contractors to know.  
Another very good fair transparent way.  
As a result the obligation to pay the fair wage remained. 
It is very important that we understand this new process. 
This method would seem to be a reasonable compromise. 
We are all concerned that we do the right thing.  
What would the member propose for the other jurisdictions?  
The member has put a lot of thought into his motion. 
I congratulate him on beginning this important debate, but we are at the beginning. 
There would be no surprises for anyone.  
I believe the member's motion must be defeated.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
It is a clear and noble purpose. 
And the GST recently. 
We know how these folks blow with the wind. 
So I am worried.  
We received the press release on April 24. 
That shows how serious this government is.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The government then stopped posting fair wages in 1987. 
On April 24 of this year the concept of the fair wages schedule was restored.  
This Reform motion is an attack on the taxpayer. 
I will tell the House why.  
It is an issue of honesty, accountability and fair play. 
This is where fair-minded contractors lose out. 
This is where the taxpayer loses. 
It helps to get the best value out of every dollar spent. 
It helps to support fair-minded contractors. 
It works toward the health and safety of all Canadian construction workers.  
This motion deserves to be soundly defeated. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
There are so many places to start I hardly know where to begin. 
She says she would like to see that and so would I. 
However I would put to my hon. colleague that people are being paid fair wages. 
There is quite conclusive proof that people are being paid fair wages at the time.  
I propose that the system now is working. 
Case in point, there are .00002% 
of the cases where it is not working. 
Any time after that would have to be overtime.
