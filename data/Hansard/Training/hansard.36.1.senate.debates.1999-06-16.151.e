Wednesday, June 16, 1999 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Bernie Faloney 
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
Honourable senators, Bernie Faloney was an exception. 
From 1955 to 1956 he served in the U.S. Air Force. 
In 1957 he was with the Hamilton Tiger Cats. 
The score was 25-25. 
The Argo's star kicker, Dave Mann, was going for the winning single point. 
What happened next has been called the greatest moment in sport. 
Mann's kick only went 10 yards into the end zone. 
Faloney kicked the ball back. 
Mr. Faloney snared the pigskin just to the right of the post. 
In 1963, the Grey Cup was perhaps Faloney's greatest playoff performance. 
We had much in common, except for hunting foxes. 
Men who try to intervene are killed on the spot.  
Rape can be a very effective means of destroying communities, both physically and emotionally. 
As one refugee explained: 
Rape victims describe themselves as dead to their families. 
Others fear being divorced or excluded from their communities. 
As one rape victim put it: 
At that moment I thought God doesn't exist. 
I wanted to kill myself.  
Myths of Multiculturalism Policy 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
This country is undergoing great change in the composition of its population. 
Their presence in Canada enriched the cultural mosaic of our country.  
The policy objectives set out in the act are decidedly proactive. 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Wednesday, June 16, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Government Policy on China 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Absence of Government Leader 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
However, I will take as notice any questions that honourable senators might wish to ask.  
Miscellaneous Statute Law Amendment Bill, 1999 
Public Sector Pension Investment Board Bill 
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment-Vote Deferred 
That is what is meant by a defined benefit plan. 
The benefit to an employee is, in fact, defined by a mathematical formula.  
If it did, a different set of rules would apply.  
That position is not unique to this case. 
What should be the role of the board? 
What should be its governance structure? 
Those are important questions. 
Historically, the so-called fund was in large measure a notional fund. 
Those negotiations ultimately fell apart. 
Similarly, future surpluses would be shared.  
There were two different criticisms of this particular provision. 
The committee again had a considerable amount of sympathy with that point of view. 
Therefore, honourable senators, we believe that the government has the right to the surplus.  
They are attached to yesterday's Journals of the Senate . 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
The honourable senator said that this is a first step. 
It took the Nisga'a 122 years to arrive at their agreement. 
What guarantees are there that people will be treated fairly? 
The honourable senator seems to want the world to trust the government. 
On what basis does he want this trust factor to go forward?  
If this change is not in the bill, it will clearly be challenged. 
The particular section on same-sex benefits is required in any event.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, the honourable senator has referred to a court case. 
Can the senator tell us whether, in that decision, the phrase "conjugal partner" is used?  
I am not sure whether that is the exact phrase. 
I would have to check. 
What do the words "conjugal partner" mean in this report?  
What do you mean by that?  
The answer to the question is "yes."  
Therefore, you would accept an amendment to the report to delete that term?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That should have been done yesterday, honourable senators.  
Why would I do it yesterday? 
It has just been presented here.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
That document was very interesting. 
Some people live with their mother and they take care of each other. 
Others live with their brothers and they take good care of each other. 
I am not concerned about myself. 
I raised this matter in the area of Montreal that I used to represent. 
I conducted a poll on one street in that area, which is highly populated. 
That means that I am speaking to myself. 
I make mistakes in English, but I do not care. 
I do not correct my speeches.  
I wish to ask the honourable senator the following, namely, does that require court action? 
Is that the route that must be taken? 
I live in an old district of Montreal. 
I have no answer for them.  
Can you kindly help me out in our reflection here today? 
I do not know that I can give you more. 
Your example is a wonderful one. 
We had some examples before the committee of exactly the same thing.  
Honourable senators, my supplementary question is directed to the honourable senator. 
He paraphrases what the Supreme Court has decided. 
Supremacy resides in this place and in the other place. 
Honourable senators, I have answered this question about four times. 
The committee has said that. 
We have recognized the issue.  
The committee clearly recognizes that there is a problem. 
Clearly, the notion of further exploration and discussion of that issue is warranted. 
That is exactly why we put it in the report. 
What more do you expect of us?  
That is not something one can do overnight. 
That is a complex problem. 
It is also an expensive problem. 
We do recognize the problem. 
We have said that people ought to deal with it. 
I do not know what more the honourable senator expects of us.  
I would have preferred amendments to the proposed legislation. 
I know that the expansion of the definition is an expensive path to follow. 
That is a legitimate point with which the committee obviously did not agree.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
It shows how well this place can do a job. 
The report, however, cries out for at least one amendment. 
I am surprised that the committee did not go further. 
I am speaking about the joint pension management board. 
He also indicated that discussions would take place as soon as possible.  
That is a very reasonable question. 
That was the reason for the negotiation. 
Therefore, we were not prepared to proceed in that fashion.  
Nevertheless, we seriously discussed the question of whether that amendment was desirable.  
They have been somewhat secondary to the discussion. 
However, they are still directly affected.  
The committee intends to pursue this issue vigorously in the fall. 
We made that clear in the report. 
We have made that clear to the minister.  
I see no urgency to pass this bill. 
There may be some but I have not found it. 
Again, honourable senators, that is a very good question. 
Let me try to respond. 
Honourable senators, let us forget about the past and talk about the future. 
I do not see the advantage for them of switching over. 
That is certainly what the law says. 
It is not the same at all.  
The bill is entitled: 
An Act to establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board.  
In French, it reads: "L'Office d'investissement des regimes de pension."  
Does that imply that there is only one fund or many?  
There are currently many plans but only one fund. 
Up until now, they have not been kept in a separate fund. 
That is the intent.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I have two questions. 
I would be grateful if the honourable senator would clarify them for me.  
My second question relates to corporate governance. 
So those court cases would not be foreclosed by this?  
In some cases the concern has been about the future of their plan. 
In the hearings, was the committee able to assuage some of that concern? 
With respect to the question of the surplus, did you come any closer to agreement?  
Honourable senators, I do not know if we were able to assuage the concerns. 
The fact of the matter is that they are under a defined benefit plan. 
We tried to meet their concerns, or at least to assuage them. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The important words are "relationship of a conjugal nature."  
It fails to legislate adequate treatment for homosexual persons. 
It fails to protect the institution of marriage. 
We have a duty to do so. 
The courts are not the proper fora for these decisions. 
Mr. Chairman, and honourable senators, I am gravely concerned by what I see. 
What is needed is leadership. 
I say that with great respect. 
He referred to the years of litigation.  
I called it the "double-spouse clause."  
The court has said that it will take a similar approach. 
We now have Bill C-78 before us. 
This concept of marriage must no longer be diminished and undermined. 
I shall return to the words "mutual society, help, and comfort" later.  
The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines conjugal as: 
Every act of sex is not a conjugal act. 
Neither is every sexual bed a conjugal bed. 
Nor is every act of sex a relationship. 
For centuries, the weight of jurisprudence and law has supported this.  
This concept of marriage has been arbitrarily eroded by certain judicial activists in our courts. 
The issue of judicial activism is a social issue in Canada. 
The issue is pension benefits. 
That is the heart of the question.  
Sex does not a relationship make. 
Sex does not a commitment make. 
Sex does not an obligation make.  
Would the honourable senator entertain a question?  
I had asked the chair of the committee for his definition of that phrase. 
Does she think it should be deleted from the report?  
I thank the Honourable Senator Kinsella for his question.  
I shall speak to the substantive issues, though.  
The bill does not say "conjugal partners." 
It does not say "conjugal relationship." 
Bill C-78 says clearly "a relationship of a conjugal nature."  
The real question hovers around what I have said in my speech. 
First, the debate has never really unfolded in this chamber. 
The real issue revolves around the definition of the word "conjugal." 
Some people will say, "That is fine; leave it to the courts." 
That is always an unsatisfactory response. 
I remember some of the initiatives that he has taken. 
It is a form of terrorism. 
As a black person, I know much about "isms." 
Had I been a member of that committee, I would have paid much more attention. 
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
We pursued those companies in court to make them put the money back.  
There was a classic example here in Canada recently. 
The court ordered him to put it back. 
It had lots of assets in buildings and lands, et cetera. 
The new owner took that money as a matter of right.  
On their face, these appear to be very justified complaints. 
And if their husbands got killed in the line of duty? 
This is just an act of cruelty," Clark says. 
"There is a great disparity and injustice here."  
"Voluntary" withdrawals forfeited all accrued interest. 
There are many other examples. 
The Honourable Senator Frank Mahovlich will be aware of this. 
Where did the management's money come from? 
It came from paying the players smaller salaries.  
They took it to court. 
I sat on the board when the matter came before us. 
They finally achieved some equity in their pensions.  
I see no difference between that case and this. 
Here, there a $30-billion surplus. 
I do not know how the Liberal government can consider taking this. 
Who is the business agent for the military? 
The general in charge? 
Who is the business agent for RCMP? 
Who will represent the people whose money this is?  
It could just be transferred internally. 
The government does not have a right to it.  
Then, if there is a surplus, it can be dealt with beyond that.  
The surplus should never leave the fund. 
A surplus in the fund would help to alleviate any potential deficit situation.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Clause 25(4) on page 51 of the bill reads: 
"Conjugal" is not defined in the bill. 
We are referred to the courts.  
The Supreme Court said that characteristic of conjugal relationship include the following: 
The answer is far from clear.  
I suppose a receipt from your Viagra dealer. 
In Hawaii, they have found a solution. 
They have found a system that seems to work well. 
Unmarried citizens are free to name what they call "reciprocal beneficiaries." 
Two political areas in the world have circumvented this problem.  
That sounds like a lot of money. 
However, honourable senators, the present pension plan has $130 billion in it. 
Honourable senators, the debate on Bill C-78 has been full. 
Much has been said about the various issues. 
We must indicate where we on this side of the chamber are coming from.  
The problems with this bill are many. 
First, there is the matter of the surplus. 
Why should the government be any different? 
Second, there is the issue of future surpluses. 
Let us look ahead. 
I hope the government is listening.  
They could not get information like that. 
Fifth, this board can hire and fire its own auditor. 
To think this was cooked up by Treasury Board. 
Eighth, there is the matter of Canada Post. 
It must set up its own plan. 
Is there not a moral issue here as well?  
Tenth, there is the lack of a review mechanism. 
The testimony before the committee was far from conclusive. 
Different lawyers and different experts told us different things. 
We could say, "Live up to your commitment, Mr. Minister. 
You said you would. 
Let us see you put it into practice."  
If a joint board were negotiated, a new bill would be needed in any event. 
Therefore, honourable senators, I move, seconded by Senator Lynch-Staunton: 
That the Committee report back to the Senate no later than September 7, 1999. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Would those honourable senators in favour of the amendment please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Would those honourable senators opposed to the amendment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen .  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Twelfth Report of Committee Presented 
Leave having been given to revert to Reports of Committees: 
Wednesday, June 16, 1999 
On Thursday, June 10, 1999 the Senate adopted the following motion: 
On Wednesday, June 16, 1999, your committee heard from Senator Murray, P.C. 
However, as an interim measure, your committee makes the following recommendation: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Canadian District of Moravian Church of America-Second Reading 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators, I make no comment on the bill. 
Now all matrimonial matters are dealt with by the courts, and not through Parliament.  
It is time we addressed this anachronism in our law. 
I hope all members in this place would support such a bill.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am very glad that it is finally moving along.  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Sixth Report of Standing Joint Committee Adopted 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Honourable senators, I move adoption of this report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Privatization and Licensing of Quotas 
Report of Fisheries Committee Adopted 
Many witnesses spoke of this.  
Honourable senators, I move adoption of this report, seconded by the Honourable Senator Butts. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Canada's political leadership is extremely quiet on the issue of official languages. 
This most sensitive issue was discussed at length. 
Since then, Canadian leadership has evaporated. 
There is no longer any leadership in Canada.  
I must also mention the situation of Canadians who are members of a linguistic minority. 
Educational rights are guaranteed. 
The issue of anglophone Quebecers living in a minority must be taken into consideration.  
The rate of assimilation of French Canadians is horrendous. 
It can reach 60 per cent in some regions. 
This is of grave concern. 
They need the support of Canada's leaders.  
The federal government has failed to meet some of its responsibilities. 
The Official Languages Act recognizes linguistic equality in government services. 
Section VII of the Official Languages Act is very important. 
These reports are extremely disappointing. 
They are written in haste. 
This is one of the tragic realities faced by francophone minorities outside of Quebec. 
The reason this is all we get is very simple. 
We have all had experience of life in politics and in public administration. 
The Commissioner of Official Languages keeps saying it, but the departments' responsibilities are diffuse. 
There is only one real solution. 
If he is unable, let him assume the responsibility himself. 
In professional terms, the people do their work, I have no problem with that.  
There is talk of the cabinet shuffle coming perhaps in the fall. 
We are witnessing an extremely dangerous slippage affecting French life in Canada. 
Honourable senators, such correction requires a leadership that is simple, and which assumes its responsibilities.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
The francophone and anglophone communities in Quebec also have rights and protections under the Constitution. 
Quebec has nothing to do with that.  
That being said, we appreciate the honourable senator's support. 
I think he is right about a lot of issues. 
Senator Rivest is right. 
It is a question of semantics.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I would have a comment - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
We must ask for leave to extend the debate then, because the time is up. 
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Senator Simard has covered the subject well. 
Our colleagues Senators Gauthier, Rivest and Corbin have made their point eloquently. 
They are disappearing in Western Canada. 
They are pleading for help. 
I know them well. 
When I was young, I campaigned for Senator Robichaud. 
He may not remember. 
It was in the days of Jean Lesage. 
I see him smiling and nodding his head. 
I like to see him smile when I am speaking. 
You know that I helped you in 1960. 
I supported your efforts to have Acadians recognized. 
Recognizing someone never means taking someone else's rights away. 
Recognition is an affirmation of what we are.  
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
National Council of Welfare 
Report on Preschool Children-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Promises to Keep"-( Honourable Senator Pepin ). 
We organized the first national conference on daycare. 
We submitted a very detailed report. 
The reality is that those additional spaces are needed now more than ever before.  
"We cannot afford it," policy-makers say.  
It is as simple as that. 
Poverty plays a particularly insidious role in the development of young children. 
What do researchers suggest? 
Accessible, affordable, quality daycare. 
Honourable senators, what can we do? 
Yet that is exactly what we are asking them to do. 
Honourable senators, studies been carried out. 
We have the information. 
We must now act. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
She gave an excellent speech. 
I was a member in the other place with her from 1984 to 1988. 
Senator Pepin asks us to join her. 
She is asking for our support. 
I am ready to help. 
I see Senators DeWare and Gill. 
We are a diminishing group at quarter to five. 
I wanted to stay because I expected her to speak.  
For my part, I support her.  
For the last week, I have let nothing pass. 
I do not see where we disagree.  
We need leaders in this area. 
Senator Prud'homme is hired. 
I urge you to bring pressure to bear.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
The time provided for this item has expired.  
Honourable senators, I see that everyone is wondering who will move the adjournment. 
On motion of Senator Losier-Cool, debate adjourned.  
Status of Palliative Care 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, before addressing this issue, I would like to apologize. 
Palliative care concerns itself with the total person, not simply the illness. 
It is a highly specialized area of medicine which is continuing to advance.  
Therefore, I will not debate that aspect of it here and again. 
I will of course utter a word of caution:
It is to be hoped that that exercise is now behind us.  
The time has finally come to deal with the proper care of terminally ill people. 
In 1989, 2.9 million Canadians were over the age of 65. 
By the year 2011, this number will have increased to 5 million. 
The longevity span is constantly increasing, and with it, debilitating terminal illnesses. 
It is to be hoped that they are now awakening to reality. 
Death, after all, is our common lot.  
Palliative care is still on the back burner in many medical schools. 
We know why it is required. 
I understand that palliative care requires further research. 
Compared to other jurisdictions, Canada is lagging behind. 
In my opinion, there has been sufficient talk about the need for palliative care. 
Now is the time for action.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
Status of Education and Health in Young Girls and Women-Inquiry 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
Senator Andreychuk raised the matter of maternity and mortality. 
What caused this failure? 
There is a lack of support on the part of signatory governments. 
According to Senator Corbin, the elimination of this practice remains a priority for CIDA.  
This practice would certainly be questioned if people were better informed about its harmful effects.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Health Care in Canada 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
It is an important factor in our productivity relative to other nations.  
For others, it can be a matter of life and death.  
However, that security is being threatened. 
We, as legislators, must also do the same.  
...to lay the groundwork for a clear, sustained focus on health care reform.  
The Liberals cut $6 billion from that total. 
To appreciate how this translates at the provincial level, let us look at New Brunswick. 
...as a starting point for initiating an inquiry into the health care system.  
Like the rest of us, Senator Keon certainly does not have all the answers. 
A vision provides the blueprint for future change and progress. 
We must know what we want in health care. 
Honourable senators, when you have a vision, you have a basis from which to work. 
As a result, when the decisions are made, they will contribute towards building a system. 
It does not mean simply trying to manage to get by day-to-day. 
It is not about crisis management.  
Not having a vision means drifting from one crisis to the next. 
It means cutting one program and having greatly increased costs show up in another program. 
The consequences of a lack of vision can be nothing short of disastrous. 
Honourable senators, New Brunswick is a case in point. 
We are not just talking about family doctors. 
Another example in New Brunswick involves the prescription drug program. 
Therefore, our medical needs are changing and they need to be addressed. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Motion for Production of Documents Relevant to Proposed Privatization-Debate Continued 
( d ) minutes of departmental, inter-departmental and other meetings; and 
Honourable Senator Murray, P.C. ) 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, this motion has reached the fifteenth day. 
Hansard for February 11 gives the details of that motion. 
Senator Graham then spoke. 
For example, on page 290, Professor Savoie writes: 
The thesis of his book is that power has gone to the centre. 
He drew our attention to references in Beauchesne on this subject. 
I shall not delve into that subject at this time. 
I should like to pursue them further.  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Honourable senators, is it possible to ask a question?  
Could the honourable senator indicate Mr. Savoie's level of appreciation of our institution?  
Cabinet is not a decision-making body. 
Rather, it is a kind of focus group for the prime minister.  
I read that line in a few newspaper articles when the book was published.  
Does Mr. Savoie also refer to the Senate in his book?  
That is not intended to be a quote.  
Mr. Savoie does refer to the Senate in his book. 
On pages 263 and 264, he speaks of appointments to the Senate. 
On page 77, 107 and 108, the reference is to the Australian Senate. 
Ministerial appointments in the Senate are spoken of on pages 82 and 83. 
The role of the Senate is addressed on page 48. 
My assessment of the book is that it was an interesting thesis. 
I would not attempt to provide a precis as to his view on the Senate.  
One last question, if I may. 
From time to time, he has referred to our institution as "Heaven."  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Senator Kinsella referred to this concentration of power as having taken place in recent years. 
I heard that said as having happened under the Trudeau government. 
I heard it said again with regard to the Mulroney government. 
I see heads nodding, but that is not on the record.  
Honourable senators, I am not sure whether that is his thesis or not. 
It certainly would not be mine.  
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Recent Decision of Supreme Court of Canada-Inquiry-Order Stands 
( f ) to the nationwide, extensive commentary and public discussion on the matter; and 
I would therefore like the order to stand in my name.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow, at 2 p.m.
