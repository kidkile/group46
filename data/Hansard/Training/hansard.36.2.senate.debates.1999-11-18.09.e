The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Honourable John B. Stewart 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
He was re-elected in 1963 and 1965. 
Who would have enough influence and credibility - indeed, the courage - to make the call?  
And the rest, as they say, is history.  
As I recall, Frank was the third star that night. 
Every class was a sellout.  
He or she can never tell where that influence stops. 
They might have turned out!  
The privileges of Parliament are the privileges of the people. 
The rights of Parliament are the rights of the people.  
On occasion in debate, he has purported to evaluate my performance. 
I have never received anything better than a gentleman's C in those evaluations.  
This is a scholar who found his way into politics. 
Let me say a word about the 1962 election. 
Nevertheless, it was a considerable victory for Dr. Stewart. 
No grievance was unimportant, especially when the Tories were in power.  
Is this scholar a partisan? 
Let me put it this way. 
Honourable senators, I have not read these books. 
One cannot be too prudent in matters of this kind. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do I understand you, Honourable Senator Murray, to be making a motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That is truly an honour. 
I now know where they came from. 
Senator Stewart has played a remarkable role here. 
I, too, should like to make reference to one of his books. 
The unsung heroes of the House are the party house leaders. 
Each must have a dual loyalty: to his party and to the House. 
At times they ignore the House. 
Listen well, Senator Boudreau. 
If only we were all prepared to hear him. 
I hear you now, Senator Stewart.  
Senator Stewart, throughout his time here, has been a great leader. 
In particular, he served on the Foreign Affairs Committee with distinction. 
Other things, however, make us different. 
I still have a vivid memory of our inquiry on the Royal Recommendation. 
He has published two books on Hume's writings. 
Sometimes I think of him as a neo-Scottish Montesquieu. 
Let us come back to David Hume. 
One of his critics, Douglas Long, has written: 
Senator Stewart never leans toward exaggeration or grandiloquence. 
This politician, professor and author has brought honour to this institution. 
We will miss his ideas and his action, as well as his good advice.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Next week, we will be paying tribute to Senator Derek Lewis, also from Atlantic Canada. 
We wish him well in his retirement.  
It is a suburb of Guysborough.  
Senator Stewart is an academic, an author, and a student of Parliament. 
Senator Stewart took his responsibilities very seriously.  
Senator Stewart provided that expertise with wisdom and judgment. 
This may turn out to be a banner day for Senator Stewart. 
Senator Murray has offered him an office in perpetuity. 
Senator Stewart has had a tremendous effect on many of us in this chamber. 
I thought I had truly made it. 
Nonetheless, it was great fun during that period of time. 
I enjoyed it immensely. 
When it was over, I went back to my usual work in the Senate. 
However, there is still hope.  
He decried all of those who talk only about the "problems of peace." 
Personally, I am enormously sad to see him leave. 
He has been a good friend for a long time. 
I could not have done the job without it. 
John, keep on speaking and keep on writing. 
My husband, Mike, shall miss you, and so shall Bessie.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
However, there are a few thoughts that I should like to put on the record. 
We must try to find some common ground on behalf of the national interest.  
We were not an easy bunch to deal with. 
We all came with our vested opinions. 
The comment was said in less than complimentary terms. 
He had a way of bringing us into line from time to time. 
As Senator Bolduc has said, our reports speak for themselves. 
I thank you for the things that you have taught us. 
However, I certainly share their point of view. 
I trust that Senator Stewart will continue to watch our work. 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
I did not know Senator Stewart before 1984 when he came to the Senate. 
Someone referred to Senator Stewart's regard for house leaders. 
We have forgotten that since 1984 there have been majority Parliaments. 
I also was elected in two minority Parliaments. 
In that atmosphere, one appreciates the responsibility of the house leader.  
Honourable senators, Senator Stewart is a great teacher. 
People who knew him before I did have told us that. 
He has taught us how public business should be treated. 
He has high standards and values. 
When one come across someone like Senator Stewart, it is such a refreshing experience. 
He may be a political scientist, but he is also a philosopher. 
It is not by accident that one of his great loves is David Hume. 
He shares values himself with David Hume.  
Our challenge now is to maintain that standard.  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
That was the first time I had voted in a federal election. 
He was always willing to share his wise counsel with all of us.  
You have been a great teacher.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
It was that day when I met Senator John Stewart. 
You can say the bunch of us came together.  
Senator Stewart, I have read some of your books. 
The one that I read most recently was your most recent book on David Hume. 
Senator Stewart and I served on a few committees together. 
It is from the Epistle to the Philippians, chapter 4, verse 8: 
Senator Stewart, I wish you well in your retirement. 
I am anticipating your next book on David Hume. 
You leave this place with great respect, great love and great affection.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I say that for one reason. 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
I have only a few words to add.  
Senator John Stewart has very strong connections to Prince Edward Island. 
Senator Stewart, I extend my best wishes to you on your retirement from this place.  
My three colleagues Senators Bacon, Ferretti Barth and Maheu, were seated at my table. 
They looked over at Senator Stewart from time to time. 
I asked them why they were looking at him. 
I am therefore unable to speak on the subject.  
You have yet to say the best things about this man. 
What you are saying makes no sense. 
I have known him for three years. 
It will be difficult to get down to business again, later. 
We are being nostalgic. 
The fine speeches come to an end, and we move on with Question Period. 
We could do the same thing in the Senate. 
Do not forget, Senator Stewart, to move adjournment.  
I was going to forget the extraordinary things that fascinate me. 
As a senator, he has helped establish the Senate's impeccable reputation. 
He has marked the Senate, as others will do in the future. 
That is a wonderful motto to live by.  
His insight and wisdom will be missed. 
I wish you all the best.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
I did not know how to respond. 
My chances of winning were very small. 
Finally, I yielded to temptation. 
As it turned out, I was elected with a majority of 113. 
Then I managed to get re-elected in 1963 and 1965. 
Consequently, I went carpetbagging down to Southwest Nova.  
Allan MacEachen was the only Liberal elected in our province. 
What did I learn in the House of Commons? 
Second, I learned something about the economic problems of Western Canada. 
In January 1984, I was summoned to the Senate. 
What did I learn here? 
First, I gained a new respect for this house. 
Second, I learned that the Senate can do important legislative work. 
Consequently, the Senate can complement the work of the House of Commons. 
Third, I learned the value of our committee work.  
I trust that our European report will bring on a debate here.  
The same is true for the Fisheries Committee, as chaired by Senator Comeau.  
There are many others to thank. 
No task was ever beyond her zeal or ability. 
I am glad to see her and her husband in the gallery this afternoon.  
David Murphy has been my researcher. 
The relationship between these two writers is direct and close. 
Smith built directly upon the foundation laid down by his slightly older predecessor.  
Three clerks have served the committee in recent years. 
I refer to Serge Pelletier, Line Gravel, and Till Heyde. 
Both here and abroad, they were our faithful and skillful pilots.  
Reference was made by Senator Fairbairn to Bessie. 
Both retrospectively and prospectively, I thank you for all your kind words.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
I am deeply honoured and touched. 
To Senator Stewart I say, "Bonne chance."  
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
The program will be assessed and evaluated in June, 2000.  
Congratulations on Election as Member of Parliament for Mount Royal 
He is not interested in himself.  
These people owe a part of their freedom to him. 
He defended these men without any thought of money or publicity.  
Honourable senators, I think he has mastered that philosophy quite well.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is there leave, honourable senators, for the honourable senator to continue her speech?  
I thank honourable senators.  
Professor Irwin Cotler has made a profound mark in the world of human rights. 
With these remarks, honourable senators, I welcome Mr. Cotler to the other place. 
First Report of Committee Tabled 
Hon. Leo E. Kolber :
( For text of report see today's Journals of the Senate.)  
First Report of Special Committee Tabled 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
( For text of report see today's Journals of the Senate.)  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Permit Electronic Coverage 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Engage Services 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, November 23, 1999, I will move: 
In particular, the Committee shall be authorized to examine: 
2. Developments in Canada respecting the issues dealt with in the report; 
3. Developments in foreign jurisdictions respecting the issues dealt with in the report; and 
That the Committee submit its final report no later than June 6, 2000.  
Hon. Leo E. Kolber :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, November 23, 1999, I will move: 
That the Committee submit its final report no later than December 31, 2000.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sittings of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honorable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Standing Joint Committee Authorized to Meet During Sittings of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Honourable the Speaker pro tempore is a member of that committee. 
Therefore, I wish to move the following motion in her place.  
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House thereof.  
Thus, there is the request that this motion be dealt with now. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is being taken very seriously. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I shall raise that issue with the minister to determine the current state of affairs. 
This is not an open court and it is not a transparent procedure. 
People in Canada know nothing about it. 
This is a matter of great public interest. 
That is why I raise the question here. 
This is a huge case.  
Government Policy on Defending Against Suits by Corporations 
Surely, that could be made public. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I am unaware of precisely what their course of action will be. 
It would be unwise to indicate that position at this time.  
The federal government has received cooperation from the provinces in those areas. 
The government remains committed to that defence.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise to ensure certainty in our procedures. 
Senator Hays gave notice of a motion on behalf of the Speaker pro tempore . 
I should think the same applies for the Speaker pro tempore .  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I appreciate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raising this matter. 
I would have to examine the record to see exactly what I said. 
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, electronic commerce is a subject upon which I have a profound interest. 
Canada is a world leader in information technology. 
This legislation is long overdue and urgently required.  
The Canadian Dental Association informed me that this bill: 
The Canadian Bar Association also has concerns about Bill C-6. 
The Senate committee must do some substantial repair work to clarify this conundrum.  
The luxury of time is gone. 
This situation has become a subject of personal conflict for him. 
Bill C-6 will not assist in achieving these goals.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Keon, debate adjourned.  
Bill to amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
This new legislation was the second stage of the government's initiative. 
The structure of our society, and of our law, requires consistency. 
All are equal before the law. 
Everyone has the same rights, but also the same obligations. 
The answer to both questions was no.  
However, these provisions have been adapted to the context of the military justice system.  
The list is divided in two types of offences: primary and secondary.  
In the case of secondary designated offences, the taking of samples is not compulsory. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Medical Decisions Facilitation Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Honourable Senator Lavoie-Roux ) 
I bring a deep conviction of the inherent dignity and value of the human person. 
Sickness, suffering and dying are an inevitable part of human experience. 
Honourable senators, here is the dilemma we face as legislators. 
In my view, the bill should go forward. 
This issue requires further probing and thought. 
However, we must not open the door to the direct practice of euthanasia. 
I call on the Senate to be diligent in this matter.  
It is morally unacceptable.  
Let us strengthen this growing need in Canada.  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
I had indicated that I would yield to Senator Oliver.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, shall we stand this matter in the name of Senator Oliver? 
I wish to move the adjournment, then, in his name.  
Someone has to do something with this matter or else it will collapse.  
Put it in your name, then.  
Senator Cools wishes to stand the matter.  
Hon. Joan Fraser , pursuant to notice of November 17, 1999, moved: 
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, November 23, 1999, at 2:00 p.m.
