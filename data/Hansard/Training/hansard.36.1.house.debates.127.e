Division on amendment deferred 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 127 
Monday, September 28, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Unfortunately I have to report that I think that is the case today.  
I think that is somewhat hypocritical. 
That is what I find objectionable. 
We have some serious problems with that.  
It begs the question of why this taxpayer money is being spent. 
Why are we not being apprised of the situation?  
It boils down to a few reasons. 
That was decided in court by Judge Rothstein. 
I will get into the quotes in a minute. 
That is exactly the same question we raise today. 
The taxpayers have paid for them. 
It is only fair to give taxpayers access to the documents.  
Basically that is what this motion asks today.  
He thought that disclosing public opinion surveys was indeed important.  
It is not as though this is a cheap endeavour. 
It is not as though these are piddly sums of money. 
More than that, it is also a case of money. 
It is important that we include some precedents in this debate. 
That is a lot of polling. 
We know it has had some determinations on it. 
Certainly it has done polling. 
It has told me that it has done polling. 
It should be forthright and release these documents.  
With secrecy like this it is very difficult for them to do their job. 
This points to the ideas in government circles on something like this. 
Who are those enemies? 
Is it the official opposition? 
I do not think so. 
We have the best interest of Canada at heart, as does the government. 
We are not an enemy of the state. 
The documents should be made available.  
Some may be backbenchers. 
As a result they should be following through on that. 
They should be ringing true some of those words and making good on that pledge. 
Where are the credible standards of political behaviour? 
It touches on the whole controversy of the use of pepper spray at APEC. 
Today we want some clarity. 
Today we want some frankness. 
They have all told me that they have the documents. 
Certainly the Calgary declaration falls within the mould.  
The taxpayers have paid for these polls. 
They have paid for these surveys. 
They deserve to have access to these things. 
In order to do its job the official opposition deserves access to them. 
It should be able to do its job. 
We have nothing new under the sun. 
They should come forward with these things.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
This government has nothing to hide. 
The consultation process surrounding the Calgary Declaration was a transparent one. 
It highlights our country's diversity. 
In a word, our government has showed leadership.  
Leadership can take many forms. 
It must be reflected in all spheres of our life as a nation. 
Our leadership and actions have created a climate favourable to Canadian unity. 
That was a challenge that many people thought could not be overcome. 
Instead, it pervades each of these spheres. 
Canadians may not fully realize this. 
I would like to illustrate this with figures. 
It is more than a mere accounting operation. 
Canada is much more than that. 
In conclusion I simply say that the government intends to comply. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
That document may be one of Canada's best kept secrets. 
They keep it in a drawer somewhere. 
We wanted to look at the issue more thoroughly. 
The first finding was that no one knew about the Calgary Declaration. 
People were asked what they knew about the Calgary Declaration. 
However, it generates very little interest on the streets.  
I now come to the first question in our poll. 
They were asked ``Have there been any proposals?'', 
One person in four, therefore, thought there had been some sort of offer. 
It gets even sadder when the Calgary Declaration is mentioned. 
And now they tell us that a large number of people support the declaration. 
They would have to know what it was about.  
Nobody knows what it is about. 
This is a initiative that never got off the ground; nobody talks about it.  
We will now see whether they are as optimistic as our Liberal friends. 
I could go on. 
Several questions were asked and the poll results were made public at the time.  
There was another question. 
``Do you feel like you have been consulted on the Calgary Declaration?'' 
The last two categories add up to a total of 96%.  
I must remind members how this consultation process took place. 
In some instances, it was done at little publicized public meetings. 
Some of it was done through the Internet. 
Some of it was done though toll-free lines. 
What is the attitude of this government, starting with the Prime Minister? 
That is the tactic they used. 
It is a message. 
We have not forgotten and others will not forget either.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
We are all doing our best.  
Constitutional law is a dialectical process. 
I think this is true.  
Then the positive law must be applied in the same way. 
We can change a constitution by formal amendments. 
We can change it by practice. 
Constitutions are living treaties and they are intended to evolve.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Do not worry, our priorities are elsewhere. 
Such is my perception. 
Of course our party is in favour of that. 
It has often been said that what goes around comes around. 
They say ``We want the documentation relating to the Calgary declaration''. 
Let them get it, read it over and over, go into it in detail. 
They are out of touch with reality with this.  
The Reform Party's intentions seem questionable to me. 
Reformers survive because of the splits between the various regions of the country. 
Reformers have absolutely no national agenda.  
If such is the objective, then let them continue down that road.  
These are the issues that people want us to tackle.  
It is wrong for the Reform Party to keep going against people's will. 
These issues are employment, economic development, the creation of new businesses- 
Mr. Andre Harvey: -and growing poverty. 
It is an outrage. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for Chicoutimi for his remarks.  
He does not want to cause dissent. 
Then I think he would get exactly what he wishes.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
And that it would allow us to consider the auditor general's recommendations.  
Bill C-53 contains no changes to the major program parameters. 
First, our analysis found that the program is fundamentally sound. 
It has proven itself for 37 years. 
Our research supports the soundness of the program's current structure. 
Second, this is not an appropriate time for grand experiments. 
Small and medium size businesses are an anchor for our national economy. 
In fact they make a crucial contribution to our collective economic well-being. 
This is one reason support for the bill before us is important.  
There are more than 2.5 million small businesses, including self-employed individuals across Canada. 
These account for 99% of all Canadian businesses. 
It is a sector of the economy that continues to grow. 
Farming operations and charitable and religious organizations are excluded from the current program. 
I will now outline for the House the key provisions contained in the bill.  
I am also proposing to replace the current sunset clause. 
This contingent liability would automatically be renewed every five years. 
The bill proposes the creation of two pilot projects designed to be financially self-sufficient. 
The voluntary sector plays an increasingly important role in Canada. 
This power is restrictive only. 
This is simply not the case. 
Lenders are lending money they raise themselves.  
In 1995 the government set the program on a cost recovery track. 
There are many factors that affect the performance of the program. 
Industry Canada will therefore continue to monitor the program very closely.  
Created in 1961, its overall record is one of great success. 
Some 9,000 of these firms were in rural communities. 
The success rate of the program is quite high. 
In the past this provision has created uncertainty about the future of the program. 
With over 13,000 points of service, this is no small task. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
What can be done? 
What is the role of government? 
In that regard the performance of the government is abysmal.  
We see it tinkering with yet another fundamentally flawed government program.  
How do we achieve this? 
What does the Liberal government do? 
It chooses winners over losers. 
Inevitably mistakes are made. 
The net effect to small business in Canada is a negative one.  
I do not know how it can justify its concept of these programs. 
Did the minister not read the report of the auditor general? 
It was a report that prompted him to change the name of the program. 
I am a perfect example of that. 
Prior to entering politics I had several businesses. 
I was more concerned with meeting the day to day demands of my business. 
So I agreed to it. 
I was forced to pay a premium on my interest rate charges. 
I was forced to pay registration fees. 
However, I would suggest just the opposite. 
It is good that he understands and recognizes the importance of small business. 
What about deregulating the banks? 
What about cutting taxes? 
This government has implemented 37 tax increases since it came to power. 
So it can fund all its programs like this.  
What is the answer? 
That may be true. 
The chair finds the amendment in order.  
Debate is on the amendment.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Studies have confirmed this.  
Loans are not all that is required for businesses to develop. 
He is calling it the Canada Small Business Financing Act. 
I think the title of the existing act is much more accurate. 
It is the Small Business Loans Act. 
This is one sort of loan. 
The effect will be quite the opposite, and that is the end of my digression.  
I hope the minister will deal with these issues.  
I agree that part of the regulations needed to be updated. 
Also, the bill authorizes the minister to launch pilot projects. 
In fact, the minister has already announced two such initiatives in very specific areas. 
That is the only piece of good news.  
Of course, the principle of self-financing is nowhere to be found in the bill. 
There will thus not be worries about the program coming to an end.  
We have questions, however, about the comprehensive review. 
I invite my Reform colleagues to examine this clause.  
I regret that the revision has been done merely from an accounting point of view. 
The government makes a big fuss about the knowledge economy. 
The knowledge economy needs a lot of capital. 
That is not nearly enough. 
It must serve this objective. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
They tend to be small businesses, small enterprises, young firms.  
Her partner runs a small contracting business in the city of Ottawa.  
The president of my federal executive is an interesting man. 
My last campaign chair was a retired manager of B.C. Tel. 
He runs a honey-producing business these days.  
The media chair was an individual who owns and manages a community newspaper. 
Fundraisers tended to have a relationship with business. 
One was a partner in a large law firm. 
One was the owner-manager of a health food store. 
The campaign advisers were interesting. 
He runs a private business as a financial adviser.  
One owns an electric contracting company. 
One runs a recreational vehicle outlet. 
One is an owner-operator of a hair salon. 
One person runs a tour company. 
One owns and runs a mining exploration company. 
They often referred to the frustration they have experienced with their bankers.  
These are the people who will actually create the jobs. 
The program has been accountable. 
Another area was the non-profit sector. 
Once it gets to committee obviously some of the fine tuning will take place.  
That is the sector dealing with women entrepreneurs. 
This is a terrible situation to accept. 
Another area is that of aboriginal business. 
Hopefully it will be in some other sectors.  
But that is the new reality.  
This is the way the world is. 
These are small businesses, often home based. 
They are not addressed adequately in this legislation. 
I see this as another shortcoming.  
There is also the equity issue of financing. 
When it comes to equity capital, parliament has to take this more seriously. 
There are many concerns about this legislation.  
These are small loans. 
There is a ceiling of $250,000 and hardly anybody uses that. 
Should we not visit that?  
Is this the best place to show support for those types of firms?  
These questions are more of the musing kind than critical comment. 
On balance, we support this program with some qualifications.  
There is the whole issue of aboriginal funding. 
We need to be reminded of these problems.  
In my judgment there is universal condemnation of this initiative. 
They are the people we know best. 
They are the people who should be receiving our support. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
By and large this duty has been discharged with commitment and diligence. 
This is the same rate that it has been since 1995. 
Lenders remain responsible for the remainder.  
A few other program parameters which have not changed should be noted. 
So what are we to do, ignore them? 
My party stands ready to assist with this. 
First, there is a mandatory program review provision. 
I say that for the following reasons. 
Parliamentary committees will be consulted for the implementation of such a pilot project. 
The other proposed pilot project deals with the voluntary sector. 
This program raises many questions. 
Contingent liabilities are a new addition to the act. 
Cost recovery is a worthy goal of the program. 
We have a heavily regulated financial services sector already. 
The next area I wish to address is that of the proposed accountability framework. 
This needs to be reviewed and for very good reasons. 
What would happen then? 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Small businesses are stressed under a burdening tax regime that makes us uncompetitive. 
The government should be reducing that. 
Also we are too highly taxed in this country . 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
He is stealing $5 billion this year''. 
How can he do that?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
We should be willing to take a risk and look after that industry too.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
And that the following Members be added to the list of Associate Members:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Particularly vulnerable to cyclical economic shifts are small and medium size businesses.  
However, manage and succeed they do. 
These businesses continue to be the fastest growing segment of the economy. 
Everyone who deals with the program knows where they stand.  
It being almost 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Obviously our education system is failing.  
Their work has not gone unnoticed.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Employment insurance is supposed to be part of our Canadian social safety net. 
It is their money.  
If this was in the private sector- 
Words such as ``theft'' and ``stealing'' should not be used in the House of Commons.  
CHIN WING CHUN TONG SOCIETY OF CANADA 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
This organization provides many programs for the Chinese community in Canada. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It is also independent of any government, political persuasion, or religious creed.  
CANADIAN BLOOD SERVICES AGENCY 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
In my judgment the following issues still need to be addressed.  
His accountability should be clear and precise.  
This would reduce donor demand and increase safety.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
She is one of the finest up and coming young athletes in Quebec. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
The people who live there genuinely seek to improve their communities.  
Co-operative housing is a unique form of housing. 
It is an important component in any comprehensive social housing policy. 
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
The legislation will soon be tabled in the house. 
Without this measure foreign publishers would enjoy significant advantages over Canadian publishers.  
The hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Canadian bureaucrats chaired those meetings. 
The seminar was sponsored by Canada. 
Once again Canadian bureaucrats participated. 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
We can never overemphasize their important contribution to the Canadian cultural identity.  
POLICE AND PEACE OFFICERS 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
This has been long overdue.  
This will formalize a tradition observed for over two decades. 
They have paid with their lives for their dedication to their communities. 
They and their families deserve our gratitude and recognition.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
The money will be distributed through CIDA.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Our rural areas have benefited from the presence of supply management. 
Consumers benefit from high quality products and stable, reasonable prices. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the people of Sherbrooke have spoken. 
We wish our new colleague, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, a warm welcome among us.  
Mr. Serge Cardin, for the electoral district of Sherbrooke.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is the law. 
Now we hear that the minister wants to change that law. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we can talk about choices any time. 
We are happy to do that. 
The law says that the minister must give that money back.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Is the government going to maintain a balanced approach? 
Are we going to reduce debt? 
Are we going to reduce personal income taxes? 
Are we going to reduce EI premiums? 
Are we going to invest in health care?  
That is the debate. 
I would suggest the Reform Party ought to begin to gauge it on that basis.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
This is a $6 billion a year tax grab.  
Why does the finance minister not just give the money back? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what is the debate the Reform Party is afraid of? 
Why will the Reform Party not debate the future of health care? 
Why will the Reform Party not deal with the real issues?  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance does not understand. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Is that his position?  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
We are talking about $6 billion here. 
That is a lot of money out of the pockets of Canadian workers and employers.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We ask the Reform Party- 
Colleagues, I appeal to you once again. 
I invite the hon. Minister of Finance to take the floor.  
Mr. Speaker, government is about choices. 
The government's choice is to proceed on a balanced approach.  
I ask members of the Reform Party if Canadians are entitled to know their position? 
Are they in favour of health care? 
Are they in favour of lower income taxes for Canadians? 
Are they in favour of reducing debt? 
That is the issue.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We intend to continue with a balanced approach. 
This means that we will invest in health. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois leader talks about morals. 
The total cost would be in excess of $25 billion. 
I wonder what planet these people live on.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the truth is that the latest statistics are shocking.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
How does the Prime Minister explain the contradiction?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no contradiction.  
Why does she not get up and apologize? 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
It is almost October and we have not seen it.  
There are only 2,300 of them.  
The hon. Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no gag committee. 
Let me simply say one thing. 
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
It appears to be leaning toward the second course of action.  
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I put the following question to the hon. member:
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
They do not have boats to sell.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Is he in favour- 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
By contrast, the Prime Minister's office has released one thin binder. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The instrument to do that is the PCC.  
It is its job to get to the truth and it will get there.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Last year we cut them by $1.5 billion.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, Bloc Quebecois):
That is what small and medium sized business wants.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
This is exactly the same thing that happened to Bruce Starlight.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The initial letter was written in 1995. 
So we are making progress. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is badly misinformed. 
Now it has happened again. 
She wrote the letter on August 24 of this year. 
Three weeks later she was threatened with a lawsuit. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me carry on with the clarification.  
In my ministry we have taken action to deal with confidential information. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
They want this disease to be eradicated.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We are very pleased with the results. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us see if we can clarify things a little more.  
Now opposition members are getting confused. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us really clarify this issue. 
That is about a month ago, not a long time ago.  
I ask the Minister of Health again. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this government believes that confidential information should be protected. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The government has essentially said that health care is important. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have already been very clear in the House. 
That priority will not change.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Last week we had Jesse James and Bonnie and Clyde. 
Today we have Genghis Khan. 
I am going to permit the hon. Minister of Finance to answer the question.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Is it Attila the Hun? 
Or is it other things which are equally unparliamentary?  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
He is doing a fine job. 
His analyses and advice are very important to me. 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
I realize that this issue concerns all Canadians.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Yes or no, please.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The government has not ignored the findings of these other commissions. 
It has taken them very seriously.  
I want to say that the commission is not a ``so-called independent commission''. 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
We all want answers.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank my colleague for her question.  
Today some 600 military personnel are involved in search and recovery efforts.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
We have asked questions about the Constitution and about the democratic rights of Albertans.  
The question is in order but that preamble is questionable.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The fact is that the Prime Minister is following the requirements of the Constitution. 
That is not democracy either in Alberta or anywhere else in our country.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Martin Cauchon: -of the economic spinoffs from these conventions.  
Yet, this project has not been submitted under the infrastructure program.  
I recognize the hon. opposition House leader. 
Is this on a point of order or a point of privilege?  
A privilege arising from question period.  
That is why I called it a point of order.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I know we are just coming back.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The point of order was brought up. 
I am going to go to the House leader of the opposition. 
MEMBER FOR SAINT-MAURICE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Could he answer that question now? 
Mr. Speaker, my charge was clear. 
It is the improper use of public funds.  
Mr. Speaker, I will continue with my statement. 
Do you instruct me to proceed?  
I want to hear what you have to say.  
I will now address why and how this House should take up this issue.  
Another similarity is that in both cases the evidence was conclusive.  
The article of August 5 says: ``Guess what folks? 
Accordingly, I believe this House must do three things.  
At this point at least, we do not know what the specific charge is.  
Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to move a motion. 
My colleague, I refer you to Beauchesne's 6th edition. 
I am seeking guidance as I go on with this. 
I refer to citation 50: 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I will not comment on that. 
I am sure those arrangements can be made at another time.  
I believe that is the second point he raised. 
In view of the imprecision, it has to be gleaned that way.  
The cost was correctly recorded as a contribution. 
We did this in order to be more prudent than was absolutely necessary.  
The allegations made by the member are incorrect.  
For the time being this matter is held in abeyance.  
Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
It is on this very issue.  
Then we are not going to address this right now. 
I will hear further argument after I have received the specific charge.  
One rule for them and one for us.  
I invite you to withdraw your final comments.  
Mr. Speaker, I am frustrated but I will withdraw it.  
I accept the withdrawal.

Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I know that is what he intends to do and not to read it.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Speaker, with respect, that is exactly where I was going.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
These petitions have been presented by the constituents of my riding of Calgary Centre.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Questions Nos. 78 and 79 will be answered today.

I am informed by the following Departments and Agencies as follows:

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Perhaps we could wrap up the points on the Order Paper first.  
Shall all questions be allowed to stand?  
The hon. member for Frontenac-Megantic.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
This motion was tabled on December 9, 1997. 
Does it have something to hide? 
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to what the member had to say. 
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Maybe the hon. parliamentary secretary could clear that up for me.  
This has been done. 
There has obviously been much improvement over time to this act. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
The bank gets a bank guarantee for 90% of the loan. 
In essence that is what this bill does.  
The member opposite also asks ``What are the changes? 
It requires that the applicant does the homework. 
It is very positive that the application is as detailed as it is.  
Many of the businesses will benefit from the changes in the bill. 
In 1998 the business directory in Mississauga listed just under 10,000 business. 
We did some analyses. 
They want to see us tackle the debt.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
In other words, taxpayers would guarantee the loan.  
The first example he gave was leasehold improvements.  
That is a perfect example of the problem with this government. 
The reason government members do not understand that is because they are career politicians. 
I would not be surprised if he was a lawyer.  
The member said that we found what the top three problems were. 
Notice that the member said ``we found''. 
He said that taxation was a problem. 
That seems to be an inconsistency to me.  
Why is the member part of a government that acts against small business?  
Mr. Speaker, some of those comments hardly merit a response. 
In any event, I found that comment to be somewhat irrelevant.  
The hon. member says that I do not know what I am talking about. 
The gentleman from the Reform Party says that is a liability?  
It is not a liability. 
Without leasehold improvements many small businesses would simply not be able to function.  
Why does the hon. member not support that?  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
I do not think any member of the House can ignore this point. 
The issue of risk should be examined more closely. 
Risk is a key element in the proper functioning of a free market. 
This is substantial when we consider the amount of money at stake.  
This is not an insignificant sum of money. 
Both my colleague from Saskatoon-Humboldt and I are small business operators. 
We both understand the difficulties small business owners face. 
This government just cannot seem to get the fundamentals right. 
Bill C-53 plays politics with the taxpayer's paycheque. 
There are two important questions. 
And why should the taxpayer take more risks than the banks?  
This clause addresses the minister's responsibility if a loan is not paid back. 
It is clear, however, that responsibility falls to the taxpayer.  
As a result, non-viable businesses will end up receiving funds.  
Under such an arrangement, the taxpayer is inevitably the loser. 
Government statistics support this thesis. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great intent to the member for Edmonton-Strathcona.  
The member seems to talk about a perfect world. 
They lend basically on current assets. 
This program addresses the concern for longer term assets, fixed assets. 
We talked about capital leases earlier. 
This is money that actually goes over a longer period of time.  
We have created taxpayers by assisting these businesses.  
The member seems to think the SBLA program is a subsidy. 
He talks about the program as if it is a subsidy. 
I would like him to comment on that.  
That can be done without government intervention as well. 
The hon. member also mentioned that it is not a perfect world. 
The taxpayers' money is unfortunately recycled.  
That is exactly what we want to do in the Reform Party. 
We would like to support small business. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, make no mistake in what the hon. member had to say. 
Small business loans work.  
We see ourselves as a partner. 
I would be interested in the hon. member's comments on this scenario. 
The banker sees an opportunity. 
Small independent business people will tell us that. 
I am also saying that. 
We need to address the issue of choice within the financial sector. 
That is the issue we are talking about.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I want to be very specific about an experience we had 10 years ago. 
At that time we were in opposition. 
I challenge him to stand up and say that in his own riding. 
His riding is no different from my riding. 
Each time we fine tuned it. 
We have been responsible with the fiscal framework. 
His words are so distant from reality. 
He can loose them in certain sectors. 
I appeal to him not to walk away from small business men and women. 
They are creating 80% of the jobs. 
There is a notion of letting banks do it on their own. 
I defy anybody to stand up and say this would happen. 
I will never waiver or walk away.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
They have breached their obligation to small business. 
How can they stand there and say how good they are being to small business? 
It is astonishing and it is dishonest.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
I have been advocating simplifying the tax system for the last few years. 
They do not understand how things get done in this Chamber. 
It is give and take. 
They say they are going to oppose. 
Bring it forward in a consistent, steady as she goes way. 
I pray that the Reform Party gets on to the game of comprehensive tax reform. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
It was interesting that the members opposite talked about the tax situation. 
I really question whether we could consider that an obstruction. 
They talk endlessly about a subsidy.  
I have practised in the small business area. 
I do not think anything could be further from the truth.  
The reality is 94% of these loans are effectively repaid under the terms and conditions. 
Why are banks not interested in taking those kinds of risks? 
I point out one obvious factor. 
They get it from the depositors of this country.  
That is the real issue we should be talking about. 
This has created many jobs in my riding. 
Some members talked about access to capital. 
The reality is that 85% of those loans are guaranteed. 
I note we have restricted our total liability to $1.5 billion. 
That is a lot of money. 
I think one member of the Reform Party mentioned that is not small change. 
It does not mean we will lose $1.5 billion. 
Some members said they wished there was more competition. 
What do they require? 
They require the technological equipment to make them efficient and productive in the business community. 
Often that is computer equipment.  
I am happy to say this legislation addresses that.  
That should not be unusual.  
Fortunately many other businesses stand in their place and continue to expand. 
These businesses pay taxes and create jobs. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to reply to the member for Calgary Centre.  
I understand the issue of payroll taxes. 
I am very heartened that we are actually moving in the right direction.  
The reality is Canada's payroll taxes are one of the lowest.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
No one is fooled by Bill C-53. 
The Liberals are ignoring small business.  
In terms of the Small Business Loans Act the auditor general has some concerns.  
There is a need to define the results expected from the SBLA program. 
Every conceivable need cannot be put under the umbrella of the SBLA.  
Similarly, the sales volume threshold is set too high. 
Loan officers should fully explain the opportunities and the costs of this form of financing. 
In the past the method of assessing the program has been a weakness. 
Tighter monitoring and program evaluation is a must. 
Solutions practical to small firms must be pursued with more vigour. 
At present the SBLA is not considering these needs.  
Financial institutions are coming up with new services and new products. 
Are these institutions able to take full advantage of the SBLA? 
The thresholds for financing are too high. 
In other words the CFIB has been asking for these changes for five years. 
What does the minister responsible for small business give us? 
Small businesses create jobs. 
Do the Liberals give interest free loans to small businesses? 
We know that the parameters of the program need to be constricted. 
The Liberals do not see the need to improve the program. 
Small businesses face a high tax burden. 
The government has placed tax increase after tax increase on Canadian businesses and individuals. 
We must not forget that individuals own small businesses.  
The Liberals are failing us in this regard. 
Lack of working capital is not covered in this bill. 
The department needs better tools to monitor the loan program. 
The department needs better forecasting techniques. 
The department is not reviewing risk analysis in this bill. 
The job creation record is very bad. 
The displacement effect is negative. 
A complete cost benefit analysis has never been done.  
The list is long but my time is up. 
Therefore we cannot support this bill.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Another party said that there are some improvements required in amendments. 
I might be wrong on that. 
I would like the member to clarify his position. 
So it will be very interesting when this bill goes to committee.  
I would like the member for Surrey Central to enlarge on his suggestions for improvements.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
We will support this bill once it is effective. 
Who would not support modernization and improvement to small businesses? 
The banks are using all kinds of practices to abuse the system. 
It is not the small businessman who is taking advantage of the system. 
This bill needs a lot of amendments. 
Let us create the tools. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I do not think members of the House have noted it.  
It will be financed entirely out of memberships.  
Happy Harry creates jobs. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
The title of this bill is a real mouthful in itself. 
It sounds like we are going to be all things to all people here.  
I do not believe this would be a formula for success right across the board. 
As I said, people naturally want to succeed. 
That is the direction that many small businesses like to see.  
The auditor general raised several of them in his spring report. 
Is the program not working? 
Pour money down that sinkhole.  
Capital gains taxes need to be at least minimized and at best eliminated. 
Employers need a flexible, well educated, motivated labour force. 
Workers obviously need to keep more of their money as well.  
We have the MacKay task force report to look at. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I certainly understand the challenges that small business faces today.  
The Liberal government does not understand that request. 
There are those who say that the banks are not doing it. 
Let them bring in some sort of risk-based lending for small business. 
They cannot do it through small business loans either. 
They have to have some sort of security to offer.  
Taxes eat into their opportunity to hire more employees. 
I am not just talking about the regular corporate taxes they pay. 
We were talking about taxes. 
That is perfectly clear. 
That is what the law says.  
It has come to our attention that he is going to change the law.  
We can draw the same comparison. 
That is what our finance minister is going to do. 
He is planning to change the law. 
Each time EI rises by 1% that is 40,000 jobs. 
Who would not want that? 
Let them continue to expand, be prosperous and hire people in this country.  
Is the House ready for the question.  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the bells having rung: 
These amendments would normally have been included in a regular omnibus bill. 
Many of the proposed changes to the legislation are the result of that process. 
Needless to say, this is a very old rule. 
Authors have traced it in English criminal law back to the middle ages.  
It has been criticized by lawyers and academics. 
After due consideration this government agrees that it should be repealed. 
The year and a day rule prevents this.  
The legislation proposes to simply repeal the time limit. 
This was always the case where victims died soon after the offence. 
We now propose to apply the same principle regardless of when the victim dies.  
The legislation provides for this. 
It took effect in September 1996.  
The most important of these are changes to the provisions dealing with conditional sentences. 
But concerns have arisen which must be addressed.  
Other than this, offenders will not get any credit for the time lost. 
The changes I am proposing would create two new exemptions. 
Second, it would allow gambling operations on international cruise ships.  
(The House adjourned at 6.08 p.m.)
