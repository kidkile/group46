PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Speaker, I move that the 49th report be concurred in.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition deals with the Young Offenders Act. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the third petition deals with Senate elections.

Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to submit this morning. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
We established a special advisory committee to provide ongoing comments. 
We received input from close to 10,000 of our employees. 
The reasons for this broad range of support are really quite simple. 
I was in business for 20 years before I went into politics. 
What a time consuming waste for business people.  
We hear it from the provinces every single day. 
We hear it from small businesses. 
Canadians want governments to work together for their citizens. 
They do not want to build a parallel tax system across the country. 
Canadians have said that repeatedly. 
Get governments to work together to cut costs and streamline the process. 
The new agency makes plain, ordinary, everyday sense.  
Do not listen to me. 
Listen to other Canadians. 
Those are all compelling reasons for creating a new agency.  
The power of computers is doubling every 18 months. 
We simply have to modernize that system. 
We have to design faster and fairer staffing procedures. 
Technology is forcing us to make choices. 
Or we have a choice, we can work together to produce those systems.  
Instead it came to the federal government. 
Of that, $13 billion will be done in Canada. 
Does that make sense, 12 different systems for business to deal with? 
Working together to serve the interest of Canadians makes sense.  
We are making a very serious effort to reach out.  
I must emphasize that the participation of the provinces is completely voluntary. 
I have met with the provinces. 
I have met them on a number of occasions. 
They all have supported the concept and we will work closely with them. 
But I am a realist. 
We have lots of examples. 
When we try to get everybody on board it never gets done. 
We have to move on and show leadership.  
The agency represents an opportunity. 
Having the infrastructure at least allows that opportunity''.  
Most important, we have acted to strengthen ministerial accountability. 
I took that message very much to heart. 
The minister will submit an annual report on its operations to parliament.  
Parliament will conduct a legislative review in five years.  
Only the minister will have that oversight power.  
As the Institute of Chartered Accountants told the same committee: 
Earning the trust of as many provinces as possible is essential. 
I am trying to do that by building a better framework.  
Ensuring fairness for every single taxpayer is also very critical. 
That will be my priority every hour of every day. 
Canadians deserve nothing less.  
That, after all, is what makes it all work.  
It is a system upheld by public servants of hard work and decency.  
This legislation is a major step in that direction. 
This legislation is a major step forward. 
I do not understand it, but it is the bedrock of democracy.  
First, there is only one level of taxpayer in Canada. 
In the end, this bill is not about politics. 
It is about doing something positive for Canada.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Why did he cut short democratic deliberation when it came to this bill?  
I can tell the House why. 
Canadians will suddenly wake up startled, wondering what is going on. 
In a sense they were provoking the government into time allocation. 
The minister talked about common sense. 
All of these improvements could be achieved without Revenue Canada metamorphosing itself into an agency. 
It simply is not necessary.  
That is not just my view. 
I want to be absolutely clear for the record. 
That alleged rationale simply does not hold up.  
Revenue Canada every business day collects roughly a billion dollars. 
That is a billion dollars sucked out, hoovered out of the pockets of Canadian taxpayers. 
I see even you are flabbergasted, Mr. Speaker. 
That is not my figure. 
That is just plain wrong.  
I do not understand that bureaucratic bafflegab. 
Where does the buck stop? 
It is not absolutely clear.  
Why is that necessary? 
It is an awesome power that we wield here. 
Sometimes, believe it or not, that power is abused. 
I raise the matter, for instance, of Mrs. Suzanne Thiessen from Winnipeg. 
I have raised this matter before in question period and elsewhere. 
How does it happen? 
What kind of response do we get to this breach of confidentiality? 
Janice Collingridge is a high stem quadriplegic. 
They said they were going to take a look at how she was spending it.  
This is more money than she has in her life savings. 
They tried to shake her down for that $5,000 plus interest and penalties. 
That is what is wrong with the tax system.  
I have raised this matter with the minister. 
I know there are other matters like it. 
Tax lawyers can tell us about them. 
What does the minister say? 
It will not answer that question.  
I will comment on another case. 
He was subdividing some land he owned for development. 
Those kinds of things happen every day of the week in Canada. 
There is no accountability when it happens. 
That is why we have proposed the adoption of a taxpayers bill of rights. 
The government has not even had the straightforwardness to respond to our offer.  
What would the proposed taxpayers bill of rights do? 
It is a worthwhile document. 
Basically it is a motherhood statement, but it has no teeth, no sanctions. 
It does not have statutory force. 
It does not impose any sanctions on Revenue Canada if it steps out of bounds.  
Revenue officials would be required to inform taxpayers of overpayment.  
He could not pay rent or buy groceries.  
Perron (Riviere-des-Mille-Iles, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Apparently, to lead is to listen, to consult and to act. 
It simply packed the gallery with Liberal members and gagged the opposition. 
Last year, I was a member of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
I have no idea.  
Governing is about respecting people. 
No, it is not.  
This is a flagrant lack of respect.  
Governing is about being fair. 
What did the government do? 
This is disrespectful and unfair.  
A profit at whose expense? 
I'd like to know the Royal Bank's golf budget. 
This shows a lack of respect.  
Governing also means making choices. 
The government has chosen to establish agencies. 
That is what our auditor general says.  
Why spend money to create another level of public officials? 
The appointment of a commissioner and a deputy commissioner creates another level of officials. 
I mentioned existing agencies earlier. 
Let us look at the new wheat board in western Canada.  
It flies by the seat of its pants. 
Nav Canada simply decided to close the control tower in Gatineau. 
Nav Canada closed the tower at Baie-Comeau. 
An accident occurred at Baie-Comeau yesterday. 
Nav Canada said ``No problem. 
We will not cut jobs. 
At least for two or three years, we will not cut jobs''. 
What happened to the promise? 
On questioning, the Minister of Transport says ``They are making adjustments. 
They are doing their job. 
There is the ADM, the Montreal airports agency. 
Previously, there was a good and interesting arrangement. 
This was done, but there has been chaos ever since. 
That is what we get with agencies. 
He can wash his hands of his responsibilities. 
The government is afraid to govern, afraid to do its job. 
That is what governing is about, not what the government is doing.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today for two reasons. 
This weekend I had the opportunity to meet a number of my constituents. 
I learned a few good ones. 
I know of no other disease that is a greater threat to Canada's future. 
It is a ridiculous bill that most Canadians reject.  
It lets the time go by. 
It manages time, that is all. 
When things do not suit it, it manages time by stifling the opposition.  
It takes out the baseball bat.  
Let us look at the situation a little more closely. 
In five years, the Liberals have already beaten the Mulroney government's record. 
But the honeymoon is nearly over.  
We criticize this government every day. 
But there is even more. 
There is no urgency in this area. 
There was some urgency about it, in order to protect an industry. 
We could have moved more quickly with that bill. 
It was to defend one of our industries, to defend Canadian culture. 
There is no national crisis, nor international one. 
This bill requires major improvements.  
This will get me a good job''.  
Mr. Vallerand came and told the committee how great this agency would be. 
But the government turned a deaf ear.  
Our opposition is based on a large number of major and important reasons. 
It is rejecting our input and it refuses to change anything.  
I want the people to know how harmful this agency will be. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
We believe the agency is the largest Liberal Trojan horse for privatization. 
This is way beyond the concept of delivering better services. 
The government would also take credit for slashing expenditures by $2.2 billion.  
Nor does it have the support of the majority of its workers. 
The major stakeholders are not buying into this idea. 
There is no firm support by the provinces for a single taxation agency. 
B.C. and Saskatchewan have not endorsed the concept. 
Alberta has supported the concept of an independent agency for ideological reasons. 
There is no valid case for an independent agency. 
These are at best exaggerated.  
Nothing prevents the government from hiring these auditors now. 
Details of the recourse mechanisms are not available and are not provided by the legislation.  
For all these reasons the NDP will be voting against Bill C-43.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The track record of the government in this area has not been that successful. 
We have significant difficulties with this piece of legislation. 
The government is actually talking about unions. 
Chrysler Canada has as a member of its board a representative of the CAW. 
This government is saying ``We cannot work with the public service. 
The Minister of Industry has said high taxes actually encourage productivity. 
There has never been a statement of economic illiteracy as profound as that. 
The fact is that a low dollar does not benefit anybody. 
In the short term there may be some minute benefits to Canadian exporters. 
In the long term, however, we cannot devalue our way to prosperity.  
This is a time when the government should be setting an example. 
We can't do that. 
We are willing to risk the downsides of this agency. 
My cousin was headed for the public administration department at Dalhousie University. 
Canadians have not been consulted about it. 
There has been no discussion. 
We suggested that at committee. 
We suggested that in this House.  
That is the kind of consultation Canadians are looking for. 
A systemic abuse of power pervades this government. 
Canadians have access to the same information now that we do as parliamentarians. 
They want to participate in these types of important decisions.  
We will not be supporting Bill C-43. 
He is asking the government to go back to the public for renewed consultations.  
That was my question and I would like to hear the hon. member's answer.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for that very important question. 
They were not intended for that purpose.  
We have seen a secular decline in the role of the MP. 
We have seen an emasculation of MPs since the late 1960s in this House. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from across the way for his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question.  
I will deal with the privacy issue first. 
There is no shortage of great ideas. 
Periodically we could actually learn something.  
We do not have to reinvent the wheel. 
That can sometimes be bad as well.  
There are some great ideas out there and we need to work with Canadians. 
It is part of the secular decline in the Canadian dollar. 
In the long term that decline can reduce productivity even further. 
We do not need to reinvent the wheel. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party. 
I am glad to hear him talk about using committees. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments. 
That is clearly unacceptable.  
In answer to this, the government is talking about clamping down on the media. 
For the government to say it will clamp down on the media is absolutely ludicrous.  
It is a joke.  
The hon. member says that it is a joke. 
It is quite perverse and it is a joke but it is not that funny. 
It is a systemic issue that has to be dealt with. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Mississauga South.  
We need to show leadership. 
That is what the agency will accomplish.  
Those are the reasons why we are proposing the new agency. 
The new agency would have such authority. 
Collective agreements will remain in force. 
Pension and leave credits will remain intact. 
He will strengthen the legislation to do just that.  
I am convinced that the new agency will offer meaningful new opportunities for employees. 
There will be more career mobility. 
Vacancies will be filled in a few weeks rather than many months. 
That too is a clear example of better service to Canadians.  
For small businesses however, that is not the case at all. 
That is what this bill is all about. 
Better service through savings in time. 
Better service through savings in money. 
Better service through wise use of technology. 
Better service through new opportunities for partnerships. 
Better service through more employee flexibility and autonomy. 
Better service through streamlining and simplifying. 
The people who work at Revenue Canada will be the better for the agency. 
The people of Canada will be better for the new agency.  
We have put people first in establishing the agency. 
We have put people first in the mandate of the agency. 
We have put people first in the operation of the agency.  
I congratulate the Minister of National Revenue for this bill. 
In the end, this bill is in the public interest. 
In the end, this bill serves the people of Canada.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like my colleague to read Hansard carefully tomorrow.  
But she forgot to speak with Mr. Lampron. 
The committee received a brief from Mr. Lampron. 
She forgot to speak with all these people.  
The hon. member should have reviewed this survey and its findings before delivering her speech. 
Where did my colleague get her information?  
Time is going to be needed to establish the board of management. 
The simple answer is yes. 
We have also been asked by employees what employee benefits carry over to the agency. 
After that time there will be unified certification processes.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
This staff has been drawn from other areas within the department. 
The fundamental changes that are foreseen simply cannot be accomplished in the existing departmental structure. 
I want to talk a little about the user fees issue for a moment. 
Let me outline these controls.  
First, the minister will have to approve any new or increased fees.  
Time is very significant for business, particularly smaller firms.  
This in essence is the reason why consolidation of these activities is so important.  
A single administration would result in real cost savings to the provinces. 
Transactions that take place in the wink of an eye are very difficult to track. 
We need to be able to respond to that. 
Modern problems require modern solutions. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
There is an old saying that ``Taxation without representation is tyranny''. 
It seems bent on reducing taxes for the rich.  
This clause seems to grant limitless powers to the agency. 
I will now read the most significant sentence of this clause: 
Mr. Speaker, the governing of a country is not a laughing matter. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I do not suppose all that millenarian stuff has anything rhetorical about it.  
The member asked about the board. 
It is all still there. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is nice to have you in the chair again. 
I will be splitting my time with the member for New Westminister-Coquitlam-Burnaby.  
The member who just spoke mentioned the new millennium. 
It is typical of the government to be totally out of touch with reality.  
They make good watches so they know how to measure time.  
I could get myself into trouble with that.  
I can see the government is shocked at that.  
This government is actually worse than the one that preceded it.  
Some sort of taxpayer bill of rights is a great idea. 
It is simply not good enough to establish accountability to the minister. 
There must be a greater amount of transparency and accountability than simply to the minister.  
Perhaps like the Prime Minister they get their advice from imaginary homeless people. 
It is just like this bill. 
The government will not listen to input that comes from the average person. 
The minister lives in a dream world of political correctness. 
I have a Squamish band in my riding. 
On the Squamish band reserve in North Vancouver there are 16 different chiefs. 
It is all hierarchal with no democracy in place.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
First was the issue of an ombudsman. 
Therefore Canadians do have an ombudsman. 
In fact, they have 301 ombudsmen. 
Each and every one of us has that responsibility. 
I know we have all served our constituents.  
It is an interesting notion. 
In just a moment I will come back to some specific points on that.  
I made no judgments about that at all.  
Maybe that 40% had some critical reasons why they did not like it. 
I can tell the member why they do not. 
There is absolutely no doubt about that.  
Mr. Speaker, I see you are cutting me off again. 
This is really bad news. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is Christmas time in Canada. 
It is known as the time of giving, not taking.  
Specifically the Bible says in Luke, chapter two: 
And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria. 
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 
Therefore in history governments tax and people pay. 
It has always been that way.  
The bill changes the legal basis of how taxes are collected. 
The Minister of National Revenue is named as the minister responsible for the agency.  
The bill is a dramatic historical change. 
Certainly we have evolved somewhat since Caesar taxed the world.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member is a lawyer. 
Mr. Speaker, perhaps we could take the example of the Criminal Code. 
The Young Offenders Act deals with process.  
I think it is the most appropriate place to put it.  
This is an insult to the employees of the revenue department. 
In my opinion, it will not sell.  
Mr. Speaker, I believe the provinces will adopt a wait and see approach. 
The professional manner has been well defined in the schools of public administration. 
Taxpayers have the right to understand laws with which they are required to comply. 
There has been a lot of debate about plain language. 
One can get a master's degree on that point.  
Revenue officials should inform taxpayers of overpayment. 
If the government does the right thing it will develop co-operation.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my colleague. 
I have heard debate from both sides of the House today. 
Mr. Speaker, the record is that they have not been doing so. 
None of the provinces have jumped on board. 
We will see if the agency actually delivers what it is said to deliver. 
This is something the auditor general talked about in the past.  
We will see whether or not the agency is innovative. 
The true test is in the pudding. 
The provinces may sign on if the government makes delivery in a proper manner.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
It is an important issue and I will address it in my speech.  
The minister will continue to be the person named to exercise those authorities. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
The minister remains responsible for the agency.  
This is not how it goes with other agencies.  
This is why I believe this agency will be more accountable. 
The auditor general will be auditing the agency's books. 
This agency is different from the others in many regards, in my opinion.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
This is a concern to me, as a Quebeckers and a sovereignist.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Fairness is an essential foundation to the entire revenue administration. 
The consultations were broad and comprehensive. 
One message was crystal clear in all this. 
Good service is fair service always.  
Fairness means being open, clear, courteous, responsive, timely and accessible. 
That is very important.  
I think it should be done at the department level''. 
That is well worth remembering.  
Canadians certainly expect no less and Canadians deserve no less. 
I therefore urge all members to support this very worthwhile legislation.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the very good question. 
There are still about three minutes left for questions and responses. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
PLANE CRASH AT POINTE-LEBEL 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Seven people lost their lives and another three were injured. 
All were from the North Shore.  
We pray for the victims, the injured and their families.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
It is only the beginning. 
Yesterday the minister turned down a request to meet with the franchisees directly. 
Is it because he knows they are right? 
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
I hope very much that this custom will continue for many years to come.  
My thanks to the organizers, the group Toujours Ensemble, and all the volunteers.  
VICTIMS OF GULF WAR SYNDROME 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
We have legislated gun control. 
Our government is committed to ending violence against all people in Canada. 
We hope these measures will help make our society safer.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Elwin has since won the leadership of the official opposition in Regina, the Saskatchewan Party. 
I wish them future success in their political endeavours.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
This Canadian feature film was nominated for 10 Genie awards. 
CANADA-CHINA LEGISLATIVE ASSOCIATION 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
China is now a place where people can make money. 
TRIBUTE TO MAURICE CHAMPAGNE 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
A poet and essayist, Mr. Champagne recently passed away. 
Maurice Champagne's accomplishments will survive him. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
This is a program that works. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
The House of Commons deserves to know who is the driving force behind this campaign. 
This was settled yesterday on a question of privilege. 
The hon. member for Thornhill.  
CANADIAN EXECUTIVE SERVICE ORGANIZATION 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
This agency had no practical experience in purchasing or simple procedures from which to operate.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadian jobs in rural communities are on the line. 
Just consider these facts. 
First, Canada is the lowest cost producer in the world. 
Finally, processing plants are largely farmer owned.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
In 1974 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada is facing a critical shortage of skilled tradespeople.  
The existing skilled workforce is aging.  
In Halton something is being done.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is what the Premier of Alberta said: 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Where is the new Young Offenders Act? 
Why does he not fix the Canadian dollar? 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
She wants a new hip so she can fix meals for herself.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, no one is trying to isolate anyone.  
We are negotiating together. 
We hope he will negotiate in good faith.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are not paranoid, but we are not deaf.  
There is a lot of unemployment among the youth. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
He said that he hoped he would act in good faith.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
They are cry babies.  
That is why negotiations are under way regarding the Canadian social union. 
One area we want to improve is the two way consultation process. 
This is under negotiation, and we hope to improve matters.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
If the health minister disagrees with these practices, what is he doing about it?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is a decision of the Ontario government. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The minister claims that his government supports the five principles of medicare. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
As the dollar drops we are seeing Canadians suffer.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member for Kings-Hants.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I do not think the minister heard my question. 
While the minister engages in dollar envy, Canadians are suffering. 
The hon. member for Kings-Hants.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We had a country whose currency was under attack. 
We had a country where interest rates were climbing.  
Today we have the strongest balance sheet- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This is the highest court in the land and we can do something about it.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is a nice try, but that forum is a defunct forum. 
It is not operating right now. 
It has been completely castrated in large respect by this government. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I rest my case.  
NATIONAL HOME CARE PROGRAM 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
We cannot do it without them; it would not be a good program''.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has a good imagination.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my previous words. 
The hon. member has no imagination.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Why is this finance minister so intent on scrooging Canadians?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member better get a new writer. 
The basic issue is the future of the Canada pension plan. 
The Reform Party does not believe in the Canada pension plan. 
The Liberal party does believe in the Canada pension plan.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
What is the real rate for the Canada pension plan? 
Is it 11%, 12%, 13%?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Those are the people we are speaking for.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the number of Canadian children living in poverty is constantly increasing. 
There is nothing in there for the poor.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We also think the best way is to get people back to work. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary is for the Minister of Finance, this time.  
There are children living in poverty because there are parents living in poverty. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Many of them dramatically change- 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Alberni.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we need action overseas on this issue.  
Yet the Liberals are doing nothing to counter this campaign. 
They are simply hoping that it will go away.  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We will continue to fight on behalf of B.C. forestry workers.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, the preamble to the question is false.  
These are components of a strong shipbuilding policy in Canada.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
How can this happen in Canada? 
How can an organized sex ring import sex slaves into Canada? 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
It is clear that Canada is committed to combat this problem. 
That is why we are engaged with different countries to combat that problem. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
The minister defended the process. 
The entire election results are now suspect.  
Will the government order an independent audit immediately?  
The problems will be corrected as rapidly as possible.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
How many wild oats is the wheat board and this minister trying to bury?  
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:
And the opposition applauds mythology.  
It will be producers on the board of directors- 
The hon. member for Bras d'Or-Cape Breton.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
Will you come to Cape Breton?  
The hon. Minister of Natural Resources.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the same minister.  
Mr. Speaker, what we want is a solution that works.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The industry is asking for a fair national shipbuilding policy. 
Our people are not asking for a subsidy.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
There is a 25% tariff on ships that are being imported into Canada. 
There is a government procurement policy on Canadian shipping.  
We are not prepared to give them. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The minister is very much confused. 
It is five years later. 
When will the minister and the government bring in a shipbuilding policy?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
However, let me say that does not mean it is all bad. 
In this case we have support for the shipbuilding industry. 
There is a 25% tariff.  
We cannot afford it.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I thought, what a stupid idea. 
Imagine my dismay to discover that it was being attributed to me.  
No, I do not favour high taxes. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Canada Post believes that is a good plan. 
Let us give it time to work and we will see what happens.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
The public is worried. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport has the floor.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Safety is top priority. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
On the backs of the unemployed people. 
That number has dropped to 38%.  
My question is for the deputy prime minister. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Yesterday I rose on a point of order, not on a question of privilege. 
It has gone beyond that. 
This is where it becomes confusing. 
The issue is very serious. 
I will go through specific citations in Beauchesne's. 
I will now read citation 93. 
I want the House to listen very carefully. 
They do, however, provide serious problems for the House. 
This was not made anonymously. 
It was made in the flesh by the member for Kenora-Rainy River. 
Citation 99 concludes with the following: 
It is direct and is not in any way made anonymously. 
I think this goes beyond an apology. 
It is a prima facie case of breach of privilege.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):
I am going to ask just a question, Mr. Speaker. 
Yesterday I ruled on a point of privilege. 
This is not the point of privilege from yesterday. 
That is over with. 
I am dealing with the point of privilege for today. 
The hon. member for Kenora-Rainy River is here. 
If he wishes to intervene, I invite him to do so. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
It was very much a debate thrust in a difference of opinion. 
That was the conversation. 
There was no intimidation. 
It was very much a debate that we have in this place all the time. 
I will hear the hon. member for Kenora-Rainy River.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
I have said it once and I am not about to say it again. 
We have the other hon. member giving his version of what went on. 
They are both hon. members of parliament. 
They are both giving their views as to something that transpired. 
I have to accept both hon. members' words that this is indeed what transpired.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
The case that concerns us today is different. 
``There is a difference. 
Mr. Speaker, I very respectfully submit this to your attention. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
It is a real hemorrhage.  
It is really more than unfortunate. 
It is totally unacceptable that we find ourselves in this situation once more today. 
After I hear them, I will make a ruling.  
I will then enjoin any member who wants to add to it. 
No one is deprived from speaking to this.  
When I know the hon. member will know.  
We are going to listen to it.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
On October 28 I submitted a written question. 
But I did not. 
All parts of the question involved this issue. 
However, staff found the question too long. 
They requested that it be divided into five separate questions. 
At the time I had one spot for a question on the order paper.  
Now we have the worst of both worlds. 
The standing orders do not provide staff with any guidance on the division of questions.  
A reasonable balance was established.  
This is a misuse of Standing Order 39. 
It is being used against members. 
It is being used to prevent them from asking questions. 
This could be done within the existing standing orders.  
Australia has a similar practice. 
The Australian practice seems to work. 
Questions are normally answered within one working week.  
Thus, members would not be prevented from asking further questions.  
Certainly, having questions answered within one week would be most welcome by all parliamentarians.  
In Question No. 91(i) we find an answer that is obviously wrong. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
They do not act as standard bearers for the government. 
The response sounds plausible until we give it a careful reading. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is totally different and that is debate.  
They have to do with the issue of Order Paper questions.  
The first item I wanted to address was the length of the question. 
It is not following any set prescription by the rules of order. 
That was the first item I wanted to raise.  
For some of them it is taking almost 200 days. 
The third issue is related and it is the factual nature of responses. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
For the interest of members, Standing Order 39(2) reads: 
It is right there in the standing orders. 
We accept your point.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief on this issue. 
I think that is what we are dealing with here. 
Standing Order 39(2) says: 
I am not blaming the clerk. 
We have charged him with this responsibility without giving him the detailed guidelines.  
The rules governing questions were established in the 33rd Parliament. 
Unfortunately the members in that parliament struck a bad deal with the government. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We are no different than anyone else outside the Chamber. 
It is part of the general malaise. 
The government does not respect the standing orders. 
It does not answer questions. 
People leak committee reports. 
The Speaker stands up to try to get order. 
People keep on yapping and yelling. 
What is going on around here, Mr. Speaker? 
It is not just Christmas. 
The government makes announcements. 
It does not even go across to the press gallery. 
We have complained about the government showing disrespect for the House. 
This is all part of the same piece.  
I would like to support the member in his point of order. 
But then we would really be back to the old system. 
That is one of the dangers in that particular suggestion. 
That is all I have to say on the matter. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the remarks of members opposite. 
He does take a great interest in the questions which he has tabled.  
There was some criticism of the existing standing orders. 
Mr. Speaker, I think you picked up on this. 
It is the job of staff to interpret them. 
One criterion is length. 
The member has addressed that. 
The number of questions has also been addressed. 
Then there is the question of the 45 day time limit. 
It has answered close to three out of four of those questions. 
Those are the facts.  
Another thing concerns me. 
We heard the opposition House leader speaking a moment ago. 
It is our standing committee which is responsible for the standing orders. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Speaker will get back to the House in due course.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify a point. 
I do not think I was attacking the staff. 
To suggest that is to deflect criticism away from the issue.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the motion presented by the chief government whip. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
I must admit this government worries me. 
It worries me a lot. 
That would be too much to ask of them. 
But to save them from what? 
I repeat, this government has no mandate to do this. 
I realize it is not an easy decision.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
The member should read that report as I have done. 
Nowhere in that report will a reference to tax breaks for millionaire athletes be found. 
Sports in Canada is an industry. 
It is a stunning figure and a frightening situation.  
I just wanted to correct the record in that regard.  
I did a bit of research. 
The bill has had debate. 
It has had input.  
How many clauses might hon. members think are in the bill? 
There happened to be 188. 
Let us talk about quotes from some of the folks whom we have talked to. 
The minister of finance for the province of Nova Scotia, Mr. Don Downe said: 
Why should we fight over who collects it? 
It gets transferred down to the provinces. 
He goes on in his letter: 
I am sure members get my point.  
We have incredible support for our Prime Minister and for the policies of the government. 
Let me share the comments of Stockwell Day: 
It is an agency whose time has come.  
We were gagged, quite simply, when the witnesses came before the committee.  
He says there was great participation. 
Robert Spindler of Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants said: 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. windbag opposite is a johnny-come-lately to this issue. 
He should know, as I have followed the issue- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I have corresponded with all 10 provincial finance ministers. 
I have spoken with several of them on this subject. 
There is really no difference.  
We know it is extremely important, representing Canadians from right across Canada, that opportunity exists.  
It is a fundamentally sound bill. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Canada's exports are at an all time high.  
This will not be a fleeting trend; the volume of activities will continue to increase.  
The commitment to improve client service will not change. 
Revenue Canada has done its very best to accommodate the new demand. 
There are few gains that can be made through this approach. 
That work has been done. 
There is new work to be undertaken. 
Revenue administration is not being devolved to anyone.  
The minister will ensure that the agency is providing appropriate services to Canadians.  
I can assure members that a taxpayer's personal information will remain confidential. 
To the contrary, Mr. Speaker. 
Revenue Canada can already administer harmonized taxes.  
Is that not what alternative service delivery is all about?  
I encourage all members in this House to support this important piece of legislation.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will take this in two parts. 
Does the House give its unanimous consent to present the motion?  
I will try with the second motion.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the House give its unanimous consent to present the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from the Bloc Quebecois for her comments.  
This initiative does not mean we are privatizing Revenue Canada. 
On the contrary, there will be more accountability with this new bill. 
Therefore, this bill improves the situation for Canadians.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if I understood well. 
Is it to harmonize federal and provincial tax laws? 
I do not know if that is what they want to do. 
The bill says that the agency will be their employer. 
Will the minister end up with his chauffeur as his sole employee? 
Is that what it means? 
Do we still need to have a minister in that case?  
Is the government looking to save money at the expense of public servants? 
It seems to me that this is an anti-union bill. 
The government is cutting the federal public service by 20%.  
Is that the purpose of this bill? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Bloc Quebecois member for his comments.  
If I might say, it is the typical paranoia from the Bloc Quebecois. 
What this new agency will do is it will provide more flexibility. 
It will eliminate redundancy, overlap and duplication. 
It will be one-stop shopping for businesses. 
It will provide efficiencies for government. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you will find unanimous consent for the following motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I am a former member of the Public Service Alliance. 
Services will go with the jobs. 
The government has found a way to eliminate 40,000 jobs. 
It has decided to establish a new agency. 
By so doing it will also break the unions. 
I met with their union representatives. 
They are tired of the insecurity. 
This is not complicated. 
The same will happen with the Canada customs and revenue agency. 
But the hon. member did not tell us how many jobs will be cut.  
Back home, in Bouctouche, the employment centre has been closed. 
In the Department of Human Resources Development alone, 5,000 jobs have been cut. 
People have to travel to Richibucto, Shediac, or Moncton. 
Recently, the UN stated the same thing we have been saying for years. 
The Liberal government tells us these findings are based on the statistics for 1995. 
How many people qualify for EI benefits today, compared to 1995? 
How many more children live in poverty, compared to 1995? 
I would be ashamed to say these are the figures for 1995. 
I am here today to say that we know the truth. 
We know that people are living in poverty. 
Because these children are poor. 
We have to help them, we have to share our wealth. 
But they only feel for banks and millionaires.  
Millionaires will benefit and the gap between rich and poor will grow even larger.  
And then the Minister of Finance gets up and brags about doing this and that. 
We do not hear anything on that score. 
This is the mandate of the Liberal governement.  
What happened in New Brunswick? 
We got a 15% tax on everything. 
Frank McKenna was very happy to have done it. 
I think he got a little bonus at the time.  
When an agency is set up, we have to look at the facts. 
This is just another way to reduce job security. 
Some things never change.  
It is no different when we talk about lowering taxes. 
Opposition parties felt the premiums should have been reduced even further. 
Is this so hard to understand?  
Is this not causing problems? 
Is this not causing problems for our small and medium size businesses?  
There is no longer any money in circulation. 
Some members of parliament are saying that premiums have not been reduced enough. 
This does not help the small employer.  
I know my maths. 
Members should look at what is going on in the hospitals. 
They should come and see the waiting lists in New Brunswick. 
We do not have the same level of service. 
We cannot see a doctor in less than 45 minutes in New Brunswick. 
I am beginning to wonder if we really do have the same level of service. 
And it is still going on. 
There is also the issue of pay equity. 
The Department of National Revenue has 40,000 employees. 
The United Nations said it. 
We are supposed to be a model country. 
And now we have our infamous toll highway. 
The same applies to post-secondary education.  
It is exactly the same thing with Bill C-43. 
The government says it is a good thing. 
We have heard that one before. 
It is good for a very small group of millionaires. 
Everything is good for them.  
Members have the nerve to criticize while I am talking. 
They are critical because they refuse to see there is a problem in this country. 
That way, they can go to bed and sleep at night. 
They are denying reality, but reality will catch up with them one day. 
It is breathing down their necks.  
Canadians have to realize that service are also on the way out. 
Once the employees are gone, so is the service.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are going to find new adjectives that are more presentable in the House. 
It is just not appropriate.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
The second point in the powerlessness of the Minister of National Revenue. 
I wonder how appropriate it is to still have a minister responsible for this.  
That is not peanuts.  
It would like to offer its services to the provinces. 
Where is the government going with this?  
Is this where Canada is headed?  
It is provided that 15 directors will be appointed, including a chairperson and a commissioner. 
I will do just that. 
Clause 30(1) provides, and I quote: 
30.(1) The Agency has authority over all matters relating to 
(a) general administrative policy in the Agency; 
(c) Agency real property as defined in Section 73; and 
This is very worrisome.  
That will be fun. 
Who will be answerable to Canadians as shareholders?  
They are very good at cover-ups. 
Is that what we can expect? 
But who lives by the sea? 
Fishers and plant workers.  
The whole mess is no longer its problem. 
On the one hand, it tries to get rid of 20% of its public servants. 
It blows all over the place. 
Nobody will be able to understand it any more. 
I am quite willing to believe- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, but I have to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Hamilton West, on a point of order.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe that you will find consent for the following motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
There are few businesses today that do not use a computer somewhere in their organization. 
This is good economic policy and good social policy.  
These statistics speak for themselves and the government is paying close attention.  
The CSLP is helping 380,000 students this year.  
We also increased loan limits by more than 50%. 
They had been frozen by the last government in 1984. 
We have brought in more flexible repayment rules. 
This bill is more than a simple tax credit. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for London North Centre. 
We must indeed support our young people, as our hon. colleague said. 
But that is what we, in Quebec, have been doing since 1964. 
We are very proud of this system.  
We will be voting in favour of this bill.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
The total cost of this new tax measure may amount to some $800 million. 
It would be a major step in helping students. 
The fund will not ease existing student debts. 
This would protect Canada's human capital.  
They have also added that they want 100% grants. 
However, the country just cannot afford it at the present time.  
Finances alone should not be a barrier. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
As well, $4 billion has been cut from training.  
Students are paying the price for that. 
That needs to be said.  
That has really had a very dramatic impact on students. 
It used to be that a student could declare bankruptcy two years after completing studies. 
It should be pointed out that most students do not declare bankruptcy. 
Most students will do everything they can to pay off their Canada student loan. 
That virtually rules out that option.  
I am glad the member brought this forward. 
That is something that needs to be done on a national basis.  
It is an appalling situation.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
The bill we are discussing is a good one. 
It is an improvement. 
Tuition increases are prohibitive. 
It will get the full support of the Conservative caucus.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
This responsibility belongs to us all. 
We recognize the need to remain competitive in a global economy. 
As a government, we put a lot of our efforts into measures promoting education. 
The scholarships will support a wide variety of knowledge acquisition and skills development programs. 
Experience is also an essential requirement. 
This is a reality with which young people in search of work are very familiar. 
Managers want employees who are qualified, educated and experienced.  
For 1998-99, the strategy has a budget of $427 million. 
We are aware that students' indebtedness is a real problem. 
These initiatives include the millennium scholarships, to which I just referred.  
All these initiatives show that this government firmly believes in the importance of education. 
It is a priority for us. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. 
However, growing indebtedness has put many Canadian students and graduates in a difficult situation. 
It is always an issue of debate when it comes to these types of issues. 
I to congratulate the hon. member for bringing this forward.  
Like others this evening, I congratulate him for bringing this bill forward.  
So we actually have grants which help students avoid debt.  
In effect the millennium scholarships are also grants. 
They will be based on need. 
Bill C-316 deals with the interest aspect. 
The member for London North Centre is right.  
There are now many compulsory student ancillary fees. 
They are not really ancillary fees anymore. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):
We have to look at all measures. 
The bill is not perfect.  
We know that education is a provincial jurisdiction. 
We know that the provinces set the tuition fees. 
We know that the provinces set the curriculum. 
We know education leads to a much more prosperous life. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP) moved: 
I appreciate that very much. 
The concept is job creation through energy conservation. 
I built energy generating stations. 
Obviously that was the kind of work that we looked forward to as tradespeople. 
This was something we were looking forward to. 
When the province of Ontario cancelled this project we were devastated.  
At that time I was representing the carpenters union in the province of Manitoba. 
We had 1,200 members who were anxiously waiting to build Conawapa. 
It was something we wanted to do. 
When it was cancelled these people literally did not know which way to turn.  
That led us to investigate other ideas. 
How would we put these people to work? 
This came as a huge relief. 
This is what led us to this conclusion. 
For many years we have been pushing this idea. 
We have been training our people in anticipation of this idea catching on.  
In this motion I point to the federal government owning 50,000 buildings. 
It does have some measures under way. 
Nobody is trying to say that the federal government is doing nothing in this regard. 
There is the federal building initiative program. 
The savings are unbelievable.  
I believe it was the Harry Hays building. 
It resulted in an energy saving of $300,000 per year. 
That is for one building. 
We created a lot of jobs. 
And we saved $300,000.  
In the document ``A Brighter Future:
They wanted us to do everything electrically, to turn on the lights. 
We cannot do that any more.  
Some of these buildings are belching out unbelievable amounts of pollution. 
In the trade that I represent, the average age of a tradesman is 48 years. 
We could show the world. 
We are already leaders in many aspects. 
There are other aspects of energy retrofitting. 
It is called the ESCO industry, energy services contracting. 
Many private financial institutions are involved. 
It is a very high tech field. 
What are we waiting for? 
The province of Manitoba spends $3.2 billion a year on energy. 
One would think that would be really smart.  
Seven nuclear power plants at $10 billion each. 
That means it does not have to borrow that money on the open market. 
The Tennessee Valley hydro authority has similar statistics.  
I do not know why we are so slow on this. 
We live in a harsh winter climate where energy costs are a huge issue. 
I believe this is possible.  
People ask what the motivation is behind this. 
Frankly I sound like a broken record. 
Everybody said that it was fabulous and great, that it was a public-private partnership.  
We have the financiers in place. 
Just let us use your buildings''. 
Frankly, it did not really go very far.  
They want a much greater rate of return on their investment. 
In Manitoba we are still dealing with the flooding of South Indian Lake.  
Building a hydro project on a river is radical intervention in an ecosystem. 
We cannot enter into that kind of project lightly. 
Building another generating station should only be a last resort. 
It is just irresponsible.  
There are many measures in energy retrofitting. 
We can save $75 a year for a $15 investment. 
That is how painfully obvious the measures are. 
Why do people not do that?  
Now we have taken the last obstacle away. 
There would be hundreds of thousands of jobs with no charge to the taxpayer. 
The whole industry is anxiously waiting to get started. 
They are eagerly awaiting and anticipating this volume of work. 
It is an ethical investment and it is good work.  
Those jobs will be more evenly distributed. 
It would be a far more equitable type of project.  
We could view it as a megaproject but it is spread over the country. 
Let the industry pay for it. 
It just wants to use the government buildings. 
It is long overdue. 
I welcome the support of other members in this regard.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
It is an excellent motion. 
We will be supporting it when it comes time to vote.  
The federal government must show leadership on this issue. 
The best way to do that is through action rather than words. 
Also we have 22,793 vehicles which should be energy efficient as well. 
At the end of the day everyone is a winner. 
I must make a brief aside. 
I have been married to an engineer for 30 years. 
His idea of energy efficiency is the new shower head. 
Job creation is a priority of the government. 
I would like to share some very impressive figures. 
I think the House will be interested in them, not that is it jam packed. 
This means even more savings and more job creation.  
The Department of Public Works and Government Services is not alone. 
He has been put in charge of this initiative. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Yes, the issue is motherhood and apple pie. 
The Kyoto example is certainly one of the better examples. 
This leads me to my first concern with this motion. 
At first glance this program seems ideal and it certainly does have merit. 
It would lead one to say ``What is holding us back? 
Why are we not going at this full bore?''  
Programs fail to live up to expectations and are therefore kept from the public spotlight. 
We were provided with only three pieces of information. 
However, gathering information has certainly proved to be an onerous task.  
Certainly the NDP motion that we are dealing with today fits into that category. 
All Canadians share those ideals.  
All programs come at a cost to Canadians. 
There are no free rides. 
The motion also calls for the development of high-tech expertise. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
There are undeniable financial benefits to energy efficiency. 
In this respect, the experience of Quebec is a case in point. 
The latest available statistics date back to 1994 but nevertheless speak volumes. 
Strategic tools are limited and Natural Resources Canada is focussing primarily on public awareness. 
All this was pointed out by the auditor general in 1997.  
Logically, the motion implies that the Government of Canada should launch new initiatives. 
Energy is a provincial responsibility. 
This obviously includes energy efficiency. 
Furthermore, Quebec is in the forefront when it comes to energy efficiency.  
In 1997, the Government of Quebec created the Agence de l'efficacite energetique. 
This agency has the backing of all Quebeckers. 
The legislation that created it was passed unanimously in the National Assembly. 
The federal government ought not to be needlessly duplicating provincial efforts.  
The Bloc Quebecois is not questioning this logic. 
Unfortunately, the Government of Canada's track record in this regard is disappointing. 
Existing initiatives could be much better managed.  
This is why we are reluctant to support the motion. 
Before investing more money, the government must ensure that existing programs are well run.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The Progressive Conservative Party indeed agrees with that.  
We are now seeing a number of extreme weather events. 
It is prudent for us to look at this issue.  
The government needs to engage in more energy efficiency. 
The Reform Party still disputes whether the science on climate change is real. 
The Progressive Conservative Party will be supporting this motion by the member for Winnipeg Centre.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
It deserves the careful attention of this House.  
The impact of these NRCan programs has been very positive. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Then they ask them to repay $15,000 or $20,000.  
In the House they say things that are not true.  
Is this now discrimination against women?  
They did not check boys, sons working for their fathers. 
Why do it for a daughter working for her father? 
Why only the daughter or the mother?  
This does not only occur in New Brunswick. 
In the Magdalen Islands, a lot of women work with their husbands. 
Even the investigators were saying it is a matter of time. 
Fishing is essentially a family business. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised an important question. 
They basically came to the hon. member with what I would call a serious complaint. 
They felt that they were not receiving due process.  
Again, these allegations of abuse came from the community members themselves. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
That is far from enough.  
He does not act. 
One hundred thousand are excluded because they left their jobs without valid grounds. 
What we are asking is that the system be improved. 
He is also telling us the Bloc Quebecois wants people to be unemployed. 
I could have used four minutes more.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
They have not wanted to look at the true facts.  
It is a tool. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
These things have all been suspended by the government. 
We need a judicial inquiry to clean up this mess. 
Reform is asking for an independent judicial inquiry and Canadians agree. 
This was the premise of my question to the Deputy Prime Minister. 
In fact the charter is mainly there to restrain governments.  
Section 2(b) of the charter speaks of freedom of expression. 
If the government restricts these thoughts it is trenching upon the guarantee. 
Section 2(c) of the charter speaks of freedom of assembly. 
The rights of an accused cannot be restricted on a speculative concern of danger. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
It has been brought into force to review the particular complaint in that situation.  
That is a very simple request. 
We have no active role. 
The process was formulated by parliament in a non-partisan way. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 8.02 p.m.)
