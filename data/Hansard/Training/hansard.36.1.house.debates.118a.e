The House met at 10 a.m. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I seek unanimous consent to move: 
Is there unanimous consent?  
What is this about, Mr. Speaker? 
My colleague asked a question. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Therefore, the motion cannot be put.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
The new Canadian biotechnology strategy involves three departments:
Industry, Health and Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
We all wish her well.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I draw to your attention Standing Order 67(1)(p) which states: 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
There is a procedure that has to be in place. 
There is notice that has to be given. 
I am loath to interfere at any time like this. 
I am going to allow this Standing Order 56.1 to stand.  
It is an order of the House. 
Otherwise all of the issues we deal with here- 
I made a ruling on this issue. 
Now the House will have a chance to pronounce itself.  
Mr. Speaker, a point of order.  
Not on this issue. 
I have made a ruling.  
The question is on the motion. 
Will those members who object to the motion please rise in their places.  
The hon. member on a point of order.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I point out to your attention Standing Order 67: 
The following motions are debatable: 
This motion is not debatable. 
I repeat, will those members who object to the motion please rise in their places.  
And 25 members having risen: 
Because there are 25 members standing in their places, this motion is deemed withdrawn.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 27(1), I move: 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased actually to debate this motion. 
Could you tell me, Mr. Speaker, first of all how much time I have?  
As long as you want.  
Until 4 a.m., right? 
Take two hours, Randy.  
What does a fellow do for two hours in the House of Commons any more?  
The need for this motion is obvious to those on this side of the House. 
Here it is the 10th of June today.  
It will be the 10th at four in the morning anyway.  
We are going to make you work for a change. 
We are going to make you come in here until four in the morning''. 
Well I have news for the government. 
We do not mind that in the least.  
We have a lot of things to talk about in this country. 
The hon. member has two hours at his disposal if he chooses to use it. 
Mr. Speaker, I needed a little break to confirm something else as well.  
Here we are wanting to deal with the estimates today. 
We understand that the House may possibly not sit next week. 
We do not know.  
We have brought this up numerous times. 
Listen to what we are saying. 
Why is that so hard to understand? 
Why is that so hard to get? 
What do we get to do about it? 
The Speaker does not allow it. 
Somehow we in opposition have to show the frustration and that is all. 
Every day is like that and that is fact.  
We have drawn the line. 
Henceforth that will not occur in this House. 
Henceforth we will be drawing up unanimous consent motions such as this one. 
Henceforth this government is going to go through the mill on this issue. 
I wonder what the people watching this today think.  
I heard someone say they have an idiot standing here talking.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think that is out of order.  
It certainly would be a word the Chair would find offensive. 
The Chair did not hear the word. 
I do not know whether the hon. member wishes to clarify the position.  
As to the point of order, Mr. Speaker you are right. 
I lost my head for a moment, as Reform members often do. 
I did use a word which was unparliamentary. 
I called the leader of the House for the official opposition an idiot. 
Mr. Speaker, that is really good. 
There are those who would say I have been called worse than that before.  
I guess in parliament it is a little different. 
They seem to get excited when the opposition over here catches them sleeping. 
Is that what democracy has come to?  
It is going downhill in the House of Commons. 
I am not going to take any further of my time on this. 
I know there are other members that want to talk to this. 
We did not come here to face the other side with all the seats empty. 
It is going to cost a lot of hours and it is all unnecessary. 
This government should understand this. 
There is an obligation to listen. 
There is an obligation to be in this House. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to participate in this debate. 
``Everybody loves somebody sometime. 
Everybody calls for Reform members. 
Something in your moves just told me your sometime is now''.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I think this motion is inappropriate at any time.  
Some of us imagine ourselves in opposition all the time.  
We all have the responsibility to try to imagine what is best for the institution. 
What is not good for the institution are these motions. 
They may not have always liked what opposition members were saying. 
But they were there. 
That is quite beside the point. 
It cannot go on like this.  
But somebody is responsible over there. 
I think this speaks to a larger problem. 
We are all tempted to do that. 
I think we are all guilty of that each in our own way. 
I think this is what has happened. 
It is very regrettable. 
I think the government has created this situation. 
This morning it had 39 members on the other side- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not think that is a valid point of order.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
That would not require very many government members.  
We all have committee responsibilities. 
People cannot hide behind committee responsibilities. 
We all have to take our share in committees. 
It is not always easy.  
It should have at least one cabinet minister in the House, if not two. 
We can have some kind of exchange.  
This is not good for parliament and it is not good for the country.  
You are always here.  
I will finish with a word of constructive criticism. 
I hope it will be taken in the spirit in which it is offered. 
I admire them for that. 
I would ask them to think of that as well.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I commend the member on his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I have just started my 20th year. 
This is a new development.  
In the sense of what is now happening I think it is a good thing.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The House leader of the NDP obviously has a great history in this place.  
He spoke very eloquently to this issue. 
That is the point I was trying to make.  
The problem is that it is not rare. 
In previous parliaments it just grew like Topsy. 
People kind of twig on to that and they lose interest. 
What happens is we throw out the baby with the bathwater on that. 
That might be the subject of some kind of thesis for some student. 
It is more than I can go into at the moment. 
I think there is an interesting irony there.  
We need to stop regarding that as a waste of time. 
That gives people time to mobilize. 
It gives the Canadian people time to figure out what is going on. 
It gives the media time to decide that they are going to cover it. 
There is no time for process. 
It is not even willing to go through the motions any more. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I always enjoy listening to the House leader of the NDP. 
It is not only my read on history. 
They state that reasonable delaying tactics are acceptable in the House of Commons.  
The government just says it is its way or- 
The time for questions and comments has expired. 
I am afraid we have run out of minutes. 
The Chair wishes to apologize to the House for that error. 
We did not want to have a bad precedent set by that ruling.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
There is obviously a digression. 
There is something afoot that seems to be undermining the relevance of parliament.  
That was displayed in the House this morning. 
So here we are. 
Standing Order 56 has been debated. 
It has been used on a number of occasions in this parliament. 
There are far too few members on that side of the House. 
The debates that occur in this place should be of interest and importance. 
One would only hope that we can learn from this debate.  
If that is the way it has to go, we will be here. 
The purpose of this was to send a message that the opposition matters. 
That is not a bad message to come from this debate. 
There also has to be a shift in attitude. 
We cannot simply acquiesce. 
The role of the opposition here is to hold this government accountable. 
We are also charged with protecting the public interest.  
This has been a healthy debate. 
It is a matter of respect and attitude. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
A proper functioning democracy needs an efficient opposition.  
We talked about two things. 
I talked about the role of the opposition. 
The opposition is required. 
Mr. Diefenbaker made proper use of that. 
The election turned on that.  
The legislature was not sitting. 
We need to have public scrutiny. 
We need to have public debate. 
We need to have the legislature sit''.  
That was back in the early seventies. 
Because of that the Barrett government fell. 
That happened about 25 years ago. 
It just does not want to bother talking about them.  
This is not a national pipeline debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that question. 
It could be limited. 
That might be one suggestion.  
They have changed over time. 
It is their application. 
It has misused the rules or the tools of this place.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is an outcry today.  
Now they are telling us how to do our job. 
At some point, the ridiculous comments have to stop. 
Enough of this hypocrisy. 
I will tell members something about hypocrisy.  
They take committee work seriously, the only ones who do.  
We do not agree on the basic premise, but we will- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think the hon. member is getting into a debate here. 
The hon. member for Bourassa.  
The truth hurts, Mr. Speaker, but that is perfectly normal. 
They are trying to pull a fast one. 
Allow me to point out something. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member is on a point of debate, not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, the truth hurts and pressure is building up on the other side. 
The opposition wants to sit until four in the morning? 
I have no problem with that. 
I have been working hard for 10 years to be a member. 
I can be here for hours and speak forever.  
Opposition members want to raise points of order? 
Let them do so. 
I do not see many members from the NDP in the House. 
It is this government that eliminated the deficit. 
It is this government that took position- 
On the back of the unemployed and the poor.  
The other side is whining again. 
We allocated $850 million.  
Another point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member for Bourassa has the floor.  
I think hon. members might allow the member for Bourassa to complete his remarks. 
I know that what he is saying is clearly provocative. 
On the other hand it is not a matter of consent.  
I urge hon. members to allow the member to complete his remarks.  
He is going to cry again.  
Mr. Speaker, there is a point of order here. 
The Chair tries to ensure that the words used in debate are within the rules. 
There is a short fuse, Mr. Speaker. 
When the truth hurts, this is what happens. 
But Canadians will not be fooled. 
They committed adultery and gave birth to the NDP. 
Look at the results.  
The people of Bourassa are proud of their Liberal member in this House.  
That is today's reality. 
Mr. Speaker, they are getting upset.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask the member to withdraw that statement.  
I will not rule it unparliamentary.  
Mr. Speaker, we are beginning to understand them. 
If the word ``clown'' is not unparliamentary, I will say it again. 
It is simply for that. 
Mr. Denis Coderre: -but people will not be fooled. 
We have a government to be proud of.  
You are working for the public good''.  
In terms of the environment, we have done specific things. 
I will give them numbers. 
Where are the others?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
As a matter of fact the Reform Party has three- 
I continue, Mr. Speaker. 
We are in no rush. 
Who is doing the work?  
Who is doing their job? 
Who is actively looking out for the public's interests? 
The figures are there. 
But no, we have this little procedural tussle. 
I am clearly proud to be a member of this party. 
They are whining again. 
Next we know, they will be in tears.  
The other day, I heard someone say that backbenchers were unhappy in this place. 
We look after the public interest. 
We work for the public interest. 
What am I hearing from the Reform Party? 
They put francophones down. 
We, on the other hand, are taking our responsibilities.  
People are not stupid. 
What was the ultimate test? 
The facts speak for themselves. 
I am proud to be a member of this government. 
People need not worry, we are working. 
That is b.s., that is not true. 
We are doing our work in this House. 
The more Reformers run down the institution, the more harm they are doing to themselves. 
This can be done in a restrained and precise manner. 
Respecting the institution requires self-respect.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the closing comments were said accurately and succinctly.  
Mr. Speaker, if the shoe fits, let him wear it. 
Members must pay attention. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, today in the circus ring we heard the clown speak. 
He referred to committees and to pride in his party. 
Something happened here yesterday. 
That is unbelievable, when there are 156 of them. 
I am not afraid to bite, and I am not afraid of being bitten back.  
The hon. member is proud of his government and of his committees. 
The committee voted it down. 
Is he proud of that? 
Why is he whining? 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
I think the hon. member raises some very important points. 
This is my first term as a member of Parliament.  
It is my first mandate as an elected official to the House of Commons. 
I think the point was very well taken.  
When the hon. member says: 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague.  
By trying to demean the institution, the Reformers have once again demeaned themselves. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, respect for the institution means respect for the rules. 
He should be ashamed of himself.  
If you sling enough mud, some of it will stick. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the remarks. 
That is a very important fact which should be on the record.  
They should do their job in that respect.  
At least it can be used to make fertilizer''. 
This is the reply I could make to him.  
Finally, I have always taken part in the debates on substantive issues. 
We will call it quits for questions and comments on this speech at this time. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I know where two of them are. 
The deputy whip is looking for a safe place to hide today, no doubt. 
Mr. Speaker, you will like this. 
One member of the Reform Party appropriately handled the entire Liberal government last night. 
One of us is worth a thousand of them.  
They got caught with no members in the House. 
We certainly see no ministers when we are talking about issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Could you see if there is a quorum here.  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
I have to do a quorum count. 
There has been a call for quorum.  
I see a quorum. 
We will continue with the debate please.  
I thank them for showing up today.  
Therefore the committee meetings had to be cancelled or delayed. 
The government has done nothing to bring it into some sort of legislation. 
That motion was debated in the House. 
It was passed unanimously. 
A minister of the government made amendments.  
The government has totally disregarded the will of this House. 
It still has not dealt with that motion. 
The government still refuses to deal with that issue. 
It does not understand democracy.  
I will not dwell on that. 
She is the one who is really in trouble today.  
We do not come to this House to frivolously debate issues that make no sense. 
We can go on and talk about closure and time allocation. 
I know my time is just about up. 
I am sure she will.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
That is nine Liberals on every committee. 
That is where they have been this morning. 
We accept that members of parliament have many responsibilities. 
Surprise, it has taken two years for the Liberals to start talking about victims. 
This is one of the points I made in my speech. 
But nothing is being done to allow that by this government. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
I don't like it that he is right''- 
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I was quoting the paper. 
I did not realize that.  
Even the government House leader admits that it is their fault. 
They made the mistake. 
I wonder if the member would like to comment on that.  
Last night was just another example.  
They are keeping the Liberals accountable for everything they do.  
We do not care if it is three to nine on a particular committee. 
I say once again three Reformers can easily handle nine Liberals on any committee. 
We could actually bring some back and handle them on committee.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think we must all subject ourselves to a dose of reality. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It strikes me as a little irregular. 
However, is there unanimous consent to withdraw the motion?  
There is no such consent.  
He may not know that because I think he just got here.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
That is truly unfortunate.  
I see a quorum.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is very interesting.  
Of course, this upset them. 
The Reformers rose and started protesting. 
They swore that this was not their intention.  
Let me give you one example, just one. 
The Reformers talked about human rights, about democracy. 
They are not interested in protecting the interests of people or democracy. 
They are not interested in fighting poverty. 
They are only interested in debates of a technical nature.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I represent them in the issue of the definition of marriage. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions on another subject.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
They assume that none of them have any merit that would withstand a fair evaluation. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We are very anxious to have this question answered.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Shall all questions stand?  
MAIN ESTIMATES, 1998-99 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the President of the Treasury Board) moved: 
Mr. Speaker, I just need some clarification. 
That would certainly be the Chair's interpretation of the situation.  
I believe the standing orders provide that the extended sittings start tomorrow night. 
CONCURRENCE IN VOTE 1-JUSTICE 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the President of the Treasury Board) moved: 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is an important day. 
We have licked the deficit monster. 
We have looked it in the eye and we have met the challenge. 
That is a reduction of $42 billion in just four years.  
We will balance our budget next year and the year after. 
Put simply, we are at the start of a new fiscal era. 
We will continue to follow the balanced approach of sound economic and financial management. 
It is an approach that works.  
We were lumped with every troubled economy in the world. 
Canadians did not need The Wall Street Journal to convince them. 
They knew we needed a fundamental change.  
We cut $14 billion from federal program spending. 
The result is a leaner and more cost effective federal government. 
All of that is good news for Canadians.  
Thus now is not the time to relax and rest on our laurels. 
We now have to reduce the debt burden. 
That is why we will stay on course.  
It must and will be reduced. 
While these measures are necessarily modest for now they are significant. 
To do otherwise would be short-sighted and bad economics.  
The centrepiece of this effort is the Canadian opportunities strategy. 
They are a measure of our fiscal success. 
Also fuelled by our fiscal success the Canadian economy is showing significant strength. 
Job creation is up sharply. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the remarks of the hon. member.  
He spoke of his government's accomplishments. 
He spoke of the fact that the budget has now been balanced. 
He mentioned that the unemployment rate is now coming down. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:
There is no question that one administration leads into another. 
However, I must say that the political will was not there in the last government. 
In fact, what Mr. Mulroney said and what he did were two different things.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
We projected a growth of 3.5% in the economy. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his question, but the answer is no.  
What we have on this side of the House is a good management team. 
We have reviewed all of the departments. 
We have the ability and the will. 
Political will was lacking in the previous government. 
I am not sure of the Reform Party and its political platform. 
I am sure its members had some projected statistics. 
It was going to reduce transfers to all of the provinces.  
We have used a balanced approach. 
People of Canada have judged us. 
They have given us a second mandate. 
They recognize that we are doing a good job. 
We are investing in people. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
However, the deficit kept going up and up. 
The amount of money that Canadians were paying on interest kept escalating and escalating. 
They talked a good game, but they really did not do a lot.  
Now it is down to about 8%.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:
Madam Speaker, I thank the deputy whip for her comments. 
We are glad to have her on our side.  
I know the member personally. 
I know her useful experience, which is on track with mine. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
He talked about the wonderful economy that we have now. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:
Why did you promise it?  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:
We are running a good government. 
Last year, for instance, we paid down the foreign debt by $14 billion. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
It is this government that has done that. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:
There is no question. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
What it is aimed at specifically is using technology to combat crime. 
We moved what I considered to be useful amendments. 
The government, however, has chosen not to touch that. 
Again, I really question the wisdom of that. 
I only use this example to emphasize this point. 
There are over 600 unsolved murders in the province of British Columbia alone. 
The statistics across the country would be even more disturbing and more staggering.  
The Young Offenders Act is a prime example.  
The hon. member from the Reform Party spoke of the cuts to education. 
It cut the absolute basic necessities of Canadians.  
Is the federal government prepared to put its money where its mouth is? 
I certainly question the wisdom of that.  
One questions the wisdom of that.  
She has spoken of them at length. 
It is tantamount to not giving treatment in health care. 
That is equally true within our justice system. 
There would be no hesitation on our part to see those things happening.  
We have not seen it materialize as yet. 
Restorative justice is something that certainly would be a positive initiative. 
These are not new initiatives. 
It has been discussed at justice committee. 
Where is the money being spent? 
Where do this government's priorities lie? 
That simply is not true.  
The cost has absolutely ballooned. 
The original figures said $85 million. 
That is a conscious priority decision that the government has made. 
That again was a choice that the government made.  
It has expanded in its scope. 
There are more officers working on this file than before and to what end? 
It is certainly anything but justice that this is allowed to occur. 
It is a farce and Canadians should know that it is a farce.  
What can we do about it? 
We can talk in the House endlessly and talk until the cows come home. 
Police officers question whether it is going to improve the current justice system. 
On a number of occasions I asked the minister when that was going to happen. 
It has been before the standing committee. 
In 1995, 1,519 people were killed in Canada by impaired driving. 
That is another example of a change that could be made.  
I will be very interested to hear what the government has to say.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion is in order.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
He has already been very well accepted by all members of the House.  
The Liberals battled the former government fiercely on this issue. 
It was the same with the GST. 
Why was this government re-elected? 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, all this back slapping and patting on the back is really great. 
It is nice to hear. 
Everyone in here is of course a great parliamentarian. 
I would like to keep things in perspective however.  
The member was speaking for some length about gun control. 
Has the member any comments on that?  
That is completely different, completely outside the parameters of what Bill C-68 does.  
I do want to correct an inaccuracy. 
I know her personally to be a very straight shooter.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
It is not .08, 
Does the member or his party have an opinion on that?  
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for that question. 
We will be getting into the area of impaired driving in the fall. 
I look forward to the hon. member's participation in the debate.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
That will keep you going for a little while. 
It is almost two o'clock so we will proceed to Statements by Members. 
Of course the member will have the floor when we go back to the debate.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Dr. Stavros Naxakis is a chemistry and physics teacher at Vaughan Secondary School. 
Penny McLeod is a chemistry teacher at Thornhill Secondary School. 
She has spent 25 years developing new ideas for teaching her students. 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
OPTIMIST CLUB OF BRAMPTON 
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
Each club planned an event unique to its own community. 
Optimists strive to set a positive example for youth. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Approximately one out of one hundred Canadians will suffer from this disease in their lifetime.  
Schizophrenia causes acute suffering, increased homelessness and chronic unemployment. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
The Richard Ivey family name is synonymous with service and generosity. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us take a look at the chamber of sober second thought. 
He must do the right thing. 
Canadians want value for their tax dollars. 
They want a democracy. 
They want an elected Senate.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
We jokingly call looters non-traditional shoppers. 
Killers are described as morally challenged.  
All the world's major religions offer some form of the golden rule.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
My party supports the principle of self-determination.  
We must not taint the principle of self-determination.  
Must every issue this government deals with end up in the courts? 
These people have suffered long enough. 
The federal government has an obligation to meet with the representatives of the Denesuline- 
The hon. member for Laval-Est.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Member spoke in Japanese and provided the following translation: ] 
You are all welcome to attend the events scheduled for Japan Week.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Of course, Mr. Bouchard was not pleased by these comments. 
Grouchy as always, he tried to downplay the significance of the Calgary declaration.  
Call an election and you will see. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Unfortunately the minister did not go far enough. 
He refuses to create an atmosphere that will lead to a more vigilant parliament.  
Not a very auspicious beginning.  
The complaints are piling up and there is a lot of work to be done.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The explosion happened at lunch time. 
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR PARENT EDUCATION 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
My best wishes to the federation and its executive.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I gave an example. 
There are a lot of people among those who were infected with hepatitis C. 
The Reform Party has two types of compassion. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, people who smoke cigarettes know about the risks of cancer. 
It is written on the label. 
These hepatitis C victims were infected innocently. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am asking him about the people who got hepatitis C in other ways. 
If it is not a matter of responsibility, then it becomes a matter of compassion. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I intervened because I could not hear the response of the Prime Minister. 
If the Prime Minister wants to continue his answer I invite him to do so. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
We care about the victims. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the long hot summer for the Liberals has started. 
The Prime Minister had better explain why he does not understand the difference. 
There is a difference.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I recognize that the previous government in 1986 made a mistake. 
It was Krever who said that, not me.  
When there is no knowledge by the government, the notion of responsibility is extremely important. 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The Prime Minister started out by saying that drug addicts were the same. 
Now he says that smokers are the same. 
People who get an insect bite and accidentally get infected? 
Is he going to compensate them too?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly the point we are making. 
We are making the point that we are responsible. 
They are just trying to score political points and they are completely irresponsible.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Quebec is far from the only province facing problems. 
There are any number of examples throughout Canada.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is how things stand.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The hon. member for Roberval has the floor.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It was not a money issue for Dr. Rochon.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Dr. Rochon himself said that. 
For him, it was not a money issue.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He is responsible and he knows the consequences of what is going on.  
Before 1986 nobody in the system knew that it was dangerous to give blood transfusions. 
After 1986 we could have detected that. 
We had the responsibility. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, how low can you go? 
How sick can you get?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
It is very easy to be generous when the money is not yours''. 
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Prime Minister for his kind comments. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Obviously the health minister thinks this is okay. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is called hypocrisy.  
I would ask that we not use this term in the House. 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we can see for ourselves what goes on across the way- 
The hon. Minister of Health has the floor.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We have a balanced approach that has helped everybody in the country. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Yesterday I went to Dorval. 
I had a tour of the airport. 
I am proud of what ADM is doing to that airport. 
I am proud of the amount of traffic I saw there, international flights. 
There is no doubt that is the result of our policies in this government. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Can the Indian affairs minister tell us what the government's position is? 
Can she tell us in the federal government's eyes who owns British Columbia?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Let us be clear on what the First Nations are saying. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Will she answer the question of who owns B.C.?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the opposition is totally out of touch on this. 
The people of British Columbia understand it. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am surprised at the hon. member. 
When a market reaches 300,000 trips, then the government can designate a second carrier. 
The same will go for the other countries. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us talk about the existing policy.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
In other words this fellow and his friends speak only for one company. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the people of British Columbia talk about compensation. 
They want to know from the minister how much. 
How much will it cost Canadian people to pay for land claim settlements?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Systematically they undermine the aboriginal people. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is always like that with the Bloc. 
We are going to work on this issue in partnership with the provinces.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister does not seem to get it. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, look at the progress that has been made under the government. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
CN Rail is closing two more branch lines including the Imperial subdivision in my riding. 
Why the double standard?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Since those changes took effect the track record of the railways has been a failure.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
That shows the policy is working. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
This is the second report in two years reaching the same conclusion.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I am assured by officials that the positive recommendations will be implemented shortly.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Recommendations have been made. 
The new director has been given a mandate to implement them. 
The employees have been spoken to about this change.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is what you get when you unite the tripe, I guess.  
Why has the finance minister not put anything on the books? 
Where is this money to come from? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at the difference between the approaches here. 
If we look at our approach we are making progress with the Nisga'a. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has given permits. 
I am convinced that this project will be good for the environment. 
I will receive regular reports from my colleague on the remedial aspects of it.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I receive a number of memos and recommendations from my department. 
I always look at them carefully and with respect. 
I do the necessary follow-up in the best interests of my fellow citizens.  
We are following the situation very closely.  
I think we acted quickly and efficiently in the case of the ice storm. 
If more needs to be done, we will consider the matter with an open mind.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
MAIN ESTIMATES, 1998-99 
The House resumed consideration of the business of supply.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
We start at the bottom and work our way up. 
That is why the rules have been turned upside down.  
It makes an ass of the system.  
There is no control. 
Completing the Circle of Control''. 
It dealt with a lot of the problems I have raised here today. 
I believe that 52 recommendations were made. 
That is an excellent recommendation.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
The government has been turning a deaf ear for a long time. 
The Liberal government's priorities are very poorly defined. 
Unfortunately, the sombre list of Liberal nonsense does not end there.  
It needs only be properly applied. 
The problem is not the act, as I have said, but its application.  
For the benefit of the people listening to us, I shall quote him. 
I find this answer rather fascinating. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, yes I am calling quorum.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I invite the Liberals to stick around and listen. 
What I have to say is extremely interesting. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleague should not leave but listen. 
Once again, the Liberal government should be ashamed of the way it manages its priorities.  
They said that it was not strict enough, or this or that.  
Now they are on the other side. 
Among other things, it could introduce a money laundering bill. 
It is time the government used its money for legitimate purposes. 
It is time it admitted to making some bad choices. 
It costs a lot more in Quebec. 
One can see the ignorance of members opposite. 
Look at the figures.  
I get the impression that I taught them a few things today. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague with interest.  
Will my hon. colleague still be asking for that kind of help? 
Where would the money come from to fund that resource?  
This should come entirely under provincial jurisdiction.  
The present situation makes no sense. 
The federal government passes laws, but does not apply them. 
But, as it happens, it does not.  
As it happens, there is extremely expensive overlap and duplication. 
I can give another very recent example. 
The people across the floor may well laugh. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
My colleague referred to money laundering. 
This is cause for great concern. 
Who in this House walks around with ten bills of $1,000 in his pockets?  
Mr. Speaker, do you have ten bills of $1,000 in your pockets? 
It is very simple.  
An individual should be required to report the source of bills being deposited.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
MAIN ESTIMATES, 1998-99 
The House resumed consideration of the business of supply.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
I am splitting my time with the hon. member for Palliser.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I am speaking to the Department of Canadian Heritage estimates.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Dartmouth was splitting her time. 
I intend to elaborate on each line or point today.  
The Department of Justice serves the government in various ways. 
A network of regional offices provides most court representation services. 
Let us examine some of the areas the department is currently working on. 
One is the crime prevention strategy.  
We encourage all members of the House of Commons to told town hall meetings.  
There is no question of that. 
Conditional sentencing is another favourite topic of the opposition. 
Fearmongering is also part of Reform's strategy.  
We have acted despite the opposition saying that we do not act.  
There has been a constant debate in the House on firearms control. 
The opposition is out of touch with Canadians.  
We do not want children killing children in Canada.  
Concerning administration it is a third business line of the Department of Justice. 
To conclude, I believe the department is managing its resources responsibly. 
The department should be given the means to conduct its responsibilities.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
The member talked about spending more money. 
At that time the answer was no.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I have its latest report here. 
It cries out for an overhaul. 
Of course, there is all the business of money laundering.  
Mr. Speaker, first, we are not discussing school elections here. 
Political parties do not enter into it.  
I have never been involved in school elections. 
The Bloc gets involved in every one. 
Every time one is held, there they are. 
Three times they have got involved. 
They are involved in school elections. 
That said, I will answer the question.  
I may be mistaken- 
Right, on social conditions. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I asked that question very clearly. 
I repeated it and she refused to answer it. 
Her answer is on the record. 
My question is on the record and her non-answer is on the record. 
She ought to be ashamed of herself.  
Our police forces are slowly diminishing to the detriment of public safety. 
On page 10 is table III. 
They had been seized by police in other matters. 
Another example given was they would attend a domestic dispute. 
Of course they were never able to do that. 
The fact is that is a myth. 
Look at the polls. 
That is exactly what happened in all three of those provinces. 
We would not have the two territories saying the same thing.  
What is the government going to do? 
If someone deliberately and knowingly refuses or neglects to register their .22, 
The maximum penalty is 10 years in prison. 
Is that not wonderful? 
They will have to do that simply because they failed to fulfil an administrative requirement.  
However, the rapists are walking free. 
They do not care.  
This bill and the money that we are spending on this bill is wrong. 
Everyone is in favour of the common sense control of firearms. 
The legislation will allow the confiscation, without compensation, of thousands of firearms. 
Bill C-68 will prohibit over 500,000 handguns. 
The barrels are too short.  
This is property which has been lawfully acquired and legally held for years. 
It is going to be confiscated, ultimately, without any compensation. 
Again, this is wrong.  
There is no law covering them. 
Therefore, they will lose them, apparently without compensation.  
There was 72% per cent approval for that same system in rural communities.  
Those members just do not get it. 
The hon. member keeps referring to a letter which he says distorts the facts. 
In fact, he is distorting the facts. 
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting. 
She is asking me a question after she refused to answer mine. 
I will do what she did not do and answer the question.  
I have looked at both letters. 
The RCMP is saying that our statistics are true. 
But that is not what is in this book of theirs. 
They admitted it could very well create a false perception.  
The figures are wrong. 
They were wrong then and they are wrong now. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of brief questions for the hon. member.  
It is such a confusing mess. 
We just do not know.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I think it came to $181 to do that.  
The government is hiding the cost and I dare say for that very reason.  
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Obviously it will be necessary to invest some taxpayer dollars into priority areas. 
I will address the heavy responsibilities the department executes. 
There is service to the government itself. 
The government is responding and I support those initiatives.  
One that comes to mind very readily is the area of crime prevention strategy. 
It is very simple. 
They are very worried about the issue of youth justice. 
I share that concern as a Canadian and as a member of parliament. 
Mr. Speaker, I know you do as well.  
The minister is trying to respond to those concerns. 
She proposed a justice strategy to replace the Young Offenders Act. 
They expect the government to implement tougher penalties in this area.  
In this instance public safety must and will come first.  
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
I am very pleased to note the agreement of my colleague from Wild Rose. 
We could say that for any offender. 
The answer is not to lock them up and throw away the key. 
They have seen it. 
It needs to go further and I hope it will. 
We need to and will do more.  
That is not to be simplistic. 
To me it is quite obvious. 
Better access to information for victims. 
The whole idea needs to be explored. 
I suspect at this point we may digress.  
I have a number of concerns about some of the statements I have heard. 
I will simply state the following.  
I know what the officials in my community think. 
We were pleased to hear that.  
His explanation was not at all nebulous. 
That may be the case. 
The chief simply said his word for that was ``nonsense''.  
Seventy per cent of my constituents clearly supported the government in its action. 
Despite the heckling of the members opposite, those facts do not change.  
I think that evidence is very clear for anyone to see.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
With those remarks, I say I cannot support the motion.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
That is one example of unfairness.  
We are still waiting.  
I now go back to my main question to the distinguished member for London-Fanshawe. 
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from Frontenac-Megantic for his important questions.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member a couple of questions.  
I understand the compassion he has for people who are suffering in our land. 
I understand the member quite clearly on those things. 
I know he is concerned about the poverty that exists in this country. 
He also suggested that a lot of these problems can lead to crime.  
I agree that possibility exists.  
The latest figure I heard is a million. 
I feel good about that being a senior. 
That is what this government has spent. 
This spending is going on.  
Believe me it exists. 
Save bucks and help these people. 
When is it going to stop on that side?  
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
Madam Speaker, they are important questions.  
I know the member will be anxiously waiting for that.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Trudeau's participation implicitly validated the referendum process in Quebec. 
In 1995 there was a referendum campaign. 
The debate was fierce, fair, and intense, but it was always serene. 
This is the great quality that Quebeckers have. 
Of course, the federal government took part in the process. 
What did the government do to achieve this? 
It asked the supreme court to rule on the issue.  
This is what is happening with the supreme court. 
We can even tell you what the court's ruling will be. 
I will give another example of how little the government- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must interrupt the hon. member. 
These debates were allowed by the Speaker of the House. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The intention is laudable; we are always in favour of fighting crime.  
Many stakeholders in Quebec and even outside Quebec have said so. 
Without Bill C-37, what is the status of judges' salaries? 
So that is something already.  
It is a matter of societal choices. 
We have seen all this. 
What are this government's priorities? 
The money goes to the judges, rather than the disadvantaged. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Two points must be made. 
We have spoken about this on several occasions. 
That said, this question obviously warrants consideration. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
That is a lot of money.  
I now come to my main question for my distinguished colleague, the member for Charlesbourg. 
Mr. Speaker, we can indeed talk about justice in general. 
That is what the government is saying. 
This shows that the government does not know the first thing about being fair.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
In all the speeches earlier this afternoon leading up to this debate we heard- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are off track. 
We should bring the debate back to justice.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
They are going to solve all of these problems. 
These people are just wonderful.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Okay, we are even. 
Let us start all over again.  
Mr. Speaker, would you reset the clock. 
I would like a full, uninterrupted 20 minutes. 
I am sure that will be difficult. 
It is quite clear to me what the strategy is. 
What they fail to understand is that they simply add ammunition. 
Well maybe he could not sneak up. 
They think ``Oh goody goody'' and they run back. 
This is the new kind of politics the Reform Party has brought to Ottawa. 
Reform members are stealing apples. 
It is truly a remarkable thing to watch.  
They are supposed to be debating estimates and spending''. 
The government record is quite extensive. 
That is not what this government did. 
We reduced the size of government by $14 billion. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is supposed to be on justice and on the estimates. 
What in the world is he offering this House on this motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It was a difficult time for me because she had friends watching. 
The hon. member for Crowfoot is quite right. 
Mr. Speaker, it is quite interesting. 
Canadians need to know why we are here. 
I know the member would not understand. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair would ask that you stay on topic.  
I would not want to lose your confidence. 
Reformers think they should have the control over the judges. 
Where is the justice?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Crowfoot has made his point.  
I am sure they will not like what I am about to say.  
That is fairly fundamental and simple for the Canadian people to understand.  
What the Reform would do is totally turn our Confederation upside down. 
I do not see the justice in that. 
I was a councillor for almost 10 years. 
My wife sits on municipal council in Mississauga in the region of Peel. 
I have very strong roots in municipal government. 
Guess what happens when that is done? 
Guess who takes it in the end? 
Municipalities rely on the provinces. 
It is a matter of trust.  
``I am not going to accept the limo,'' and now rides around in a limo. 
They would form what was it called, the Re-Bloc party. 
Imagine what kind of a justice system that would be. 
There is no question that without strong leadership there would be no justice.  
It is not justice. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
First, he said that the justice system cannot survive without strong leadership. 
We agree with that. 
But I caught that phrase and he is absolutely right. 
There is no justice in this country.  
They want to give that impression. 
It is just not the truth. 
There are good guys and bad guys. 
There is no question that there are difficulties.  
This government is committed to ensuring that there is stability. 
That is the key, bringing stability into the justice system. 
Appeal it, yes; repeal it, no. 
Stability will maintain good justice in this country.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
However, I would suggest that the question is a fair question. 
It tried to wrap it in the justice system.  
If the member wants, he could look at my remarks in Hansard . 
I have no difficulty with that. 
I do not much care what anyone does with their own private life. 
I do not think it drives a political agenda. 
We should not discriminate against anyone in this country. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
It has ballooned to $133.9 million and counting.  
We need them in Saint John, New Brunswick. 
We need them in every municipality. 
Why are we wasting this money?  
I know we do in Peel. 
The member's question was about gun control. 
I think the Canadian people have spoken very clearly on that issue. 
My goodness, we register our dogs in this country. 
We register our cars. 
We register our boats. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I do know one thing. 
He talked about Reformers wanting to string somebody up. 
It is not going to save one life.  
However, they cannot because it will not. 
It is a big waste of money.  
My apologies, Wild Rose. 
He is wild, I must say.  
I am happy to talk about this because it is such a simple issue. 
Does that require a death? 
Does it require that kind of activity?  
The common sense of this is so clear. 
No one should object to this. 
As I said before, we register our vehicles. 
We absolutely must follow through with this. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In debate the first person up is the person who is recognized. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In debate it goes back and forth. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
How interesting, we get a reaction once in a while. 
I welcome this opportunity today to speak on justice. 
There are problems in this respect. 
I speak about women because of my own experiences. 
But men have the same experiences sometimes, and children often do. 
Sometimes it is a matter of threats. 
If threats are involved, the judge issues a a restraining order. 
This is just a piece of paper. 
There is a problem here. 
There is no justification for attacking someone. 
There is no justification for raping someone.  
Often, children are involved and are also victims. 
We must work and make resources available to try to stop this vicious cycle. 
Locking them up is not the answer. 
That is how we will lower the crime rate in this country. 
There should be none. 
First we need good, healthy people. 
To return to the judges, they too need education. 
He was found not guilty, because he did not know the difference. 
No is no, yesterday, today or tomorrow. 
This worries me, because I see many decisions being taken.  
They are all volunteers who work very hard. 
They will find sources of assistance for people. 
Yet the will is there. 
There are many volunteers raising money here and there. 
They deserve to be congratulated. 
But the government must not rely on these resources alone.  
There are many of them. 
There is a need for a very safe place where people can go. 
I needed a half-way house a number of years ago. 
There was one in my area in those days. 
My son was well treated because the resources were available. 
They can be teenagers too. 
There are lots of young people who turn up every Tuesday. 
Priority must be given to this, because no child is born bad. 
That is a pity, in my opinion, because often, the resources are not available. 
These are young people that can be helped.  
Not in the least. 
The governments of this country will one day have to establish the priority. 
Poverty and stress are increasing. 
Think of the stress with the cutting of 45,000 federal jobs.  
There is violence everywhere. 
Family violence is not limited to the poor. 
Violence can be found at all levels.  
It is the same with young offenders. 
They do not come just from poor families. 
Work needs to be done with them. 
Until it is, we are missing the boat and by a long shot.  
I would also like to talk about registration of firearms. 
It keeps going up and up. 
In the regions, cuts continue to be made. 
It is a problem for the people in our ridings.  
That is not true. 
There are a lot of disturbing factors there. 
Responsibilities must be assumed.  
It can put someone in jail. 
It is a very large majority. 
It is a lot of money.  
We have to make prevention a top priority and provide funds for it. 
It should begin in the the schools starting at kindergarten. 
All kinds of children may be physically abused or sexually abused. 
It does not only start at the age of 10 years. 
Until we do that I have no doubt that crime will increase.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
It is true that there are many volunteers doing some really good work right now. 
I congratulate the member. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my Liberal colleague. 
When one has experienced difficulties oneself, one understands.  
That is why this deserves our attention.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
That is a tremendous amount of money. 
Yet we have tremendous dissatisfaction and discomfort with all the services that are delivered.  
What we need is prevention. 
That is all part of crime prevention. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Certainly that is most unfortunate. 
This legislation is not about confiscation. 
The practices embodied in the statute reflect the prudent practices of those responsible people.  
The legitimate practices of those responsible owners can all be continued under this statute. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
It had nothing to do with gun control.  
I would like to know that.  
There are literally thousands of guns on the streets. 
How is that going to prevent crime?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
I sat for 10 years as a member of the Waterloo regional police commission. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
I think it deserves an answer.  
We have had hand gun registration in Canada since 1935. 
I think the member for South Shore made a very important point.  
We know criminals are not going to register their long guns. 
They did not register their handguns either, we know that. 
In rural areas like I represent, it is a real inconvenience. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, once again the member has not answered the question. 
They are not committing crimes with these guns.  
Why can the member not understand the question? 
It is put about as simply as we can possibly put it. 
It is a terminology of slang used in information systems. 
If you put in garbage, you get garbage out. 
These are realities and facts. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
I reject outright the premise that the registration system will not work. 
For example, I live on the family farm. 
We have those kind of things that are required from time to time. 
We are not after those kinds of people. 
They will be licensed and we will keep track of what they have. 
That is a reasonable thing to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
I want to take a different turn on the justice discussion. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Justice is about people and how it affects them. 
In any case there was a deficiency that caused an awful problem.  
The RCMP have investigated this. 
The family of Mr. James Mills has waited seven years for an answer. 
There is no answer. 
There is no explanation of how he was murdered. 
All he wants is an answer. 
We were hopeful that he would bring information with him. 
That did not arrive. 
We have brought up questions in the House of Commons month after month. 
We have been in the media. 
Where was the deficiency? 
Where did the system fail? 
How did the other parts of the justice system fail? 
Was it lack of training? 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would like to catch the mood of the House. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We asked for a final report from Corrections Canada. 
It is public relations and there is nothing in it for the police. 
I read in the Toronto Sun on June 7 ``another $32 million down the drain''. 
We now have the fewest number of police officers since 1972. 
As far as I know it is the municipal authorities and not the federal government. 
I fail to see why he is referring to our crime prevention initiative. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
The RCMP certainly play a big role in my part of the country. 
It is a federal agency, federally funded and federally paid.  
That is where I think the money should be going instead of to these programs.  
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
I do not want Canada to turn out that way. 
Does he believe that municipalities do not pay for the services of the RCMP? 
I think he is on a stretch here.  
Mr. Speaker, I would say the opposite is true. 
The member also asked whether I believed in gun control. 
I certainly believe in gun control. 
This is all about a gun registry, not gun control. 
We put it in and put it in well.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I almost hate to interrupt.  
Read it again, please.  
I will read the motion in a minute. 
Is there consent to put it?  
There is no consent.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
We did not have an opposition that was interested in being an opposition. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent to pass the motion?
